<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Cambridge, MA, July 14, 2020: <a href="https://tiledb.com/">TileDB, Inc.</a> has secured a $15M Series A investment round led by <a href="https://twobearcapital.com/">Two Bear Capital</a>, joined by <a href="https://uncorrelated.com/">Uncorrelated Ventures</a> and all existing investors: <a href="https://nexusvp.com/">Nexus Venture Partners</a>, <a href="http://www.intelcapital.com/">Intel Capital</a>, and <a href="https://bigpi.vc/">Big Pi Ventures</a>. The funding will help the company expand go-to-market and product development for its “universal data engine,” a novel database that goes beyond tables to manage any complex data and beyond SQL to analyze the data with any tool, all serverless and at planet scale. Montana philanthropist and Two Bear Capital Managing Partner Mike Goguen will join TileDB’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The Series A financing comes after TileDB was chosen by customers who experienced two key pains: scalability for complex data and deployment. Whole-genome population data, single-cell gene data, spatio-temporal satellite imagery, and asset-trading data all share multi-dimensional structures that are poorly handled by monolithic databases, tables, and legacy file formats. Newer computational frameworks evolved to offer “pluggable storage” but that forces another part of the stack to deal with data management. As a result, organizations waste resources on managing a sea of files and optimizing storage performance, tasks traditionally done by the database. Moreover, developers and data scientists are spending excessive time in data engineering and deployment, instead of actual analysis and collaboration.</p>
<p>“We flipped the data management model,” said Dr. Stavros Papadopoulos, CEO and original creator of TileDB. “We invented a database that focuses on universal storage and data management rather than the compute layer, which we’ve instead made `pluggable.` We cleared the path for analytics professionals and data scientists by taking over the messiest parts of data management, such as optimized storage for all data types on numerous backends, data versioning, metadata, access control within or outside organizational boundaries, and logging. On top, we developed numerous APIs for fast direct data access and efficient integrations with a growing set of popular tools such as Spark, Dask, MariaDB and PrestoDB. Finally, we built a serverless infrastructure for easy, secure cross-organizational sharing and scalable compute, called TileDB Cloud.”</p>
<p>According to Scott Soenen, VP of Product Engineering at Capella Space: “The partnership with TileDB gelled perfectly with our desire to deliver a new level of innovation in open data programs aimed at the geospatial community. Open data alone isn’t enough. It’s also about easy access to compute resources and versatility of analytics. TileDB Cloud removes multiple manual steps in data access for the geospatial developer community and offers intuitive self-service and interactive analytics."</p>
<p>“We have chosen TileDB as the storage engine to power our cellxgene project at CZI, which is an interactive data explorer for single-cell transcriptomics datasets,” said Bruce Martin, Director of Engineering, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. “TileDB provides an easy and powerful way to manage our huge array data on various backends, including cloud object stores. The serverless infrastructure of TileDB Cloud opens the door to extreme scale with very low engineering efforts on our part, allowing us to focus more on scientific discoveries instead.”</p>
<p>Magnus Isaksson, Director of Bioinformatics, Helix shared, “The synergy between our two companies has enabled us to take an innovative approach to storing and analyzing genomic data at population-scale. We were excited to find TileDB after extensive diligence of potential solutions that could meet Helix's needs and advance our vision to revolutionize population health via the power of genomics."</p>
<p>“Many of the world’s most urgent problems - from COVID to climate change - require the analysis of large volumes of data in order to find solutions. TileDB’s technology addresses the infrastructure deficit that adds friction, delay, and cost to generating the key insights and discoveries needed from this data,” said Mike Goguen, Managing Partner at Two Bear Capital and lead investor. “We are excited to partner with Stavros and TileDB to build an enduring company delivering massive value for the developers and enterprise customers working to solve these and other critically important problems.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before and during the development of the Bythlon safety performance pedal system's technology, we comprehensively researched <a href="https://bythlon-pedal.myshopify.com/pages/cycling-science" title="Cycling Science">cycling science</a>, especially the biomechanics of the pedal stroke, the technology, and the benefits of the existing clipless pedal systems.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We could confirm from the widely publicized benefits that cleats indeed secure the shoe in place on the pedal to prevent slipping and that the purposely developed road bike shoes with extremely stiff soles improve pedal power and most likely reduce the risk of injury.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the main argument for cleats dates back to the days where cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with shoe clips and straps. The idea behind that is to generate a 'perfect' stroke, pedaling with one leg pushing down while the other is pulling up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most cyclists accept this as a foregone conclusion. There is probably no cyclist who has not heard the advice to aim for a 'round' pedal stroke. The cleat pedal is probably perceived as the essential bike component that separates the casual or novice from the ambitious and experienced rider, even more so than carbon frames or wheels.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So we were in a big surprise when we came across several articles and a video that was describing '</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-d5K812TyI" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Myth of The Upstroke</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.'&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We learned that the presenter of this video, a sport biomechanist and advisor to the United States Olympic Committee, Dr. Jeff Broker, had tested more than a hundred cyclists' pedal strokes from the 1980s onwards. None of these elite and professional cyclists he tested over ten years produced a meaningful upstroke.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-d5K812TyI" target="_blank" title="Dr Jeff Broker speaks at 2012 International Cyclefit Symposium - 2012 - &quot;The Myth of The Upstroke&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0279/6345/7589/files/Screenshot_2019-11-22_at_13.15.11.png?v=1574399731" alt="Cyclist do not pull in cirles nor do they truly pull up in the upstroke " width="319" height="242"></a></p>
<meta charset="utf-8"><meta name="uuid" content="uuid77qzHBcs36HS"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He developed an early power force model and called it '</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">cycling clock diagram.</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">' It is still in use today and frequently cited in publications. It clearly shows that there is no 'pull' in the recovery phase (upstroke).</span></p>

<meta charset="utf-8"><meta name="uuid" content="uuid77qzHBcs36HS"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He first published his findings with his colleagues Robert Gregor and M. Ryan in 1991 (</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21220076_The_biomechanics_of_cycling" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The biomechanics of cycling</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">). It appeared to them that there is no 'pull' and that the entire aspect of pulling through the upstroke is a myth. That opened an entirely new element to our research. Since we found several comprehensive studies and publications citing and confirming his results, including studies researching if these results would change with&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/02c5/2dc037e07d44a68b89e21526c6b9ebb3796e.pdf?_ga=2.148566004.252372768.1574487523-1137627527.1574234326" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">uphill cycling</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, we dived deeper into this.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While these studies are apparently confirming Dr. Broker's findings, they are highly scientific, often limited to a handful of participants, decades-old, and therefore the sensors used custom builds. The interpretation of the laboratory data is often difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today there are many different power meters and software applications readily available that allow us to approach our research not only from the laboratory but from the field.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We took a closer look at how the results modern power meters deliver and how they are displayed. Power meters from Garmin, Pioneer, and Favero are some of the meters popular with cyclists, and all come with mobile and website apps showing the results.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We first searched online and found thousands of results posted by individuals. For data privacy reasons, we leave it to anybody interested to browse these results and post here result diagram examples from the companies' websites.</p>

The Power Phase diagram shows how the power is produced and wherein the cycle the most power, The Power Phase, is produced. Undeniable is the absence of any power in the upstroke as it has been marked with 'No Power'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Interestingly this is very similar to Dr. Broker's tests almost forty years ago. The graphic shows no power in the upstroke, and the lack of thereof is apparent as well in the pedaling graph next to it. (Update: Pioneer sold its related technology to Shimano and cased selling at the end of March 2020.)</p>

The Power Phase and Peak Phase graphic symbolized by the red arc segment on the power cycle indicates where the power begins and ends. The green arc shows the Power Phase Peak, which is the segment where 50% of the total power is produced. The upstroke is marked with the words 'No Power.'</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At this point, we believe it is fair to say that The Myth of the Upstroke has been debunked by scientists and field data from many thousands' individual cyclists as a popular misconception.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>So before our conclusion, let us look into Eriscon's and later finding regarding the muscle groups involved. The pedal stroke generates force by hip and knee extension and flexion. An extension is used pushing down during the power phase, and flexion is used to recover the pedal back to the top of the cycle for the next downstroke.</p>
<p>Glutes, Quads, and Calfs work together, pushing down and Hip Flexor and Hamstring pulling up. Just by looking at the size of these muscle groups, we realize that the extensor muscles are much larger than than the flexors.</p>
<p>That makes sense since the legs functional movements, the daily life's moves are all related to pushing: Walking, running, squatting, and lifting all require the legs to push. The only pulling movement in daily life is to lift the leg up for another step. It never has to raise more than its weight, if you disregard the weight of shoes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nowadays, developing <strong>ReactJS</strong> with TypeScript gives us a solid way to write applications: it adds the advantage of type-safety, component auto-documentation, error handling, and accurate autocomplete in the editor code. However, it still requires a considerable effort to write <em>types</em> and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seems redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GraphQL Code Generator</strong></a>&nbsp;gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:&nbsp;</strong>forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong>&nbsp;as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the&nbsp;<strong>dependencies</strong>&nbsp;needed:</p><pre><p><span>1</span><span>npm</span><span> i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre><pre><p><span>1</span><span>npm</span><span> i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre><p>I'm considering the following&nbsp;<strong>folder structure</strong>, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><p><span>1</span><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>2</span><span> ┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>3</span><span> ┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>4</span><span> ┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>5</span><span> ┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>6</span><span> ┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>7</span><span> ┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>8</span><span> ┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>9</span><span> ┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>10</span><span> ┗ package.json</span></p></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project,&nbsp;named <code>codegen.yml</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Webhooks run a large portion of the "magic" that happens between applications. They are sometimes called reverse APIs, callbacks, and even notifications. Many services, such as SendGrid, Stripe, Slack, and GitHub use events to send webhooks as part of their API. This allows your application to listen for events and perform actions when they happen.</p>
<p>In a previous article, we looked at how to <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/consuming-webhooks-with-node-js-and-express/">consume webhooks with Node.js and Express</a>. In this article we'll look at how you can listen for webhooks using Python (v3+) with the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>You can jump directly to the code for either framework through one of the links below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#receiveawebhookwithflask">Receive a webhook with Flask</a></li>
<li><a href="#receiveawebhookwithdjango">Receive a webhook with Django</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This guide assumes you have Python v3 installed on your machine. You can find details on installing python at the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">official downloads page</a>. Depending on your setup, the <code>python</code> command you want to use may be <code>python3</code>.</p>
<p>You can confirm the installed version by running the following from the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>python --version
</code></pre>
<p>or, if that displays a version below 3:</p>
<pre><code>python3 --version
</code></pre>
<p>For the shell commands listed throughout this tutorial, use whichever command is associated with your local installation of python.</p>
<h2 id="whatisawebhook">What is a webhook</h2>
<p>Webhooks are called reverse APIs for a reason. Instead of your application sending a request to the API, the API sends the request to your application. While the concept may sound different, the way that we consume webhooks is the same way that an API consumes a request.</p>
<p>In most web frameworks, there is the concept of a route. A route allows the application to respond with specific content or data when the user visits a specific URL. The same idea applies to APIs. When you send a request to GitHub for details about a specific organization, such as <code>https://api.github.com/orgs/Bearer</code>, the route is <code>/orgs/:org</code> where <code>:org</code> is the name of the organization.</p>
<p>The same concept is applied when receiving webhooks. We establish a route, tell the service where to send the data, and our application sits and waits until a request comes in to that route.</p>
<p>There are a few consistencies across webhook implementations.</p>
<ol>
<li>They are normally <code>POST</code> requests.</li>
<li>They receive JSON data.</li>
<li>They need to respond quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some APIs will require that your application respond within a certain amount of time, otherwise the event will be re-sent. For example, the <a href="https://api.slack.com/events-api#responding_to_events">Slack API</a> expects a response back within three seconds.</p>
<h2 id="receiveawebhookwithflask">Receive a webhook with Flask</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask framework</a> is a lightweight Python web framework that describes itself as "micro". This allows you to use just what you need, then add more structure later as your project grows.</p>
<p>For our purposes, this is great as we are only concerned with routing. Make sure Python is installed, then run the following command in your terminal to install flask:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install Flask
</code></pre>
<p>You can find full installation and setup details on at the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/">Flask documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Next, create a <code>.py</code> file, such as <code>main.py</code> and add the following:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask, request, Response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def respond():
    print(request.json);
    return Response(status=200)
</code></pre>
<p>This code imports the Flask class along with the request and Response objects. Then instantiates it with a name of <code>__name__</code> before assigning it to the <code>app</code> variable. This naming scheme is convention in the Flask documentation.</p>
<p>Next, we use the <code>@app.route</code> decorator to listen for <code>POST</code> requests made against the <code>/webhook</code> path. This decorator calls the function that immediately follows it when a request is made to the route. In this case, that is the <code>respond</code> function.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this example, we <code>print</code> out the request as json, then return a <code>Response</code> with a status code of 200. This response tells the sender that we received the hook. You should be able to run the server using Flask's preferred technique:</p>
<pre><code>export FLASK_APP=main.py
python -m flask run
</code></pre>
<p>Thats's it! We now have an app that listens for a webhook with python and flask. Once deployed, <code>POST</code> requests made to the endpoint will trigger the <code>respond</code> function. For example: <code>https://exampledomain.com/webhook</code>. This is also the URL that you will provide the the service that sends the webhook.</p>
<h2 id="receiveawebhookwithdjango">Receive a webhook with Django</h2>
<p>Setting up an application in Django is more automated than Flask, but that also comes with a more elaborate file structure. As a more traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, Django scaffolds out the main parts of the project for you. A full installation guide is available on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/start/">the official Django documentation page</a>, but it can also be installed with <code>pip</code> using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install Django
</code></pre>
<p>If you're setting up a project from scratch, use the <code>django-admin</code> utility to create a new project. If you already have an existing Django project that you want to add webhooks to, skip to the next step.</p>
<pre><code>django-admin startproject example-project
</code></pre>
<p>This sets up the basis for a new Django project. Navigate to the newly created folder, and you should see a structure similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>example-project/
    manage.py
    example-project/
    __init__.py
    settings.py
    urls.py
    asgi.py
    wsgi.py
</code></pre>
<p>We can confirm that everything worked by running <code>python manage.py runserver</code>.</p>
<p>Django's convention is to set up "apps" within this outer "project". You can avoid this and set up a single-app project by running <code>django-admin startproject example-project .</code> with a trailing period (.) instead. For this tutorial, we'll mirror the preferred way as shown previously.</p>
<p>To do that, we'll set up an "app" called <strong>webhooks</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>python manage.py startapp webhooks
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a new directory called <strong>webhooks</strong>. Great! Now we can write some code. We'll be focused on three files: <code>webhooks/views.py</code>, <code>webhooks/urls.py</code> (not yet created), and <code>example-site/urls.py</code>.</p>
<p>Open the file <code>webhooks/views.py</code>. Here we will write the logic for handling a route.</p>
<pre><code>from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views.decorators.http import require_POST

@require_POST
def example(request):
	return HttpResponse('Hello, world. This is the webhook response.')
</code></pre>
<p>This code does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It imports the <code>HttpResponse</code> object that will be used to send a response.</li>
<li>It imports a special decorator to limit the request method. In Django, routes accept all HTTP methods by default and let the views manage which methods they respond to.</li>
<li>Calls the decorator to limit the function that follows to only the <code>POST</code> method.</li>
<li>Defines a function, named <code>example</code> that takes the request as an argument and returns a response.</li>
</ul>
<p>This <code>example</code> function's name will be linked to our <code>urls.py</code> file shortly. It does not need to align to a specific path.</p>
<p>Next, create <code>webhooks/urls.py</code> if it doesn't already exist. This is where we organize routes within this sub-app of our project.</p>
<pre><code>from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('example/', views.example)
]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we import <code>path</code> from <code>django.urls</code>. It defines individual routes and associates them with views. We next import all views. Finally, <code>urlpatterns</code> is passed a list of paths. This list is recognized by Django as the routes associated with the application.</p>
<p>In this instance, we define a path that targets <code>example/</code> and is associated with the view <code>views.example</code>, which was the name of our function in <code>views.py</code>.</p>
<p>With this done, our application works, but we need to tell the outer project about it. Open <code>example-project/urls.py</code>. It should look similar to the previous file, but with an existing <code>admin</code> route. Add a new path like so:</p>
<pre><code>urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('webhooks/', include('webhooks.urls'))
]
</code></pre>
<p>If your server stopped, run it again with <code>python manage.py runserver</code>. Now try making a POST request to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/webhooks/example/</code> (replace the host and port with your own if they differ).</p>
<p>With that, we have set up a Django project that listens for a webhook at <code>/webhooks/example</code>. Once deployed, append this path to the full URL and provide the full URL to the service that sends the webhook.</p>
<h2 id="testingwebhookslocally">Testing webhooks locally</h2>
<p>To test webhooks locally without deploying, we need to open up a connection from our development machine to the outside world.</p>
<p>One option is to use <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>. This service allows you to provide outside access to a specific port on your local machine. This works great for our needs. To get started, sign up and follow the installation and getting started instructions.</p>
<p>Once done, if you're on MacOS, you should be able to run <code>./ngrok http 3000</code> in your terminal where 3000 is replaced with the port of your running Python application. For example, a default Django site often runs on port 8000.</p>
<p>Once up and running, ngrok will provide you with a url that you can use to test your webhook. In Bearer, we provide a "test" button in our Notification settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/bearer-webhook.png" alt="Webhook setup in Bearer"></p>
<p>Once configured, you'll start receiving webhooks at that URL. Don't forget to change it over to the final, deployed webhook URL once development and testing are complete.</p>
<h2 id="whatcanyoudowiththisinformation">What can you do with this information?</h2>
<p>Once a webhook is configured, it is up to you how to handle the information it receives. You can use this information to react to events in real-time, feature flip parts of your application, or even use it as a way to write data to a database. There are countless capabilities your webhook can have depending on what kind of information the API provider sends.</p>
<p>While we built a basic implementation in this article, it is worth mentioning that many services offer ways to validate that a request is coming from the actual source. This can be done by limiting the URLs that access your application, or by matching a secret key. GitHub, for example, allows you to set a secret that will be sent with each webhook.</p>
<p>Explore the documentation for the services you use to see how best to work within their setup. If you like the idea of using webhooks to react to monitoring changes with your third-party API providers, <a href="https://bearer.sh/">check out what we're building at Bearer.sh</a>.</p>

        Between 23:54 UTC yesterday (2020-07-20) and 15:35 UTC today, we suffered from a catastrophic SQL failure which forced us to restore from backup.</p><p>

There may be some credit issues where the system granted more or fewer credits than you expect for work done during this time.<br>
I can't apologize enough. If our BOINC deployment was architected for scale rather than for low cost, we could've avoided this.</p><p>

There are several enhancements to our infrastructure and upgrades we'd like to make, such as migrating services to Kubernetes and potentially using a managed SQL service.</p><p>

If you were here during beta-testing, you might have received a very early version of panorama tasks, and the eagle-eyed among you may have seen the application details <a href="https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/server_status.php" rel="nofollow">on the server status page</a>.</p><p>

<span><b>The panorama app is a CUDA-only app for Linux and Windows with an Nvidia driver version of 418.96 or higher.</b></span></p><p>

This project attempts to find the world seed of the iconic panorama image which appeared in the background of the main menu of Minecraft between 2011 and 2018. The first phase of this project will only last a few days, and we shall update you with their progress in the coming weeks.</p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3dyexWe.png"></p><p>

Right now, the application is quite substantial. Unlike the OpenCL applications for the Kaktwoos project, <b>if you allow BOINC to run tasks always; you may experience some stuttering or lag in your desktop environment while running these tasks</b>. These tasks do not have checkpointing support, but run in around 1 hour on an average host to mitigate the majority of lost cycles.</p><p>

<span>As always, <a href="https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/prefs.php?subset=project" rel="nofollow">you can change which projects of which you decide to participate in your user preferences</a>.</span></p><p>

Let us know if you have any questions, and as always join the discussion over on <a href="https://discord.gg/xVFh9bp" rel="nofollow">the Discord server.</a>

    <div><p><span>Kaktwoos 2.03 and Badges!</span><br>

        You may have seen many workunits just disappear from existence today.</p><p>

<img src="https://munin.kiska.pw/munin-cgi/munin-cgi-graph/Munin-Node/Munin-Node/results_minecraftathome-pinpoint=1594193183,1594247603.png?&amp;lower_limit=&amp;upper_limit=&amp;size_x=400&amp;size_y=200"></p><p>

Worry not! We realised there were far too many workunits scanning duplicate seeds, so we've scaled back the original workunits to the correct seed ranges <span><i>(no in-progress results were touched, so none of you should have lost any credit)</i></span>.</p><p>

We have located some promising seed candidates which were missed from processing and can be used as an input to this job, so they are currently set as the highest priority.</p><p>

Also, <span><b>we now have badges</b></span>! If you view the forums, any comments in threads, or on the leaderboards; you will see the new badges.<br>
We're open to suggestions for future badges, so please leave us some comments on this thread.

        In the last news post, I advised everyone to create a profile in order to be eligible for 'user of the day' selection.<br>
Unfortunately, there was an issue with the ReCaptcha implementation which prevented this. This issue is now resolved.</p><p>

Now, you are able to <a href="https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/create_profile.php" rel="nofollow">create a profile here</a>.</p><p>

Also, good news for hosts with OpenCL capable hardware from more than one vendor <i>(e.g. an Intel iGPU and an Nvidia GPU)</i><br>
The latest update to the kaktwoos app should ensure the tasks run on the correct device.<br>
If you are a user with a multi-vendor host, please keep an eye on your results and let us know if you're having any issues.</p><p>

<h4><i>Seeking creative space, I spent two months exploring productivity and tools for thought. Here's what I discovered.</i></h4>

<p>I recently learned that Netflix tested a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/02/netflix-too-much-to-watch-speed-watching">speed-watching</a>” feature and it seems the most apt metaphor for our era. Too much content stressing you out? Try watching it faster. Far more likely is that it’ll go on some sort of list. A watch it, read, it, do it later sort of list. These lists have become a digital extension of <a href="https://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/07/10223435/Tsunduko_.jpg">Tsundoku</a>: the Japanese art of buying books and not reading them. Now we hoard ideas, articles, and links and never do anything with them.</p>

<p>This feeling can be stressful, as our creative need to engage with the world collides with relentless change, particularly for those in the digital sphere. In 2019, Nobel prize-winning Psychologist Daniel Kahneman said that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKSts1lNZhc&amp;feature=emb_title">Technology evolves exponentially, whereas our mechanisms for coping are linear</a>”, and that struck a chord. Never has this been more evident than now, mid-pandemic, as we exchange the subtle, reassuring friction of normal living for the “always-on”, performance mode of online existence.</p>

<p>This isn’t new, though. In 2012, Cal Newport wrote about knowledge workers lacking <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/">a culture of improving their systems of work</a>. Rather than improve our process, we tend to focus on managing email, and lots of it. Technology, it seems, has opened up incredible opportunities while contributing to a “great frazzling” of our collective minds. Yet there is something different about the current situation we find ourselves in. In particular, the digital impact of the pandemic. One of my favourite writers, <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr">Venkatesh Rao</a>, recently hinted at the significance of this shift:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Software eating the world is going through an inflection point I thought wouldn’t arrive till 2030. The pandemic has accelerated the schedule by 10 years. <a href="https://pca.st/mm2vlx3d">[source]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even for those who wouldn’t consider themselves very tech-inclined, it’s easy to see the truth in this. Couples are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-weddings-during-coronavirus-photos-2020-4?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">getting married via Zoom</a>. Parents can <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/07/facetime-babies/">FaceTime babies in neonatal units.</a> A woman <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/potato-boss-video-call">accidentally turned herself into a potato during a digital happy hour</a>. <strong>Software is the world now.</strong> And it would be nice if we made it work for us, for once.</p>

<h2 id="second-brains">Second Brains</h2>

<p>During Ireland’s lockdown, I found myself with more time to explore this thought. By chance I came across Tiago Forte’s <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/"><em>Building a Second Brain</em></a>, which advertised a “<em>world-class idea management system in 35 days</em>.” It sounded fascinating, albeit outside my price range. I read around the area instead, starting with some of his early work. His first course seemed useful, called <em><a href="https://learn.fortelabs.co/p/get-stuff-done-like-a-boss">Get Stuff Done</a>,</em> and I signed up. It was a digital-reimagining of David Allen’s famous <em><a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a>:</em> a book I had read when younger. At the time I had found it difficult to integrate as it was so rooted in physical artefacts like folders and paper. A tough sell, when my life was becoming ever more digital.</p>

</figure>

<p>The course was excellent, and finally cemented the GTD workflow for me with digital tools, but Tiago hinted at a more important takeaway. He suggested that automating our daily efforts saves us mental energy, and frees us to focus on the creative, interesting parts of life. Right there was a glimmer of something more valuable: that high-leverage digital tools could help me spend more time having fun with ideas. I was obsessed.</p>

<p>I decided to follow Tiago’s structure of <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/"><em>PARA</em></a> (Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives) and practice of <em><a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1142899542360297473">CODE</a></em> (Collect, Organise, Distill, Express) to structure my notes, and committed to it for a couple of weeks. Every so often, an idea would form, which I would capture, and over time it would either “bubble-up” by my returning to it, or would fade out as it wasn’t significant or relevant. The effort was low, but the return was high. I concerned myself less with management and more on what I found interesting. The result, after a month or so, had no fanfare, or celebration. In fact, it was almost anticlimactic, as there was no reactivity, stress, or concern. Left instead was a stillness that you could feel bored with, if you were of that persuasion. Instead, I found myself thinking, creating, and exploring far more in this new free space.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, I dug deeper. I learned about the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1">Zettelkasten Method</a>, by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y"><em>How to Take Smart Notes</em></a>, both likely geneses for <em>Building a Second Brain.</em> I doubled-down on earlier attempts at noise-reduction by reading Cal Newport’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">Deep Work</a></em> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Minimalism-Living-Better-Technology-ebook/dp/B07D1G6DTF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IMCD9N2NEGR1&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=digital+minimalism&amp;qid=1594227304&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=digital+min%2Camazon-devices%2C157&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Digital Minimalism</em></a>. My phone went on permanent “Do Not Disturb” and I found healthy space in a fixed and sustainable schedule. I became a lab rat for these ideas, because <em>they actually worked</em>.</p>

<p>Coupling these three strategies together: <strong>automating the daily, repeatable parts of living</strong>, <strong>reducing external noise,</strong> and <strong>building an ad-hoc knowledge graph</strong>, created a situation I so longed for — the possibility of taking on well-defined personal projects with specific outcomes, knowing that if I had new ideas along the way, I wouldn’t lose them. In fact, they may even have improved by the time I engaged with them.</p>

<p>To test this further, I started two courses by Dr. Barbara Oakley called <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift">Mindshift</a>.</em> I found significant parallels between Dr Oakley’s description of how the mind creates knowledge “chunks” and creating notes in my “<em>Second Brain</em>”, as both develop knowledge graphs that aid creativity. I took notes throughout, often finding that they sparked associations between notes in very different areas — a phenomenon Dr Oakley calls <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/mrPn2/the-value-of-a-library-of-chunks">Transfer</a>.</em> Linking these concepts was trivial now, as they were just nodes in a digital graph.</p>

<p>I had found a solution to Cal Newport’s concerns, and it didn’t involve sending email.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-it-down">Breaking It Down</h2>

<p>If you’re a knowledge worker starting this journey, you too may feel overwhelmed at the amount that life and work expects of you. If you have no system at all, writing down all the tasks required of you on a single sheet of paper is a great start. This brain dump is essential, as we have limited working memory (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/X7E9r/introduction-to-memory">roughly 4 “slots</a>”) and whatever isn’t written down continues to occupy that space. At some point, you may find that this system won’t scale to the breadth or depth of tasks required of you. I found my solution in <em>Getting Things Done</em> with <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things3</a>, but there are other methodologies <a href="https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-getting-things-done-1551880955">outlined in this article</a> that may suit you better.</p>

<p>Managing your tasks is an excellent first step, but you may still experience information overload. Most knowledge workers (at least in software engineering) have an enormous quantity of material to read, reference, and recall at short notice. Few have a system to manage this. Tiago Forte’s <em><a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">PARA</a></em> shines here, as a flexible and useful system for managing hierarchies of reference material. Digital tools are the only prerequisite, and many are available, depending on your needs. <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, and <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> are great for general users. Academics may prefer <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> or <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>.</p>

<p>At this stage you may feel more in control. Great! You could stop here, but there is a final step, and it’s the most important. I mentioned that Tiago Forte uses the acronym <em><a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1142899542360297473">CODE</a></em> to describe the process of Collecting, Organising, Distilling, and Expressing what you read and reference. By now, you should be accomplishing the first two letters of that acronym. The remaining two, distilling and expressing, are important aspects of the <em><a href="https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect">Generation Effect</a>:</em> a phenomenon where active engagement with material leads to greater recall. If you want to understand what you read, you need to do something with it. That action is note-taking.</p>

<p>Taking notes can be as simple as ensuring you read with a pen and notebook to hand. I find this doesn’t scale very well though, and also doesn’t mirror how my mind works. I want networked thought, graphs of ideas, thoughts linking to other thoughts, and so do many others. Tools like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, and <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> resolve this as they represent literal graphs of thinking, allowing your ideas to cluster, link, and collide as unique insights. Choose a tool, and write about what you read in your own words. You may explore, create, and extrapolate in any way you wish. You may take a different approach to the next person, and that’s encouraged, as these tools should augment <em>your</em> thoughts. And that’s what they are: tools to aid your thoughts. Augmentations to help your brain make sense of the world.</p>

<p>What you end up developing, ultimately, is an idea machine, and a process to get the most from it. This starts from a place of “deep unknowing”, to a system which shows you the most unique and interesting intersections of your thoughts as geneses for new writing. The “daunting blank page” should never be blank again.</p>



<p>While exploring this rabbit hole, I learned that Personal Knowledge Managment (PKM) is a discrete area of study, rather than a new area of focus. Tiago Forte’s “<em>Second Brain</em>” had acted as an accessible entry point: a marketable tool for knowledge workers; but there is ample room for innovation beyond this approach. Andy Matuschak’s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">Evergreen notes</a> outline a new theory for this area, and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/">digital</a> <a href="https://www.notion.so/Rethinking-My-Thinking-e565d53ca7394314814b0fcf306dc0bf#a3fef6cac37c4a239458e739b66204e1">gardening</a> has become a very tactile metaphor for exploring ideas in public. There is an emerging “new wave” also, focused <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc">less on the act of note-taking</a>, and more on augmented thinking as the emergent frontier.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777">The Righteous Mind</a></em> by Jonathan Haidt explains the link between our conscious, calculating mind and our subconscious, instinctive mind with a metaphor: <em><a href="https://www.creativehuddle.co.uk/the-elephant-and-the-rider">The Elephant and the Rider</a></em>:</p>



<ul><li>The rider is our “conscious”, reasoning mind, which uses explainable logic to reason about the world, our own behavior, and our preferences&nbsp;</li><li>The elephant is the momentum of pre-trained and pre-wired preferences with which we make “snap” decisions about preferences or morality.</li></ul>



<p>The rider — <em>homo logicus</em> — believes itself to be in control of the elephant, but this is only about 10% true.&nbsp; In truth, when the rider and elephant disagree about which direction to ride, the elephant almost always wins. &nbsp; The rider instead spends time making excuses to justify why it really <em>intended</em> to go that direction all along!</p>



<p>Or, non-metaphorically: the vast majority of the time, we use our “thinking” mind to explain and generate justifications <em>for </em>our snap judgements — but our thinking mind only rarely is able to actually redirect our pre-trained biases into choices we <em>really don’t want </em>to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Occasionally, if it’s a topic we don’t have strong pre-trained preferences about (“What’s your opinion on the gold standard?”), the rider has control — but possibly only until the elephant catches a familiar scent (“The gold standard <em>frees</em> individuals from the <em>control</em> of governmental fiat”) and we fall back to pre-wired beliefs.</p>



<p>Most of the time, the rider (our thinking brain)’s job is to explain <em>why </em>the elephant is walking the direction it is — providing concrete explainable justifications for beliefs whose <em>real </em>foundation is genetic pre-wiring (“Why are spiders scary?”) or decades of imprinting (“Why is incest bad?”)</p>



<p>But even though the rider isn’t, strictly speaking, <em>in control,</em> it’s the glue which helped us level up from smart apes to quasi-hive organisms with cities, indoor plumbing, and senatorial filibusters.&nbsp; By nudging our elephants in <em>roughly</em> the right direction once in a while, we can build civilizations and only rarely atomize each other.</p>



<hr>



<p>Traditional visions of AI — and the AI still envisioned by popular culture —&nbsp; is cold, structured, logic incarnate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most early game AIs performed a minimax search when choosing a move, methodically evaluating the search space.&nbsp; The AI would calculate for each move how to counter the best possible move the opponent could make, and then would perform these calculations as deep as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#/media/File:Plminmax.gif">computing power permitted</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ud8kBw-1J-kflDLagogJfcjbvmWDZvug7RMZiu-RSZnyzCRwJNdk41gBvsWlSP8RjkzqQHP7-WnJ9tMVLqbgOtOyolxB0p67N1TnN6XMdE9UenqkC5tOsER1bnVSGpmbQXmQgm0c" alt=""></figure>



<p>This is still the AI portrayed in popular media.&nbsp; In a positive portrayal, the AI is precise, logical, and (somewhat) useful:</p>



<blockquote><p>C-3PO : Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1</p><p>Han Solo : Never tell me the odds.</p></blockquote>



<p>In a negative portrayal, AI is cold and calculating, but never pointlessly cruel.&nbsp; In <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, if HAL 9000 opened the pod bay doors, it would prove (in worst case) a potential risk to HAL 9000 (itself), and the mission.&nbsp; The rational move was to eliminate Dave.</p>



<blockquote><p>Bowman: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.</p><p>HAL 9000: I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.</p></blockquote>



<p>HAL 9000 was simply playing chess against Dave.</p>



<p>NLP and structured knowledge extraction operated similarly.&nbsp; NLP techniques&nbsp; were built to turn sentences into query-able knowledge bases via structured information extraction.&nbsp; Facts were extracted from natural-language sentences and stored in <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.html">knowledge bases</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OrUt92J_TuAMdpIwV0YPFVwJ63ILJBu-O1jL5sFmPjr0NE9Scb4lolprW_dVt_gABmBB71E85Wegjk1A4bCF8NlS9VT-xOmwZvajEeTTf9o5_u5NDOzHAEBmSTQsg-J4FmVl7ISJ" alt=""></figure>



<p>Decisions made by AI systems which used information extraction techniques were fully explainable, because they were built from explicit extracted facts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These visions of AI all envisioned artificial agents as the elephant <em>riders</em>, in which decisions were made upon cold facts.&nbsp; Perhaps we first tried to build explainable AI because we preferred to see <em>ourselves </em>as the riders — a strictly logical agent in firm control of our legacy animal instincts.</p>



<hr>



<p>But modern AI is the elephant.</p>



<p>Neural networks have replaced traditional structured AI in almost every real application — in both academia and industry.&nbsp; These networks are fast, effective, dynamic, easy to train (for enough money), and <em>completely unexplainable.</em></p>



<p>Neural networks imitate animal cognition by modeling computation as layers of connected neurons, each neuron connected to downstream neurons with varying strength:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2lh5kehxTJGR_nn_wxlFEIBFDigu6Jss7NzCvGHFJ17W_V2R3D_lJxqGDaztJ729GxlRK1bdaWmAxBBP53R5KHEpGKEsBTKz0X3R2o_tX3M-hW6GVFxvRYHPnV-DIu9wnfNt9gWy" alt=""></figure>



<p>There’s a huge amount of active research into how to design more effective neural networks, how to most efficiently train neural networks, and how to build hardware which most effectively simulates neural networks (for example, Google’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu">Tensor Processor Units</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But none of this research changes the fact that neural networks are (perhaps by design) <em>not explainable — </em>training produces networks which are able to answer questions quickly and often correctly, but the trained network is just a mathematical array of weighted vectors which cannot be meaningfully translated into human language for inspection.&nbsp; The only way to evaluate the AI is to see what it does.</p>



<p>This is the elephant.&nbsp; And it is wildly effective.</p>



<hr>



<p><a href="https://news.developer.nvidia.com/openai-presents-gpt-3-a-175-billion-parameters-language-model/">GPT-3</a> is the world’s most advanced neural network (developed by the OpenAI consortium), and an API backed by GPT-3 was soft-released over the past couple weeks to high-profile beta users. &nbsp; GPT-3 is a neural network with 175 billion trained parameters (by far the world’s largest publicly documented neural network).&nbsp; It was trained on a wide range of internet-available text sources.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is a predictive model — that is, provide it the first part of a block of text, and it will generate the text which it predicts should come next.&nbsp; The simplest application of text prediction is writing stories, which GPT-3 <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-3-experiments/blob/master/examples/unicorn/output_0_7.md">excels at</a> (the prompt is in <strong>bold,</strong> generated text below):</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7H0XZMG_DF8YBEcPxElNs0CSIc6DCDyfw4dwNrSkSBKTXa53f2HeG1f3RQ3pQA71taUyjiuNg8mPvv2e6k1qINrZEF9GLz9T8FeCplKx00RiSALQzrDiuK-6O-wCF9IOLEeX5w0v" alt=""></figure>



<p>But text prediction is equally applicable to everyday conversation.&nbsp; GPT-3 can, with prompting, answer <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497/photo/1">everyday questions</a>, and even identify when questions are nonsensical (generated answers at the bottom):</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RKblkR2q12adL6nIo-VRCYb5FLaQX5J9gd7YAaXy9si8wULHYpt0FngcptgQ2gJrqe_jVCEMlM_NNjLi97az98WyFJgOfnLWGMPxHsUf0Z_qsvbTnbd3EXihOJ00494uNraXmxRZ" alt=""></figure>



<p>Gwern has <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3">generated</a> GPT-3 responses on a wide range of prompts, categorizing where it does well and where it does poorly.&nbsp; Not every response is impressive, but many are, and the conclusion is that GPT-3 is a huge leap forward from GPT-2 (which used 1.5B parameters, vs GPT-3’s 175B).</p>



<hr>



<p>GPT-2 and GPT-3 have no model of the world, but that doesn’t stop them from having opinions when prompted.</p>



<p>GPT-2/3 are trained on the internet, and are thus the aggregated voice of anyone who has written an opinion on the internet.&nbsp; So they are very <em>good </em>at quickly generating judgements and opinions, even though they have absolutely no logical or moral framework backing those judgements.</p>



<p>Huggingface provides a <a href="https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large">publicly-accessible playground</a> to test GPT-2’s predictions on your own text inputs (GPT-3 is, for now, available only to internet celebrities and VCs).&nbsp; We can prompt GPT-2 for opinions on a variety of emotionally charged topics, like incest:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KUWi965-5Ky7aPo5uLju8SIU-VdGobIBfiUyRg19sSG09EXvWS_ShM8a0Lg0bZ5ngJu6Q_-RBkEmF0_74o3jYzYg2kMjLehS_UYJxyPHPFfmKov-Ey-LjfNdL99A2-9Z07rJy-hx" alt=""></figure>



<p>abortion:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Nj_tUgUrfk_tamMZOmUkWTOoCXhG23c7JBKU-gysCGG6DoTiVmk6A2lJTO__oRpyz1pbQ6Vy4SVVI-HJk9aiA3lGyAJ9LmB6tHZQ-bN48uIxkSqvFnK1XTT6d8oPLqMiNPOH48rX" alt=""></figure>



<p>and other topics likely to provoke an emotional response:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mo2gIlBIni5ZmF3JRGOLhcD3IG-GDn6WXnZtoGtXWfFXzN8Pw_QpqrCTopzQj0kltiukuq30r0_L6-1m6_Cna2kSvHsZzasvcw5FmLYmlEMuDf0chDwRKbRJBt3jNrsIW0Bjyaro" alt=""></figure>



<p>These are elephant responses, generated by volume of training data, not clever logical deduction .&nbsp; GPT-* has absolutely no model of the world or moral framework by which it generates logical responses — and yet the responses read as plausibly human.  </p>



<p>Because, after all, <em>we </em>are 90% elephant.  </p>



<hr>



<p>What does this mean for AI, and for us?</p>



<p>Most people have no idea what modern AI <em>is</em>, and that makes effective oversight of AI research by the public completely impossible.&nbsp; Media depictions of AI have only shown two plausible futures:</p>



<ul><li>Hyper-logical, explainable, “Friendly AI”: Data from <em>Star Trek</em>.&nbsp; Alien, but because of the <em>absence </em>of emotion</li><li>Hyper-logical, explainable, “Dangerous AI”: <em>Terminator</em>.&nbsp; Deadly, but for an explainable reason: the AI is eliminating a threat (us)</li></ul>



<p>These visions are so wildly far from the future we are in, that the public is less informed for having been shown them&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AIs we’ll <em>actually</em> interact with tomorrow — on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, or a MMORPG —&nbsp; are utterly un-logical.&nbsp; They are the pure distilled emotions of anyone who has ever voiced their opinions on the internet, amplified a thousandfold (and perhaps filtered for anger or love for <em>particular </em>targets, like China, Russia, or Haribo Gummy Bears).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we want the public to have any informed opinion about what, how, and where AI is deployed (and as GPT-3/4/5 seem poised to obviate <em>all creative writing</em>, among other careers, this seems like a reasonable ask), the first step is to stop showing them an inaccurate picture of what Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have actually built.</p>



<p>And second: if we <em>do </em>want to ever get the AI we saw in <em>Star Trek</em> (but hopefully not <em>Terminator</em>), we need to actually build a model-based, logical elephant <em>rider</em>, and not just the elephant itself — even though it’s <em>much, much, harder</em> than downloading 20 billion tweets of training data and throwing them at a trillion parameter neural network.</p>



<p>Or maybe we should figure out how to do it ourselves, first. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><blockquote>
<p>The <code>Expert</code> in anything was once a <code>Beginner</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I had a chance to  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.com/post/where-to-begin-ckcola56d0034s0s1goh56ua4/answer/ckcprkctw00fq9ss1boil9o7c">respond to the HashNode  discussion thread</a> asking, <em>Where to begin</em>? The question and my response to it was around a specific context but, after thinking more about it, I got the idea of expanding it as a blog article.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the word <code>beginner</code> is underrated. We use this term loosely and allow others to use it without realizing the true power behind it. This blog post is about my views of where to begin and the fun of being a beginner.</p>
<p>I am sure, you will be able to relate to it. It will be great to hear from your experiences as well. Please share your thoughts, learning, experiences as comments below.</p>

<p>We all are born as beginners. From a toddler to kid to teenager to an adult, a beginner's journey is about learning, improving, persisting and again loop the cycle for a new beginning. Believe me, we will be doing just the same for the entire life!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595142482429/Y8SwXwNfd.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Beginnercycle.png"></p>
<p>Exactly the same philosophy applies to the skill development, coding, programming, our creative work, whatever we take up next. All of the four stages are equally important for us to get transitioned from a beginner to an expert or master.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Begin:</code> Start of the journey.</li>
<li><code>Learn:</code> Being in the journey and discovering the end of it. </li>
<li><code>Improve:</code> Knowing the struggle and challenges of the past to ensure a better future of the journey.</li>
<li><code>Persist:</code> The ability to stay firm, focused, confident and try completing an enjoyable journey.</li>
</ul>

<p>A famous quote by Barbara Sher,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can learn new things at any time in your life if you're willing to be a beginner. If you actually learn to like being a beginner, the whole world opens up to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a beginner, the question of <em>where to begin</em> is very common. However finding the right answer may depend on various factors like,</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I beginning with?</li>
<li>Why am I doing this?</li>
<li>What's my end goal?</li>
<li>Is there a reference(or experience) to follow when I begin?</li>
<li>What if I fail?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-begin-with-the-end-in-mind">☑️ Begin with the end in mind</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161532368/gd3Hj3q8x.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="goal.gif"></p>
<p>This is about knowing the end goal at the beginning of the journey. Say, You want to learn reactjs and you do not have much ideas about it yet. That's fine but, you should have fair idea of why do you want to learn reactjs? What are you going to do with it? Is it going to help getting you the next cool job? or Is it for fun learning? certification etc?</p>
<p>Time is precious and invaluable and we must make a good use of it. There must be reasons of beginning something. Also beginning with the end in mind gives you enough planning opportunities to make your learning productive and fruitful.</p>
<h2 id="-motivation-is-important">☑️ Motivation is important</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161079335/3UPbGShgN.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="motivation.gif"></p>
<p>You have began. How are you doing? It is hard to continue without a motivation. Some of us are self motivated. Many of us need an external motivation factor. A motivation to begin something always helps us in completing the journey with positive outcome.</p>
<p>At present, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.com/n/2articles1week">#2articles1week</a> challenge motivates me to write articles for the technology community benefit. I began on the challenge with the motivation of writing at least 2 quality articles in a week and I am on it!</p>
<h2 id="-do-not-give-up">☑️ Do not give up</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161169170/bb2h4Yg20.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="hang_in.gif"></p>
<p>It is very easy to begin. It is equally challenging to hang on it without giving up. Most of the beginnings are not overnight things. It takes time. <code>Persistence</code> is the key here. </p>
<p>For example, let's take any skills. A skill takes time to learn, more time to be good at, much more time to be an expert or master.  Don't give up. Keep moving on.</p>
<h2 id="-follow-a-proven-path">☑️ Follow a proven path</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161474007/6c4BQNzfk.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="path.gif"></p>
<p>It is about learning from others and their experiences. One who has completed a journey or left in-between can help others guiding on similar path. Be an information seeker but, not necessarily you need to imitate.</p>
<p>For example, if you are beginning your journey to become a blogger, it makes sense to learn from the journey of other bloggers. How and where the journey began for them? What are the DOs and DON'Ts they have followed? You can always improvise on top of that to make it your own.</p>
<h2 id="-you-are-not-alone">☑️ You are not alone</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161923820/ZmUuwkjK-.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="together.gif"></p>
<p>When you feel challenged, struggling with things to make it work, do not feel that the situation is unique to you. You are really not alone even when it seems so. Look around, ask for help.</p>
<p>Going back to the basics help many times in coming out of a challenging situation. Specially in the areas of skill development. Be part of  a community where you can learn and share. When it comes to the areas of skill development, no better support than a community to make you feel connected.</p>
<h2 id="-being-a-beginner-is-inevitable">☑️ Being a beginner is inevitable</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595162437794/8eIIBryYV.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="start.gif"></p>
<p>Yes, this is true! Once a beginner is always a beginner. How? Let me explain.</p>
<p>You began on something, learned it, improved on it and persisted too. Now you are a subject matter expert on it. Are you going to stop with that? No, right? The ever curious mind of yours will find something else, something new to begin. Thus you are a beginner again.</p>

<p>So where to begin? If you are waiting, begin now. Begin with the resources you have in hands. If unsure, ask for help. Once began, stay motivated and do not give up. Good to have inspirations but, work towards making your own mark.</p>
<p>It is not just about where to begin, it is also about how to proceed, what to do and when to end. I would like to conclude this article with another famous motivational quote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never forget that, even the best was once a beginner. Don't be afraid to take that first step to greatness.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/title.png" alt="Number of Parameters of GPT-3 compared to previous models.

<p><span>The sheer scale of the new GPT-3 model</span> is hard to overstate; it’s an entire <em>order of magnitude</em> larger than Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already-massive 17B parameter Turing-NLG</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Loading the entire model’s weights in fp16 would take up an absolutely preposterous 300GB of VRAM, not even including the gradients. But, with massive size comes massive generalization ability: GPT-3 is competitive in many benchmarks <em>without even tuning on the target task</em>. And when I say many, I mean <em>many</em>—the full, 72-page paper contains an extensive evaluation of GPT-3 on many NLP datasets. Through the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI API</a>, a vast array of impressive demos have sprung up taking advantage of the generalization capabilities of GPT-3 to do extremely disparate tasks. Perhaps the most impressive part, though, is that even at such a massive scale, the model still scales smoothly in performance instead of plateauing, implying that still-larger models would perform <em>even better</em>. Throughout the rest of this post, my goal is to distill this massive (in multiple ways) paper down to a digestible size, and shed some light on why it matters.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes some of the largest autoregressive Transformer models of the past few years. I’ve excluded models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XLNet</a> and BERT-derivatives because they don’t have the same unidirectional autoregressive training target.</p>

<p>While GPT-3 isn’t that much deeper, its width is nearly <strong>3x</strong> that of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing-NLG</a>, which—since parameter count scales approximately proportional to the square of the hidden size—explains where most of the extra parameters come from. It also has double the context size, at 2048 tokens, which is impressive (and memory-expensive!), though not the biggest context size across all models; some models have even longer contexts, like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transformer-XL</a>, which incorporates longer contexts by passing context vectors between segments, and <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/reformer-efficient-transformer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reformer</a>, which uses locality-sensitive hashing to enable sparser attention. Similarly, GPT-3 uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparse attention layers</a> in every other layer, though the exact details are left somewhat ambiguous. It’s also interesting to note that the smaller GPT-3 versions trained for comparison with GPT-2 are slightly shallower and wider, with GPT-3-XL having only 24 layers but a hidden size of 2048.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> GPT-3 also reuses the BPE tokenization of GPT-2. Overall, GPT-3 is essentially just a downright massive version of GPT-2.</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/tdata.png" alt="Weighted Training Data (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The training data is a reweighted mix of Common Crawl, WebText2 (a larger version of the original that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also includes links sampled in the period of Jan-Oct 2018</a>), two book corpora, and English Wikipedia. Some of these components, such as Wikipedia, were seen more than 3 times during training; others, like the massive Common Crawl component, had less than half of their data seen. The authors claim that this is to help raise the overall quality of the corpus by prioritising known-good datasets. Also, in contrast to the original WebText, this new corpus is not filtered by language, but English still constitutes 93% of the dataset by words simply due to its prevalence. Altogether, the dataset is 500 billion tokens, or 700GB<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, after filtering and cleaning. The paper also provides a detailed description of the filtering process of the dataset, which the GPT-2 paper didn’t.</p>
<p>The authors also attempted to remove any data that overlapped with the train and test sets of the evaluations. Unfortunately, due to a bug, some were missed, so to compensate the paper provides a fairly good analysis of the impact of this leakage.</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf-small.png" alt="Zero-, One-, and Few-shot performance of GPT-3 scaling with parameter count (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The Evaluation section of GPT-3 is very comprehensive, evaluating on a massive battery of NLP tasks in the Zero-shot (given only a natural language description in the generation context), One-shot (a single example in the generation context), or Few-shot (a small handful of examples in the generation context) settings. This setting is worth emphasizing as perhaps one of the biggest differences in ability between GPT-2 and its predecessors, because being able to <em>infer the task</em> from just one or a few examples is a massive step forward in generalization. Whereas previous models all relied on task-specific tuning, GPT-3 can be “tuned” merely by giving it instructions <em>in plain English</em>! In fact, the paper doesn’t even attempt to fine-tune on the target task, leaving that to future work.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> However, one crucial conclusion is that in almost all tests, performance continues to get better with larger models, even across 4 entire orders of magnitude, whereas fine-tuning only improves on one task and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11373.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks catastrophic forgetting and overfitting</a>.</p>
<p>Without going too much into the individual tests, the general result is this: on most tasks, GPT-3 achieves performance significantly worse than fine-tuned SOTA (i.e SuperGLUE, CoQA, Winograd, to name a few), but beating fine-tuned SOTA for some other tasks (i.e PhysicalQA, LAMBADA, Penn Tree Bank). GPT-3 does particularly well on PTB in particular, taking the SOTA perplexity from 35.76 down to 20.5—a massive improvement. GPT-3 can also finally do some arithmetic, something GPT-2 was unable to do well.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/newsgen-small.png" alt="People are unable to separate GPT-3 generated news articles from real ones (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Impressively, and perhaps somewhat alarmingly, people are unable to distinguish GPT-3 generated news stories from real ones, only exacerbating the ethical concerns already raised by GPT-2. The paper analyzes the result of the release of GPT-2, and concludes that the release of GPT-2 has not led to widespread use of LMs for misinformation due to the difficulty of controlling output and variance in output quality, both among low-to-mid skill adversaries and “advanced persistent threats”—adversaries with “high skill and long-term agendas”—such as state actors. However, the paper also acknowledges that with further development, LMs will eventually become advanced enough for these adversaries.</p>
<p>The authors also investigate gender bias in GPT-3, showing that GPT-3 is male leaning; however, the authors claim that some preliminary evidence on the Winogender dataset (which tests coreference resolution on the same sentence but with different gendered pronoun) seems to suggest that larger models are more robust to bias issues. Similar issues appeared for race and religion, with the sentiment of coöccurrent terms varying significantly with race. The authors claim that this issue also got better with the larger models—although, without proper hypothesis testing, it’s difficult to draw any solid conclusions here.</p>

<p>GPT-3 has already been used for a smorgasbord of different applications through the OpenAI API. You can ask it to <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hturan/status/1282261783147958272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code</a>, turn <a href="http://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language commands into shell commands</a>, and simulate <a href="https://www.aiwriter.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatting with famous people</a>. You can ask it to <a href="https://twitter.com/QasimMunye/status/1278750809094750211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answer medical questions</a>, or <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#navy-seal-copypasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write parodies of the navy seal copypasta</a>. You can ask it to <a href="https://andrewmayneblog.wordpress.com/2020/06/13/openai-api-alchemy-summarization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summarize passages for second graders</a>, or <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#transformer-poetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write poetry</a>.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember all these are done by the <em>exact same model</em> trained <em>only</em> on modelling text; all that’s different is that it has been “asked nicely” to do different things. These apps showcase the versatility of GPT-3 across many disparate domains—something that, if it were done with GPT-2, would require days or even weeks of extensive data engineering and fine tuning, rather than 15 minutes of prompt crafting. This new paradigm of programming through crafting plain-English prompts, jokingly dubbed <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1273788774422441984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Software 3.0”</a>, has achieved results that are already impressive, but even more impressive when viewed through the lens of <strong>generalization</strong>; GPT-3 wasn’t trained to do any of these things in particular, but it could still be asked<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> to do them, and fairly well at that!</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Performance continues to scale with compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>But why does GPT-3 matter, if it can’t even beat SOTA across all benchmarks? Why should we care about a model so large that a small computing cluster is necessary even just to run inference at a reasonable speed?</p>
<p>One thing about GPT-3 is that it’s doing reasonably well on tasks it has <em>never even seen</em>, and sometimes tasks not even anticipated by the developers of the model. Additionally, instead of reaching a point of diminishing returns, GPT-3 shows that the trend of larger models performing better continues for at least another order of magnitude, with no signs of stopping. Even though GPT-3 is unwieldy, and even though it still doesn’t quite reach human level performance across the board, GPT-3 shows that it’s <em>possible</em> for a model to someday reach human levels of generalization in NLP—and once the impossible becomes possible, it’s only a matter of time until it becomes practical.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Back when I talked about <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">large Transformer language models like GPT-2, CTRL, and Megatron-LM late last year</a>, I touched briefly on the trend of Language Models getting bigger, and covered some of the issues that simply more compute might not fix. My general anticipation was that the model size arms race would soon be at a temporary standstill, with focus being diverted to better decoding strategies for text generation (perhaps via RL-based methods). I most certainly had not expected that OpenAI would be back at it so soon with such a massive model.</p>
<p>This was such a surprise that I dropped everything to read the paper and work on this post, including a more theory-oriented post that I’ve been working on for a few months now. It will probably be finished <span>soon™</span>, after I recover from GPT-3 shock. Stay tuned! <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2"><p>It’s likely that this was done for easier model parallelism—bigger matrix multiplications are much easier to parallelize than sequentially-applied layers à la <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPipe</a>.</p>
<p>This could have other advantages too, though. After <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EfficientNet</a> came out, I independently ran some experiments of the same concepts to Transformer models, and the result was that for the same amount of compute, wider models had a sizeable advantage over deeper ones—which corroborates the choice here to …</p></li></ol></section></div></div>

		<p>Picking your next professional endeavor ain't easy. There's plenty of advice regarding that on the Internet. Usually, this topic is covered from junior's perspective - how to choose your first job, what to avoid, what kind of questions to ask first, etc. But in fact, it appears that seasoned veterans have similars dilemmas - once in a while some old acquaintance asks me for help in determining the next professional career step:</p><ul><li>which companies (in the area) are worth of interest?</li><li>who offers enough of a challenge so that one could fulfill her/his ambitions?</li><li>where could one elevate her/his game, instead of regressing the skillset?</li></ul><p>Obviously - there's no single answer that would fit everyone. It depends on one's motivations, preferred collaboration model, ambition level, even personal ethics. Nevertheless, I've merged all those questions for the sake of providing the most valuable advice:</p><blockquote>Of all companies (/teams) I've worked for in the last couple of years, which collaborations brought me most satisfaction, fulfillment &amp; ... fun? And what's more important: what was <strong>the single factor</strong> this joint positive impression was mostly dependent on?</blockquote><p>The answer (a single word) may sound surprising, but it came up naturally. Few months ago, I noticed I keep using this word more and more in my daily conversations.</p><p>This word is ...</p><p>Huh? But what do I mean by "clarity"? A "clarity" of what?</p><p>Let's call it <strong>a clarity of "work context"</strong>.</p><p>Which means a joint clarity ...</p><ul><li>... of vision (to follow, aka a strategic perspective)</li><li>... of goals (to achieve) / or problems (to beat, aka a tactical perspective)</li><li>... and of what I'm going to do tomorrow (to have things progressing, aka operational perspective).</li></ul><p>Just to be clear: when I mention "goals", it's NOT just about having some goals listed on a scrap of paper. It's about truly <strong>understanding &amp; embracing</strong> them, so even if (at this point in time) you don't know how to achieve them, you at least have the clarity of how/where to start.</p><p>What happens when ...</p><p><br>People drift. Focus gets lost. Positive energy gets wasted. Chaos lurks underneath. We shift from being paid for meaningful results (because we don't understand/foresee those results) to being paid for "time spent in work" - which is a real motivation &amp; ownership killer.</p><p>In fact, clarity appears to be (in practice) fair compensation for various inconveniences - like dealing with an outdated tech stack or organizational debt (of any kind).</p><p>What could cause clarity to get lost? Lack of transparency (e.g., failing to shape a big picture accessible for everyone), miss-communications, neo-feudal hierarchies (and other kinds of knowledge/control siloes), diverging, inconsistent or too unstable priorities, lack of internal focus &amp; delivery discipline (e.g., shitty prioritization), poor value management (everything is critical!), micro-management with a pathological lack of trust, ... and so it goes.</p><p><br>Paradoxically, these days it isn't easy to find a company w/o a written vision, mission statement or striking strategic goals. Unfortunately, they are usually very poorly defined. Take "digital transformation", which appears in every 2nd company's nearest plans - it's so vague and ambiguous that it practically means NOTHING. Who would die for it? Who would get motivated by "digitally transforming"? To be frank, such statements typically ... reduce the clarity, instead of improving it.</p><p>I strongly believe in individuals taking ownership and being able to make a difference - the initiative can come from anywhere, either from the "bottom" or the "top". However, when it comes to clarity in particular, I find it as majorly leaders' responsibility. It's a part of their professional credibility. What we expect of a leader is:</p><ul><li>to understand where we are</li><li>to know where we're heading</li><li>to have (a visible) confidence we can get there</li><li>to convince everyone else it's feasible and within reach</li></ul><p>There's no excuse - someone w/o clarity AND the ability to "infect" others with that clarity simply can't be a credible leader.</p>

<p>Everywhere I’ve worked, there’s a hidden (and sometimes not-so-hidden) expectation that code constantly get pushed out. Code not being pushed is a red flag. Make sure you take no longer than a week for a Jira ticket or a Github issue. Have you been taking longer than a week? Expect to get pinged on Slack:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>your-friendly-project-manager</strong>: Hey, how’s it going with ABCD-123, need any help?
</p></blockquote>
<p>And, I get it: that’s the PM’s job. But I’m also trying to do <em>my</em> job: not just writing code, but writing <em>good</em> code.</p>
<h2>An AGILE Trojan horse</h2>
<p>If you bring up evaluating programmers based lines-of-code these days, most people agree it’s archaic and ineffective, but lines of code are back, you see: it’s called <em>velocity</em>. “Are you happy with your velocity?” an engineering lead might ask you. “We should work on our velocity…” a product manager might balk.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/velocity.png" alt="Are you happy with your velocity?" width="482" height="401" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/velocity.png 482w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/velocity-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"></p><p>Velocity is another (more polite and trendy) way of essentially evaluating programmers on how much code they write. And this has all the implications you might imagine. “Velocity,” <a href="https://www.scruminc.com/velocity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Scrum Inc.</a>, is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a Team can tackle during a single Sprint and is the key metric in Scrum. Velocity is calculated at the end of the Sprint by totaling the Points for all fully completed User Stories. […] Velocity is a key feedback mechanism for the Team. It helps them measure whether process changes they make are improving their productivity or hurting it. While a Team’s velocity will oscillate from Sprint to Sprint, over time, a well-functioning Scrum Team’s velocity should steadily trend upward by roughly 10% each Sprint.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can ignore the downright ridiculous idea that efficiency should trend +10% <em>ad infinitum</em>, but level of effort (and therefore the point mechanism) will often involve how much code — and implicitly how difficult — a particular feature might be. What velocity ignores is one key element of writing good code and building good products: <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<h2>Using your brain</h2>
<p>A lot of times, thinking about <em>how</em> to build something is harder and more time consuming than actually building it. This might seem like unnecessary meta-cognition, but it’s not: even before writing a paper, you might need to write up an outline. An outline might turn into a rough draft. After a few edits, the draft turns into the final product. Software is very similar, but that’s not how we build it.</p>
<p>Instead, we build features that are stuck to other features using duct tape and superglue. Sometimes, we have fancy names for shoddy software: we’re building <em>microservices</em>, guy! No one has time for refactoring or cleanup. Unit testing? We’ll throw those in the backlog; they’re not high priority. Inevitably something breaks, a customer complains, and we’re off to the races: who’s on call this week? Good luck.</p>
<p>After more than a decade working at software companies, I’ll be the first to admit that I’m part of the problem. I don’t push back anymore, and I’ve conceded more times that I can count. I <em>know</em> we’re building bad software, but everyone else is doing it, too.</p>
<h2>How much is too much?</h2>
<p>Why is this happening? It’s just too much darn code. Too much code to read over, too much code to review, too many pull requests. It takes <em>time</em> to mull over questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this the best way to do this?</li>
<li>What are the trade-offs between doing it this way or that way?</li>
<li>Should we re-architect part of the code to accommodate this new feature?</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, these questions tend to wax creative, and not technical. But I’ve never seen a Jira ticket entitled “Ponder over proposed architecture” or “Think about better ways one might implement this.” Do the tests look like they’re passing? LGTM, merging ✔️</p>
<p>Don’t just write code quickly; write code <em>well</em>. And please stop writing so much of it.</p>

July 19, 2020 | https://vectorly.io/docs/technology/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vectorly.io/docs/technology/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">

<p><img src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/vector-graphics.png" alt="Drawing"></p>

<p>Vectorly is developing a new kind of video compression technology, which uses computer vision and vector graphics to reduce bitrates for video content by an order of magnitude (or more) compared to HEVC, while <strong>improving video</strong> quality. </p>
<p>This would be primarily effective for "vector friendly" video content, which would include animations, screen-casts, many e-learning videos and potentially 3d gaming content. </p>
<p>By leveraging existing vector-graphics rendering capabilities on all devices, this codec wouldn't require end-users, OEMs or browsers to install special software to enable playback of these videos.</p>
<p><strong>We are still in the early phases of developing this technology</strong>.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the technology in our <a href="https://files.vectorly.io/Vectorization+Whitepaper+v06.20.pdf">whitepaper</a></p>
<h2 id="the-core-idea">The Core Idea</h2>
<p>The core insight behind this project was that you could use vector-graphics based animations to simulate "videos" in a way that is indistinguishable from a traditional raster-graphics based video format such as an h264 video stream in an MP4 container.</p>
<h3 id="raster-graphics">Raster Graphics</h3>
<p>Normal videos, like the ones you see on Netflix or YouTube, are just sequences of images which get updated quickly on the screen, to create the illusion of motion. Each image is composed of "pixels" - individual dots of color. Higher resolution means more pixels, better visual quality, and bigger file sizes.</p>
<p><img alt="Pixel-Based" src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/pixels.png"></p>
<p>Almost all video on the internet is of this format, known as "raster graphics". Video compression algorithms like h264 are just very efficient at using fewer data-points to reconstruct the pixels in any given frame, and at storing only the differences in pixels between frames of a video. </p>
<h3 id="vector-grapics-video">Vector Grapics video</h3>
<p>In contrast, we use a concept called "vector-graphics" to render video. Instead of pixels, we represent everything on the screen using shapes, lines and curves, which can be represented as mathematical equations (vector graphics).</p>
<p><img alt="Vector-Based" src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/vector2.png"></p>
<p>Using these mathematical equations, we can re-draw any arbitrary shape on the screen - from the letter "T" to Bart Simpson's head. Furthermore, by adding information such as color, position on the screen, and how they move or change shape over time, you can create whole videos - including entire episodes of the Simpsons, with just sequences of mathematical equations.</p>
<h3 id="why-vectorization">Why vectorization?</h3>
<p>The core insight behind this project was that for a certain kind of "vector-friendly" video content, storing the video using vector graphics would be much more efficient than using raster graphics (in some cases, up to 2 orders of magnitude more efficient).</p>
<p>This idea is not substantively different from the idea of Flash based animations about 20 years ago. Why do this now?</p>
<p><strong>No need for a decoder</strong>: Most devices now support SVG, HTML5, WebGL/OpenGL and/or some form of hardware-accelerated vector-graphics rendering. That lets you render vector-graphics content on any device without require end-users, OEMs or browsers to install special software to enable playback of vector-graphics content, and to achieve native-level performance by doing so. App developers would only need to include an appropriate library or SDK in their website or app to enable playback within native or 3rd player video players.</p>
<p><strong>Computer vision</strong>: Our patented vectorization technology relies heavily on computer vision to convert raster-graphics videos to a vector format. Leveraging the advancement &amp; commoditization of Computer Vision, and the ease of running batch computer-vision heavy tasks on the cloud, it's feasible to 'vectorize' large volumes of video at scale now, in a way that wasn't possible even 5 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="vector-graphics-video-format">Vector graphics video format</h3>
<p>We are building a video-format based on existing standards (SVG, WebGL &amp; OpenGL), extending it with Javascript to enable video features such as a timeline and key-frames. We package the resulting video data within an MP4 container, which can be streamed and distributed using existing video infrastructure (such as HLS/DASH, and DRM systems).</p>

            <p><code>Utah, US</code></p>
<p>This week, we moved out of Provo to Park City for a short vacation.
Park City is cool.
It’s a skiing city for tourists, and we expected there would be few people in summer.
But we actually saw many people there for biking –
there are a lot of trails among those mountains.</p>
<h2 id="bigannouncementeth-hacks">BigAnnouncement.eth hacks</h2>
<p>Our HackFS project, <a href="https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement/">The Big Announcement</a>, went well according to our <code>MVP Roadmap</code>,
though the journey wasn’t that smooth. The experience of building on Ethereum has been frustrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of docs but few tutorials. I didn’t know where to start with the first line of code after reading the <code>Getting Started</code> docs.</li>
<li>The docs are often incomplete. Writers seem to expect prior knowledge of npm from readers, which I don’t have.</li>
<li>IPFS JavaScript code changes often, so things that worked two days ago do not work now. We spent too much time debugging API breakage.</li>
<li>js-ipfs doesn’t have a release page at all. We needed to build from source code to ensure we use a stable version, since an update to the CDN version broke our code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, HackFS hackers helped us a lot. We had a Zoom meeting with Carson from Textile, and he provided suggestions for our project.
He asked questions about our dev stack, skills, and project requirements first, and ultimately suggested not using their service because our project is so simple.
I respect that a lot.</p>
<p>I asked questions in the HackFS Slack channel too, and I got useful comments from other hackers.
I wrote, copied &amp; pasted some JavaScript and Solidity code
– they are strange languages, and I am not that into them.</p>
<p>At last, we succeeded at running an IPFS node in the browser and saved messages to IPFS with a self-built js-ipfs.
More details at the <a href="https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement/blob/master/doc/hacklog.md">hacklog</a>.</p>
<p>Building a dapp isn’t fun compared to building non-blockchain products.
The blockchain developer tooling is far from mature.
So far, it’s hard to enjoy the journey or feel motivated when programming the <code>decentralized web</code> dream.</p>
<p>I don’t see any blockchain platform succeeding without a smoother developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain-and-ethereum">Blockchain and Ethereum</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that Ethereum dominates and will keep its key position in the blockchain industry for a long while.</p>
<p>Other L1 blockchains need to interop with Ethereum just to stay relavent.
Only then might their innovations even matter. Ameen <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1284916104331063297">tweeted</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this how Eth becomes the default “interoperability” chain.
Every L1 will simply build a bridge to Eth, making it the default interop chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the community side,
even though people complain about the Eth2.0 development delay,
the Ethereum community continue to feel confident about the platform –
I consider it as a sign of a healthy community.</p>
<p>I am glad to see an inclusive community that accepts different, and sometimes conflicting, voices.
More importantly, Ethereum attracts great developers as well as newbies –
me as the latter, for instance.</p>
<h2 id="china-1984">China 1984</h2>
<p>A guy was arrested for writing an article about two dairy companies,
Mengniu(蒙牛) and Yili(伊利), manipulating China’s dairy industry standards.
He then claimed he was pressured to delete the article on WeChat’s publishing platform,
but he refused to do so.
However, we can’t read it now because the article has been deleted.</p>
<p>A student who wrote about the same topic also received warnings.
He later posted concerns about his safety.
Might he be arrested too?</p>
<p>Other articles published on this subject continue to be deleted.</p>
<p>I suspect that many mainland citizens may not read those articles,
and may not know that <strong>China has some of the worst dairy standards in the world</strong>.
There is a saying that it’s better to drink water than Chinese milk.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/1984-George-Orwell-ebook/dp/B088RKKYCC/"><strong>1984</strong></a> again – you will understand China by reading this book.
All successful Chinese internet companies cooperate and share data with the government in order to shape society.</p>
<p>More than one of my non-Chinese friends are curious that <strong>1984</strong> can be officially published and distributed in China.
One Chinese friend suggested this is because most Chinese don’t read nowadays.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>In praise of ZFS On Linux's ZED 'ZFS Event Daemon'</h2>

	<p><small>July 19, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've written before (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSameness">here</a>) about how <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSetupIII">our
current Linux ZFS fileservers</a> work much
like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSFileserverSetupII">our old OmniOS fileservers</a>.
However, not everything is quite the same between ZFS on Linux and
traditional Solaris/OmniOS ZFS. One of the most welcome differences
for us is <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.4/man8/zed.8.html">ZED</a>,
the ZFS Event Daemon. What ZED does that is so great is that it provides
a very simple way to take action when <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.4/man5/zfs-events.5.html">ZFS events</a> happen.</p>

<p>When a ZFS event happens, ZED looks through a directory (generally
<code>/etc/zfs/zed.d</code>) to find scripts (or programs) that should be run
in response to the event. Each script is run with a bunch of
environment variables set to describe what's going on, and it can
use those environment variables to figure out what the event is.
ZED decides what things to run based on their names; generally you
wind up with script names like <code>all-cslab.sh</code> (which is run on
all events) and <code>resilver_finish-cslab.sh</code> (which is run when a
resilver finishes).</p>

<p>Because these are just a collection of individual files, you're
free to add your own without colliding with or having to alter the
standard 'ZEDLETs' provided by ZFS on Linux. Your additions can do
anything you want them to, ranging from the simple to the complex.
For instance, our simplest ZEDLET simply syslogs all of the ZED
environment variables:</p>


<blockquote><pre>PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:$PATH
export PATH
if [ "$ZEVENT_SUBCLASS" = "history_event" ]; then
        exit 0
fi
unset ZEVENT_TIME
unset ZEVENT_TIME_STRING
printenv | fgrep 'ZEVENT_' | sort | fmt -999 |
    logger -p daemon.info -t 'cslab-zevents'
exit 0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(There's a standard 'all-syslog.sh' ZEDLET, but it doesn't syslog
all of the information in the zevents. Capturing all of the information
is especially useful if you want to write additional ZEDLETs and
aren't quite sure what they should look for or what environment
variables have useful information.)</p>

<p>It can take a bit of time and experimentation to sort out what ZFS
events are generated (and with what information available) in
response to various things happening to adn in your ZFS pools. But
once you have figured it out, ZED gives you a way to trigger and
drive all sorts of system management activities. These can be active
(like taking action if devices fail) or passive (like adding markers
in your metrics system or performance dashboards for when ZFS scrubs
or resilvers start and end, so you can correlate this with other
things happening).</p>

<p>Coming from Solaris and OmniOS, where there was no such simple
system for reacting to things happening in your ZFS pools, ZED was
a breath of fresh air for us. More than anything else, it feels
like how ZFS events should have been handled from the start, so
that system administrators could flexibly meet their own local needs
rather than having to accept whatever the Solaris Fault Management
system wanted to give them.</p>

<p>PS: Because ZFS on Linux is now OpenZFS, I believe that ZED will
probably eventually show up in FreeBSD (if it isn't already there).
Perhaps it will even some day be ported back to Illumos.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1998 at my first job, I was the system administrator of the biggest Internet provider in Bolivia, it still is the biggest provider. The Internet arrived here in 1995 or 1996, so it was just starting.</p>

<p>I was in charge of BGP routers, with a satellite connection to the Internet, the whole country had just 2 mbps of connection back in those days. I was also in charge of the email server, (roble.scz.entelnet.bo), the DNS server run on a Unix machine while the email and web server on a RedHat Linux powered PC.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2001, I started my own company, it had nothing to do with system administration, but anyway we needed email service, so I just got an on-line channel with a /28 public IP segment, and setup a CentOS server running bind, sendmail, Dovecot.</p>

<p>In 2007, I started blogging on Drupal running on that same server using Apache, PHP and MySQL <a href="https://www.garron.me/en/go2linux/fedora-centos-root-password-recovery.html">here the first post</a>. I was used to host services.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>But then I had less time in my hands, it was also more difficult to maintain the services running, keeping up to date with Spam filters and rules became difficult, Bind also had its problems, and Slashdot happened and Bandwidth was not enough.</p>

<p>I moved my server to a web hosting company, and then to a Linode VPS, I also outsourced the DNS service and moved the email to Google Apps.</p>

<p>I migrated my old server to Debian and used it just for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DHCP</li>
  <li>NAT</li>
  <li>DNS Cache</li>
  <li>Squid</li>
</ul>

<p>That was in 2010 more or less, so I stopped hosting my services, only my blog was in my hands, but at that time I started using Jekyll, so it was just a VPS with Nginx.</p>

<h2 id="back-on-hosting-my-own-services">Back on Hosting my own services</h2>

<p>In April this year I started this blog, but I also enrolled in the Fediverse, and decided to <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/my-own-mastodon-server.html">run my own instance</a>, therefore I was hosting again, that was not just a NGINX server, then I read <a href="https://yarmo.eu/post/selfhost-email">this</a>, <a href="https://yarmo.eu/post/selfhost-email-drawbacks">this</a> and <a href="https://lazybear.io/posts/should-you-sefhost-your-email/">this</a>.</p>

<p>And the idea of running my services was in my head again. I wanted to do it different with time, it is not 1998 anymore, so I decided to learn about <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/dockerize-everything.html">Docker</a>. So now I have in just one Arch Linux server:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two static sites</li>
  <li>One Wordpress Site</li>
  <li>One RSS reader (Miniflux)</li>
  <li>One password manager app (Bitwarden)</li>
  <li>One read-later app (<a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/wallabag-review.html">Wallabag</a>)</li>
  <li>One Webmention app <a href="https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/06/14/setting-up-webmentiond/">Webmentiod</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All running with Docker Compose files, but there was something missing, it was email. (Mastodon has its own server -yet-)</p>

<h2 id="hosting-your-own-email-server">Hosting your own email server</h2>

<p>I wanted to run an email server on Docker, so I looked for alternatives and I have found that there are some really nice.</p>

<h3 id="posteiohttpsposteio"><a href="https://poste.io/">Poste.io</a></h3>

<p>I have not tested it, but seems really easy to deploy it has a free version that I think is enough for personal use, with two professional options with a monthly charge.</p>

<h3 id="mailuiohttpsmailuio"><a href="https://mailu.io/">Mailu.io</a></h3>

<p>It is a clone of Poste.io, but using only free, Open Source alternatives, I have installed and configured, it took me just 45 minutes to have server running for one of my domains. It has a tool that create a configuration file based on your options, and it set up everything for you, you can find it <a href="https://setup.mailu.io/1.7/">here</a>, you only need to answer a few questions, and run three or four commands and there you have a complete email server.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SMTP</li>
  <li>IMAP</li>
  <li>POP3</li>
  <li>AntiSpam</li>
  <li>AntiVirus</li>
  <li>Webmail</li>
  <li>Admin web front-end</li>
</ul>

<p>Really a great option, I recommend it to anyone.</p>

<h3 id="docker-mail-serverhttpshubdockercomrtvialdocker-mailserver"><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tvial/docker-mailserver">Docker Mail Server</a></h3>

<p>Then I found this one, it is also a complete suite, all Open Source, with really good documentation, and ready to deploy on a server with Docker. It is not as easy as Mailu, but I decided to use it. I followed <a href="https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/wiki/Installation-examples">this guide</a>, yes I know, you still need Gmail or any other provider to send your emails, if you follow that guide. But I was not ready to jump into the pool completely.</p>

<p>So, here is my setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MX record points to my server, so all my email is received by my server</li>
  <li>All email is then forwarded to other accounts (Gmail accounts in this case)</li>
  <li>Gmail is configured to use those accounts as default and not the Gmail address, and uses my SMTP server to send</li>
</ul>

<p>This way I am sure I am using my domain, because we already agreed that <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/own-your-domain.html">everybody should own his domain</a>, right?. I am using Gmail as my email client.</p>

<p>I am doing this way, because it is easy to search emails when they are with Gmail, also because I am not sure if I may lose my server and lose some important email. I need to be sure about that, because I am hosting for my family, not only for me.</p>

<p>Also having an IMAP client on a cell phone drains the battery, because it polls the server even when there is nothing to download, or if you keep an open IMAP IDLE connection, it will also drain the battery. There is a solution for that, you need <a href="https://pushover.net/">PushOver</a>, and this <a href="https://pushover.net/">IMAP to PushOver</a> app, I have not tested yet, but I think is the way to go.</p>

<p>Edit: After reading some comments on Reddit, these three other options seems to be good ones too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mailcow.email/">MailCow</a>: Is another good option also mentioned on HN comments, and this one do have official Docker documentation <a href="https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mailinabox.email/">Mail in a Box</a>: Although there are not official instructions to install it on Docker, it should be possible, here is an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mtrnord/mailinabox/">outdated attempt</a>, and here <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/t/mail-in-a-box-in-docker/4588">another one</a>. But on a VPS it seems work great, and the admin pannel guides you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://iredmail.org/">iRedMail</a>: This one is also a good option, I have test it two months ago for a week and also works out of the box, you can find a well maintained docker instructions <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/lejmr/iredmail">here</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>

<p>If you plan to host your own email server, there are some important things you need to consider, and it is to properly configure your DNS server. Here is what you need:</p>

<h3 id="spf-record">SPF record</h3>

<p>You really need to configure a SPF record, it is not the same with all providers, but there is plenty of documentation, and it is not hard to do. This record basically tells the recipient server who is authorized to send mail on behalf of your domain. The most common configuration is that the MX server are the authorized ones, something like this.</p>

<pre><code>v=spf1 mx ~all
</code></pre>

<h3 id="dkim-record">DKIM record</h3>

<p>This one is a little bit more difficult, you need to create the DKIM key, your email server may do it, all examples above can do it, once you have it, you need to create a TXT record on your DNS and paste it there, it will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEArARSBHTh32y3VpSEe+pOI7AuILCUsYw1FNL5vTu1P3Mpte50jjkvzg+pBndcSzndQDt6B6mqLBbTwWrZR/j73CTI4ejcYL+xqSXYPU8+xNwu5uwHOMsgWMl15Z/1e1QJD9Ss3Q8aOLOkvHNIgAfSCq
</code></pre>

<p>All your emails will be signed with that, DKIM key, and the receiving server can check if the signature is valid, using the info from the DNS.</p>

<h3 id="dmarc-record">DMARC record</h3>

<p>This one is optional, but is better to have it, you can generate it using on-line tools like <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARCRecordGenerator.aspx">this one</a>. What it does is to tell what to do when something fails, and who to report that, usually the server admin, well you.</p>

<h3 id="ptr-record">PTR Record</h3>

<p>You need to have a PTR DNS records, that is the reverse DNS for the IP your server is using should point to the same name the A record has. So, for example, if you have this A record</p>

<pre><code>IN A mail.server.com 192.168.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>There should also be a reverse record like this.</p>

<pre><code>IN PTR 192.168.0.1 mail.server.com
</code></pre>

<p>You need to ask to the owner of the IP to add that record for you, if you are using a VPS, you can look in the documentation about that.</p>

<h3 id="mx-record">MX record</h3>

<p>Of course you need a MX record, but you already knew about this one, otherwise maybe is not a good idea to run your own server. This basically informs al sending servers which server is receiving email for your domain.</p>

<h3 id="test">Test</h3>

<p>Once you have set-up everything, wait 24 hours for DNS to propagate and test it, <a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/">this tool</a> is great</p>

<h3 id="secondary-mail-server">Secondary mail server</h3>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>After <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iatbst/how_self_host_your_email_server#c_hc7vvv">this comment</a> I want to add this recommendation too.</p>

<p>When the main server is down, email can not be delivered, usually it just stays in the senders queue, and once your server is up again all email is delivered to it, but if the outage is long enough some email might be returned to senders and the users will lose them.</p>

<p>The way to avoid this is to have a second machine running a secondary email server, this is simplier to setup, as it will only have the function to store email while the main server is down, and send all emails to it once is up again. There are some good documentation out there, <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/postfix_backup_mx">here</a> and <a href="https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/how-to-set-up-a-backup-email-server-postfix-ubuntu">here</a>.</p>

<p>The drawback is that now you have a second email to upgrade and keep running, and Spammers ususally target at it, so if you have backups for the main server, and you consider you can have it up and running relatively fast you can avoid a second email. One should also consider who's email is being hosted at the server, and how critical is that email for them.</p>

<p>Critical email might be on an Office 365 <strong>Exchange Online (Plan 1)</strong>, once again, under your domain.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>

<p>You may not need to host your email server, you can use <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>, <a href="https://www.zoho.com/es-xl/mail/">Zoho</a>, Office 365, or Google Suite, but you <strong>must</strong> use your domain, all accounts, all bank statements should be sent to an email address at your domain, otherwise you can lose control over your accounts. Hosting your email server is not an easy task, dealing with SPAM is hard, and downtimes can be a nightmare too, but you learn one or two things while hosting your email.</p>

<p>I had a brief run with a startup (literally a month) and was faced with the decision of going into a YC Cohort. In that fiasco, I also spent at least twelve hours trying to convince other people to go. It's been half a year, and I've had a lot more time to reflect on reasons as to why one might want to run a startup. As you might've guessed, I decided not to do it and I genuinely believe that running a startup seems like a bad idea for the majority of people I meet who want to become founders. </p>
<p>This post definitely will not apply to everyone (I'd loosely say applicable to 80% of prospective startup founders), but I'd hope there's some valuable thinking in here. Also, note that this is fairly oriented towards technical founders. </p>
<p>Edit: This post also has a very limited scope as it's based off the thinking from my decision to continue interning at Shopify or to go to YC. It's very focused on the Silicon Valley "startup" where you get a VC to give you money and get big in a year, etc etc</p>

<h3 id="commitment">Commitment<a href="#commitment" aria-label="Anchor link for: commitment"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I'm not talking about commitment to your company. I'm talking about commitment to your cofounder (if you have one, which is likely). </p>
<p>Maybe I'm too young to understand, but marriage seems frightening! My finances, my social life, personal time, and emotional wellbeing would be largely dependent on a single person and that's scary. It should be scary or should at least take a few years for it not to become scary. </p>
<p>Your cofounder is...kind of the same? In a seed-stage it's likely you <em>actually</em> live together, and if you don't, you're likely functionally living together with the amount of work involved. They're responsible for your financial well-being. They may be responsible for the quality of your social lives (most founders spend a lot of time socializing with other tech people + founders). They're tied to your life goals, your dreams, and your passions.</p>
<p>My impression was that my relationship with my cofounder would be more intense than marriage, and <em>extra</em> bad in the event of failure since there's additional loss (and it's statistically likely, but I guess so is marriage). I totally believe that there are cofounder pairs that are completely ready to go through the founder journey and pairs that maybe weren't ready but were fine anyway, but I stand by the statement that it's more intense than marriage and not enough people put care into this. </p>
<h3 id="your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here">Your VC is Not the One at Risk Here<a href="#your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here" aria-label="Anchor link for: your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I often hear sentiments that resemble "wow these VCs are taking a chance on me I better commit to this!". </p>
<p>VCs are not evil people trying to take advantage of you (actually they might be, but let's assume they're not), but they are not the ones at risk. For them, 150k or a few million is not a huge risk. Seed-stage returns will be from a very small percentage of investments, thus VCs can afford to have comically high error rates as long as they get the few that matter. If you're SoftBank you can do even worse and still have so much money! They make decisions carefully, they care about your success for various reasons, and are generally caring people (in most of my experiences) but in larger abstractions, your startup means nothing to them. </p>
<p>They're not shy about it either, the entire reason they're investing in you is because they think you're more valuable than you cost. 
<img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/founding/paul.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Your risk is years of your life, blood, sweat, and tears. The next few years (provided your startup lasts till then) will somewhat be in service to these VCs. The VCs are your "bosses" as you answer to them (though <em>much</em> less than a regular "boss") and to the ones you hope to raise capital from in the future. </p>
<p>It's good to take a risk with increased confidence because qualified people think you have promise. However, that can morph into "I'm going to work on this startup partially in service to these people who believed in me and gave me lots of money". These additional stresses that come from meeting VC expectations and the complications of the dynamics of the relationship can cause various problems.</p>
<h3 id="sense-of-self">Sense of Self<a href="#sense-of-self" aria-label="Anchor link for: sense-of-self"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This one is the one that got to me most but I can see it being irrelevant to a lot of other people. </p>
<p>Many founders have big egos -- I don't mean they're assholes or overly self-important but they do have very powerful confidence, because that's a valuable skill to have as a founder. Not just confidence in pitching their project to others, but in their vision and their company. They need to believe their company will be successful (though I have met founders who just want to party with VC money for a few years <em>cough cough</em> Neumann). </p>
<p>My first fear was that I created an ego for myself rapidly. Practicing to sell to clients and for your YC interview involves repeating to yourself why you are <em>good</em> and self-hypnosis is fairly powerful. I love feeling good about myself, but I suddenly found myself feeling more confident in myself than what I believed was warranted. More frighteningly, I had a major character and energy change in a couple of weeks. Losing so much of my identity like that was unnerving, not to mention the ripple effects that could've occurred in my social life. </p>
<p>The other fear is coming down from that. Startup founders (especially the more eccentric ones) sometimes believe that they will build something that will change the world. Along with that, their identities start to merge with their company. There's nothing wrong with that, but I also think it's exceptionally tragic to come down from that. It's not just dealing with failure and getting back up on your feet, it's losing a part of your identity. </p>
<h3 id="school-is-generally-a-good-idea-for-prospective-dropouts">School is Generally a Good Idea (for prospective dropouts)<a href="#school-is-generally-a-good-idea-for-prospective-dropouts" aria-label="Anchor link for: school-is-generally-a-good-idea-for-prospective-dropouts"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Being a good engineer seems underrated for being a good startup founder. Not just being able to code fast, but being able to make good engineering decisions, conduct good technical interviews and attract talent. Some engineering skills can't be worked around with "I am very smart and can learn fast" and require extended time and practice. With that, I also think prospective founders also overestimate the amount of learning on the job that can be done on the engineering side, mostly because it's harder to learn when you're in a rush to release features than if you could take your time on a course project. It's true that founders will learn more than they will in school, but the technical development may not be as strong. My model is that the best schooling experience is better technical education and the best founding experience. </p>

<h3 id="something-to-own">Something to Own<a href="#something-to-own" aria-label="Anchor link for: something-to-own"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Lots of huge, ground-breaking products have been lead from within a large company. Examples include email client <code>hey.com</code>, Chromebooks, and countless amazing dev tools. </p>
<p>Starting these things in a large company has the benefit of security, resources and recruiting already done for you. Downsides include beaurocracy, not being able to recruit on your own accord and dealing with PR policy. There is also high barriers to starting something within a company, like being senior enough to do so and being at the right company at the right time. </p>
<p>The alternative is starting a project on the side. <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig">Ziglang</a> was started as a side project and is now a very promising programming language. The creator has since then left his job to work on Zig, but it is also possible to "own" something significant without even having to leave your job. Examples includes Julia Evan's <a href="https://jvns.ca/">blog</a> (not actually a work-side-project) and line of zines, Cassidy William's <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-dsa-astrolokeys-keycaps-by-sailorhg-and-cassidoo">keycap line</a>, Nick Frosst's successful and awesome <a href="https://goodkidofficial.com/">band</a> and many more. I understand that it's not the extent of "oh yeah Google? I built that", but I think the expected value is much higher in creating and owning something that isn't a startup. </p>
<h3 id="getting-rich">Getting Rich<a href="#getting-rich" aria-label="Anchor link for: getting-rich"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A lot of people claim that startups are less money, but I find for signicant number of founders, that's not true -- not because they'll definitely have a good exit, but because they're skilled in ways that allow them to raise enough money to pay themselves like they would at a big company. If that applies to you, then going to a startup probably is your best shot at getting rich! For other people, the expected value of industry (particularly joining a well-founded early-stage startup) is usually higher. </p>
<h3 id="not-being-at-school-for-prospective-dropouts">Not Being at School (for prospective dropouts)<a href="#not-being-at-school-for-prospective-dropouts" aria-label="Anchor link for: not-being-at-school-for-prospective-dropouts"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This seems like a valid reasons for the average CS student. School is a place where you answer to professors who don't always understand industry and do homework assignments that no one will care about. However, it seems like all of these problems can be significantly if not fully solved by building a better school experience for yourself. </p>
<p>A better program can improve many things, such as <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College of Engineering</a> that has a project-based curriculum, <a href="https://www.makeschool.com/">Make School</a> that is a two year applied-engineering degree program or <a href="https://devdegree.ca/">Dev Degree</a>, where you can work at Shopify and take more applied courses taught by Shopify throughout your degree. These programs are small and selective, but probably not harder than a semi-successful startup. Dev Degree also happens to be more financially sound, with Shopify paying for your tuition and a salary, and Make School tuition is 70k for the entire degree. </p>
<p>Another alternative is to just be worse at school and learn on the side and/or to morph your silly school assignments into productive skills and useful outputs. The <a href="http://coconut-lang.org/">Coconut Programming Language</a> was built by someone while they were in school. Some things like dynamic programming that are often deemed useless theoretical things can have <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/06/17/tree-diffing/">industry applications</a>. People have also taken mundane school projects like this compiler that almost every school will have you build in a compilers course and end up with <a href="https://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/">educational findings for engineers in general</a> (also see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20192645">HackerNews thread</a>). In five weeks, my friend Maas was able to launch <a href="https://medium.com/@maaslalani/launch-5d02cc5e05f5">five relatively successful products</a> while enrolled in Dev Degree. </p>
<p>School is already a powerful environment of hardwork, fun and learning. I think it is a more cohesive …</p></section></article></main></div>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose.

            <p>OTTAWA -- 
	As U.S. members of Congress push Canada to reopen its shared border with the United States, Canadians are pushing back — both in government and on social media.</p>
<p>
	In an <a href="https://higgins.house.gov/sites/higgins.house.gov/files/6-3-20%20NORTHERN%20BORDER%20LETTER.pdf">open letter</a> addressed to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, 29 bipartisan members of Congress called on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.</p>
<p>
	"We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions," read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the border closure.</p>
<p>
	"We understand the importance of prioritizing the safety of our communities as we all navigate the complex calculation of minimizing public health risks and resuming economic activity. However, the social and economic partnership between our two nations necessitates a clear pathway forward," the letter read.</p>
<p>
	They crafted the letter following the latest joint Canada-U.S. agreement to extend the current border closure until July 21. This is the third time the agreement to maintain the border closure has been extended.</p>
<p>
	Despite the United States' plea, a spokesperson for Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTVNews.ca in a Friday statement that the health and safety of Canadians is "absolutely priority."</p>
<p>
	"Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians," said Freeland's spokesperson, Katherine Cuplinskas, in the statement.</p>
<p>
	"Since the beginning of this global pandemic, we have been having friendly ongoing conversations with our American partners about our shared border. Both sides agree that the current measures in place, which are set to expire on July 21st, have worked well in restricting non-essential travel while allowing essential crossings to continue unimpeded."</p>
<p>
	Freeland's office wasn’t alone in pushing back against the call. Higgins posted the open letter in full <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBrianHiggins/status/1279120917134741505">on his Twitter page</a> and he was swiftly met with backlash on the social media platform.</p>
<p>
	One comment, which had three times as many likes as Higgins' original post, slammed the call.</p>
<p>
	"No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada," <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelletypoQ/status/1280674509821894657">wrote</a> a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.</p>
<p>
	Another user, @rachelinTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelinTO/status/1281404365954260993">wrote</a> that "most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So...... that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh."</p>
<p>
	Other users called the request "disastrous" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.</p>
<p>
	The United States reached a macabre milestone at the end of June when it became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. It also has the highest death toll in the world, with 120,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>
	Shortly after the news broke about the soaring cases in the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was considering next steps for the looming deadline of the current border closure.</p>
<p>
	Speaking in a press conference on June 29, with just over three weeks until the agreement expires, he said the government will continue to assess the situation at our shared border.</p>
<p>
	"We have extended the border measures with the United States until July 21. We will continue to assess the situation and work with the Americans on what steps need to be taken into the month of August," Trudeau said.</p>
<p>
	And as COVID-19 continues to affect countries around the world, Trudeau said the health of Canadians remains the top priority when considering the loosening of any border restrictions.</p>
<p>
	"We are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders," Trudeau said.</p>

  <h2>NumPy Fundamentals for Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-07-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Jul 2020</time>
  

  <hr>



<hr>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: If you prefer to read with a <strong>white background and black font</strong>, you can see this article in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/pabloinsente/intro-sc-python/blob/master/notebooks/intro-numpy-fundamentals.ipynb">here</a>. Las time I check SVG images rendered just fine.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that <strong>NumPy is at the core of the entire scientific computing Python ecosystem</strong>, both as a standalone package for numerical computation and as the engine behind most data science packages.</p>

<p>In this document, I review <code>NumPy</code> main components and functionality, with attention to the needs of Data Science and Machine Learning practitioners, and people who aspire to become a data professional. My only assumption is that you have basic familiarity with Python, things like variables, lists, tuples, and loops. Advance Python concepts like Object Oriented Programming are not touched at all.</p>

<p>The resources I used to build this tutorial are three:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>NumPy</code> documentation</li>
  <li>A few miscellaneous articles from the Internet</li>
  <li>My own experience with <code>NumPy</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Content-wise, I’ll say that ~95% is based on <code>NumPy</code> v1.18 manual, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html">NumPy user guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html">NumPy reference</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/about.html">NumPy about</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The rest ~5% comes from a couple of random articles on the Internet and Stack Overflow. I resort to those sources mostly to clarify concepts and functionality that wasn’t clear for me from <code>NumPy</code> documentation.</p>

<p>My own experience was the base to organize the tutorial, explain concepts, create practical examples, create images, etc.</p>

<p>“<em>Why are you using the documentation as the main source of content, instead of the many great tutorials online?</em>” Because it is the most up-to-date, complete, and reliable source about <code>NumPy</code> (and about any library for that matter).</p>

<p>“<em>Why then I should read this if everything comes from the documentation?</em>” Well, you don’t need to read this, you are right. Actually, I encourage you to read the documentation and learn from there. What I can offer is my own: <strong>(1) organization of contents, (2) selection of contents, (3) explanations and framing of concepts, (4) images, (5) practical examples, (6) and general perspective.</strong></p>

<p>This tutorial is part of a larger project I am working on, which is an introduction to Python and its libraries for scientific computing, data science, and machine learning that you can find <a href="https://github.com/pabloinsente/intro-sc-python">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to interact with this Notebook, you can open a MyBinder interactive instance by clicking in the MyBinder icon:</p>

<p>As a final note, <strong>if you are <code>NumPy</code> expert, advanced user, or developer</strong>, you may find some inaccuracies or lack of depth in some of my explanations. Two things: (1) feel free to suggest a better explanation or something that I may add to make things clearer, (2) I prioritize conciseness and accessibility over the accuracy, so the lack of accuracy or depth sometimes it is intentional from my part.</p>

<h2 id="python-is-slow">Python is slow</h2>

<p>Scientific and numerical computing often requires processing massive datasets with complex algorithms. If you are a scientist or data professional, you want a programming language than can process data FAST. <strong>The closer a programming language is to machine instructions (binary), the faster it runs</strong>. That’s why for decades, programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran, were the to-go option for data-intensive applications in science and technology.</p>

<p>However, writing code in compiled languages like C++ and Fortran can be slow and, frankly, terribly annoying (but that’s just me!). Scientists are not coders (although many end up mutating into scientist-coder hybrids over time, that’s a whole other subject). From a scientist’s perspective, <strong>the easier and faster to write code, the better</strong>. High-level programming languages, i.e., languages that are closer to human language rather than to machine language do meet such requirements. The likes of Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, fits the bill: <strong>easy to write, easy to learn, easy to run</strong>. But, instructions written in high-level programming languages are slow to run by computers, for complicated reasons I do not explore here. The fact is that they are slower to run than C++ or Fortran.</p>

<p>Scientists face a conundrum: they need an <strong>easy to write</strong> AND <strong>fast to run</strong> programming language. They need the best of both worlds. For a long time, such language simply did not exist. Then Python came along.</p>

<p>Oh wait, Python it is, indeed, easy to learn and write, <em>but slow to run compared to compiled languages</em>. Like really, really slow. For instance, computing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm">spectral-norm of a matrix</a>, which is a common task in data applications, <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/performance/spectralnorm.html">has been benchmarked</a> at ~1.9 seconds in C, whereas python takes a whopping ~170.1 seconds, meaning that Python is ~90 times <em>slower</em>. Considering this, the fact Python became the dominant language in machine learning and data science is a bit of a puzzle.</p>

<p>There are at least two reasons for this why Python succeed anyways.</p>

<p>The first is that as computing capacity became cheaper, <strong>processing time has become less important than coding-time</strong>. Basically, the time you save by writing code in high-level yet slow to-run programming languages compensates by their lack of performance at run time. And Python is exceptionally clean, intuitive, and easy to learn, compared to C or Fortran.</p>

<p>The second reason, which is probably the major one, is <strong>libraries</strong>. Particularly libraries written in low-level high-performant languages. Turns out that Python extensibility allows programmers to write the “engine” for numerical computation in languages like C and Fortran, and then Python can invoke such “engines” in the background, meaning that although you write code in Python, it is executed in compiled C or Fortran code instead of Python itself. And that is how you obtain the best of both worlds: <strong>the easy and fast developing time of Python, plus the runtime performance of C or Fortran</strong>. True, there is some small overhead of going back and forth between languages, but its impact it’s minimal.</p>

<p>It is important to mention that nowadays, new programming languages have been created exactly with these two necessities (fast development + fast performance) in mind, like <strong><a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a></strong>. In the spectral-norm test, Julia was benchmarked at ~2.79 seconds, almost as fast as C. Additionally, Julia is a dynamic language, easy to learn, and write in like Python. Why not Julia then? Probably because of the relative immaturity of its packages ecosystem compared to Python. Julia first appeared in 2012, whereas Python was introduced in 1990. The availability of well-tested libraries for pretty much anything you can imagine in Python is unparalleled. A second reason is probably that Python does not cost you performance anyways (with its libraries), so Why not?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-numpy">What is NumPy</h2>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that <strong>NumPy is at the core of the entire scientific computing Python ecosystem</strong>, both as a standalone package for numerical computation and as the engine behind most data science packages.</p>

<p>NumPy is a package for array-like or matrix-like high-performance computation. Its “engine” is written in C, meaning that NumPy utilized “in the background” pre-compiled C code to perform computations.</p>

<h2 id="installing-numpy">Installing NumPy</h2>

<p>If you are running this Notebook in <code>MyBinder</code> or locally after running the <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> file, you have <code>NumPy</code> installed already. Otherwise, you will need to install <code>NumPy</code> with one of these options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scientific Python Distributions</li>
  <li>pip</li>
  <li>System-wide installation via a package manager (apt, brew, etc.)</li>
  <li>From NumPy source code</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 4 is for developers who need to alter source code. Option 3 is not recommended as a system-wide installation of packages may generate dependency conflicts.</p>

<p>Option 1 is probably the simplest and it’s widely used by practitioners. Within this category we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Mini-conda</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://winpython.github.io/">WinPython</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pyzo.org/">Pyzo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>WinPython and Pyzo are less used and I do not have any experience with them. Feel free to experiment with them at your own risk. Anaconda and mini-conda are the most popular options. Anaconda basically is a large bundle of packages for Python and R, and a …</p></article></section></div></div>

<p>As I spend more and more time working with bloated frameworks in web development I am starting to miss the minimalism I saw when I got started. I wish websites didn’t need to load megabytes of data to display simple pages. I believe a lot of websites do not benefit at all from frameworks like <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>. Some have told me that these pages just need to be optimized but as far as I can tell this just spreads the loading of files out over time, you will still end up with a site of several megabytes after navigating pages.</p>



<h2>How do we define minimalism?</h2>



<p>I believe we need less javascript and css for the web. Things can still look great  and be done quickly without a bunch of frameworks. I believe this is what we like to call minimalism in web development. Looking at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism" target="_blank">Wikipedia I found a good definition for minimalism</a> and it’s defined like so:</p>



<pre>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user interface design</a>, minimalism describes the usage of fewer design elements,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flat design</a>, fewer options and features, and tendencially less occupied screen space. </pre>



<p>This definition fits well and I believe it’s good to follow this principle. However, I have seen many minimalist user interfaces that look great but take ages to load and use megabytes of data. If we try to use minimalism in web design shouldn’t we also use minimalism when it comes to the underlying code? I found an article called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://itnext.io/my-minimalist-approach-to-software-engineering-5bc743ecb295" target="_blank">My Minimalist Approach To Software Engineering</a> where the author touches on this topic. Libraries and frameworks can be good but there is a lot we can do in web development without them. In this article and hopefully future articles I would like to explore what we can do with minimalist web development.</p>



<p>In addition to what I have written here there is an article called <a href="https://meiert.com/en/blog/minimal-web-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Short Guide To Minimal Web Development</a> which I found while researching this topic. I think it outlines a lot of the things for frontend development which I would like to cover but I also want to apply the principle to backend development. Frameworks and libraries have their uses but they are not needed for most web applications.</p>



<blockquote><p>The idea, however, is that we can only tell what’s really needed&nbsp;<em>once we can tell what’s really important</em>, and why it’s really important.</p><cite>Jens Oliver Meiert (<a href="https://meiert.com/en/blog/minimal-web-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://meiert.com/en/blog/minimal-web-development/</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<h2>When do we need a backend?</h2>



<p>You may need a backend to a web application when you have dynamic content. Now, there is no simple definition for dynamic content. Basically, if you have any form of user authentication or storage shared between users you will need a backend. A lot of things such as blogs, games, live chats and more may have dynamic content but do not need any backend to perform their function if authentication is not needed. Most sites will fall into the first category of authentication but there are some sites out there which need a backend but do not require authentication. These types of sites may exists to provide simple functions like uploading and sharing files or tracking and storing user behaviour.</p>



<p>Many sites like blogs or even news sites will do fine with basic HTML files with no extra code. However, for convenience some people do like to use a backend such as WordPress. WordPress lets you easily create new posts and pages. This does however come with the added cost of complexity and performance. HTML files tend to load quickly and there is very little that can go wrong. Once you add a backend with authentication there may be hundreds of checks that execute on every page load. You also have to maintain a backend, keep it updated and ensure that malicious users don’t gain access to it.</p>



<p>When making a new site you should always begin by asking if you really need a backend. </p>



<h2>When is a backend framework needed?</h2>



<p>A backend framework is never really needed. But a framework can help speed things up and provide a ready made structure. It’s similar to building a house, you build everything from scratch or use prefabricated houses where all the pieces are already made. </p>



<p>A framework therefore helps standardise things so that it is easier for multiple developers to work on the same project. However, there should always be some consideration as to if a framework is really needed. If you’re building a landing page you don’t need frameworks. You could probably use a simple PHP file for this instead of a full framework like Laravel. Using a framework will add overhead and complexity to the application, especially if it’s small. In the end you are trading development speed for flexibility, stability, performance and security.</p>



<h2>When is a frontend framework needed?</h2>



<p>Frontend frameworks like React, Angular and Vue have become very popular in the last years. I think these frameworks are needed even less than backend frameworks. Most websites do not need any javascript at all to provide their core functionality. The backend can generate html pages with any needed data and this can be styled with a bit of css. </p>



<p>One argument I have heard is that these frameworks allow you to load a page once and then only make requests for the data that you need. This is referred to as a single page application and I can see how it provides benefits for large applications with lots of data. However, most websites do not load large sets of data in this way and can provide pages that are small in size and load quickly. Many single page applications load so many different libraries that they often reach over a megabyte in size which is huge. </p>



<p>You end up trading a slow initial load for many smaller pages that load quickly. It’s also tends to become impossible to keep track of all the libraries that these frontend applications use. There have been several recent incidents where a small package had a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22979245" target="_blank">bug</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://harry.garrood.me/blog/malicious-code-in-purescript-npm-installer/" target="_blank">security issue</a> which affected millions of applications. Frontend frameworks should be avoided unless they provide substantial benefits. Frontend frameworks might allow you to get something produced more quickly but once again you trade development speed for flexibility, stability, performance and security.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As I gain more and more experience in web development I am starting to miss the simplicity and speed of the old days. I think we need to find a way back to the simple application. I am personally starting to simplify the websites I run. </p>



<p>As I write this I am using WordPress to manage my posts. However, I am working on a new backend called <a href="https://github.com/markustenghamn/beubo">Beubo</a>. With <a href="https://github.com/markustenghamn/beubo">Beubo</a> I want to simplify the backend to something very basic and rethink how the backend should work. I want to write guides that teach minimalism in web development from the very start. Too many web developers start with frameworks and never learn the simplicity of vanilla CSS, JS and HTML. </p>



<p>I think there is more and more push for simplicity and minimalism in web development.  This is as companies become more and more liable for the security of their applications. For a long time there were no real consequences of running insecure web applications. Focus has shifted towards development speed. However, with the rise of GDPR and similar laws we will see more companies looking to simplify. To reduce the amount of libraries and frameworks that are used in order to keep applications more secure and stable.</p>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>We're often told a business' culture is secondary to its other functions (growth, profit, survival etc.) I imagine that many companies facing the threat of recession don't consider their culture to be of immediate concern; understandably it will be irrelevant if they cease to exist. But as I explain in this article, it has the potential to become a strong force.</p><h3>What do I mean by culture?</h3><p>It's the way a company behaves. I think the following extract from Ben Horowitz's book "What You Do Is Who You Are" most succintly describes this:</p><blockquote><p>The right answers for your company depend on what your company is, what it does, and what it wants to be. In fact, how your employees answer these questions <i>is</i> your culture. Because your culture is how your employees make decisions when you're not there. It's the set of assumptions your employees use to resolve the problems they face every day. It's how they behave when no one is looking.</p></blockquote><p>Culture is both the product of a company's behaviour (the collective behaviours of its employees) and an indicator of the organisation's relationship with its people.<br></p><h3>Culture is not a set of values</h3><p>I think the confusion between "values" and culture is why so many 
businesses seem to get it wrong. Values are aspirational; they describe 
what a business <i>wants</i> to be but may not have any correlation with how it <i>actually</i> behaves and operates. Unless used to guide decision-making, values do not indicate culture. Culture cannot be merely decided on or chosen, but guided and nurtured.</p><h3>Why bad cultures lead to failure</h3><p>In order to survive, a business must continually generate and implement new ideas. There are many external and competitive forces (commonly known as Michael Porter's "Five Forces") that shape how a company operates. Its ability to articulate and implement ideas so that it may adapt to these forces is what will determine whether it succeeds or dies.</p><p>Where a poor culture is present, a business cannot hope to <i>thrive</i>: It may not reach its sales targets, it might have a high staff turnover or the quality of work may deteriorate.<br></p><h3>The conditions for growth</h3><p>If a Biologist creates the conditions for a cell culture to grow, a business leader must carefully cultivate the conditions in which their employees' behaviours evolve. While some behaviours can be encouraged and rewarded, others may emerge of their own accord. While a manager assigns and delegates work, a healthy culture is the mark of good leadership.</p><h3>The actions of leaders<br>
</h3><p>The actions of leaders are just one of the ways a business's culture can be influenced. Whether consciously or not, a leader may "normalise" certain behaviours in his or her executive team. For example, if a leader is particularly critical of a manager's ideas, managers are also likely to be more selective of their own team's ideas. Simply rewarding undesirable types of behaviour, like for example awarding a promotion to an employee not on merit alone may send the wrong kind of message to others. As Ben Horowitz explains in "The Hard Thing About Hard Things", this can have far-reaching consequencues:</p><blockquote>
<p>When you are CEO, senior employees will come to you from time to time and ask for an increase in compensation. They may suggest that you are paying them far less than their current market value. They may even have a competitive offer in hand...</p>
<p>You might even give the employee a raise. This may sound innocent, but you have just created a strong incentive for political behaviour. Specifically, you will be rewarding behaviour that has nothing to do with advancing your business...</p>
<p>The object lesson for your staff and the company will be that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and that the most politically astute employees get the raises. Get ready for a whole lot of squeaky wheels.</p>
</blockquote><p>As L. David Marquet suggests in "Turn the Ship Around", one way a leader can reinforce desired behaviours is through immediate recognition, in other words recognising and rewarding good behaviours quickly and publicly. He writes, "Immediate recognition can be used as a mechanism for <i>clarity</i>."<br></p><h3>Trust<br>
</h3><p>A team's trust that their manager believes in and supports their ideas will hugely influence how they perceive the organisation's culture. A team that doesn't feel comfortable offering suggestions and sharing ideas stagnates. The following excerpt from "Turn the Ship Around" explains this:</p><blockquote><p>Trust means this: When you report that we should position the ship in a certain position, <i>you believe </i>we should position the ship as you indicated. Not trusting you would mean that I thought you might be saying one thing while <i>actually</i> believing something else. Trust is purely a characteristic of the human relationship.</p></blockquote><p>To establish trust, leaders must ultimately tell the truth. While sometimes this isn't as easy as it sounds, as Ben Horowitz explains in WYDIWYA, leaders can attach their own meaning to reality. He writes:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine the reality you have to assign meaning to is a layoff... if you assign meaning to the layoff before anyone else, and you do so candidly and convincingly, your interpretation has a decent chance of being the one that everyone remembers.<br></p></blockquote><p>Trust can also apply the other way. A manager must trust his or her team to carry out their work to the best of their ability. A team that isn't motivated to work hard usually has an ineffective culture, but a manager must also incentivise their staff to work hard by seeing that their suggestions are implemented. As Andy Grove says in "High Output Management":</p><blockquote><p>...management has to develop and nurture the common set of values, objectives, and methods essential for the existence of trust. How do we do that? One is by <i>articulation</i>, by spelling out these values, objectives, and methods. The other, even more important, way is by <i>example</i>. If our behaviour at work will be regarded as in line with the values we profess, that fosters the development of a group culture.</p></blockquote><p>Trust is paramount to any kind of healthy working relationship, but organisations that don't have some degree of trust cannot collaborate.<br></p><h3>Empowerment</h3><p>Business leaders must find ways for their employees to actively participate in decision-making at all levels of the organisation. Merely being told what to do by a superior is not motivating, especially when you may not agree with the reasoning behind doing the work in the first place. Empowerment involves giving employees the opportunity to influence how their work turns out; so that they can see the direct link between their efforts and the outcome.</p><p>One strategy L. David Marquet suggests, to empower subordinates and increase proactivity, is by changing the language an organisation uses. He writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>Here is a short list of "disempowered phrases" that passive followers use:<br>- Request permission to...<br>- I would like to...<br>- What should I do about...</p>
<p>Here is a short list of "empowered phrases" that active doers use:<br>- I intend to...<br>- I plan to...<br>- I will...</p>
<p>...Eventually we turned everything upside down. Instead of one captain giving orders to 134 men, we would have 135 independent, energetic, emotionally committed and engaged men thinking about what we needed to do and ways to do it right. This process turned them into active leaders as opposed to passive followers.</p>
</blockquote><h3>Failure</h3><p>How a business reacts to and learns from failure goes hand-in-hand with its attitude to trust and empowerment. A team that uses failure as an opportunity to learn is usually one that's empowered. But only teams with a degree of trust are able to learn from their mistakes. The alternative is an organisation in which employees are blamed for mistakes, creating a culture of fear. Fear is not conducive to trust. In "Creativity Inc.", Ed Catmull writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself what happens when an error is discovered. Do people shut down and turn inward, instead of coming together to untangle the causes of the problems that might be avoided going forward? Is the question being asked: Whose fault was this? If so, your culture is one that vilifies failure...</p>
<p>If you create a fearless culture (or as fearless as human nature will allow), people will be much less hesitant to explore new areas, identifying uncharted pathways and then charging down them.</p>
</blockquote><p>While often it's important to recognise failure, especially failure that's expensive or damaging, leaders may inadvertently create ineffective cultures by finding scapegoats. But a culture of fear is toxic and contageous. Instead leaders, must use failure to find opportunities for their teams to grow.<br></p><h3>The benefits of an effective culture</h3><p>Different organisations will have different understandings of what a healthy culture includes and the behaviours they want to encourage but ultimately, the mark of all good cultures is a productive (and hopefully happy) workforce. <br></p><p>It's important to note that a perfect culture will never be attainable, but the value of a workforce that enjoys its work, versus one that doesn't, cannot be underestimated.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This was originally posted as a <a href="https://twitter.com/dmi3f/status/1283100690491965441?s=20">Twitter thread</a>, hence the style.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ec59QLAVAAANJC2.png" alt="Screenshot from Grafana showing an example of a dashboard"></p>

<p>Monitoring should be the next thing you set up after a <strong>reliable and fast</strong> CI/CD system.</p>

<p>Ultimately monitoring helps you understand your systems better. That in turn helps you address issues <strong>quickly</strong> when they arise. It’s a productivity tool.</p>

<p>Monitoring is for app developers too, not just ops / devops / infrastructure people.</p>

<p>If you’re new to monitoring, here are a few examples of things you might want to monitor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🖼️ Number of images people upload</li>
  <li>😞 Errors per second from email service</li>
  <li>📈 HTTP server response times</li>
  <li>💰 Money spent on S3 per day</li>
  <li>📱 Daily active users</li>
  <li>🌡️ Temperature in the data center</li>
</ul>

<p>For a good real-life example of a mature monitoring setup I would refer you to <a href="https://dashboards.gitlab.com/d/RZmbBr7mk/gitlab-triage?refresh=30s&amp;orgId=1">GitLab’s Grafana page</a>.</p>

<p>So let’s say I convinced you that you need a monitoring system. What’s next?</p>

<p><strong>Most people, even the ones with a lot of industry experience, never worked with a good monitoring system.</strong></p>

<p>This means you might have to do a lot of advocating &amp; educating. And it will take time.</p>

<p>Educate people on your teams about monitoring. Show examples of how it helped you solve real issues. Give internal talks, mention it in code reviews, slack, email, meetings — use any opportunity to tell people about it. You have to do it <strong>at least 3 times</strong> for it to stick.</p>

<p>This advice also applies to any other productivity tool you’re trying to get your team to use.</p>

<p>Us software engineers like to pretend we’re living on the bleeding edge of technology. In reality we’re often set in our ways and just as stubborn as everyone else. It takes extra effort to convince people there are tools that are objectively better than what they’re used to.</p>

<p>Make it easy to add metrics. Have a simple API in your apps, light docs. Have a <strong>reliable and fast</strong> CI/CD system and <strong>not too much process</strong> so that there’s no friction around adding new metrics.</p>

<p><strong>A good monitoring system is one where it’s easy and cheap to add metrics.</strong></p>

<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>

<p>When you’re debugging an issue, think about what kind of metrics would help you and add those metrics, even if you already fixed the issue.</p>

<p><strong>There’s no such thing as having too many metrics</strong>. You’ll never say, “I wish I didn’t have this metric”. However, you will say things like “This dashboard has too much going on”, or “Our monitoring is down because we’re writing too much”.</p>

<p>This just means you have to a) keep your dashboards tidy, b) take a good care of your monitoring infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>A good dashboard at a glance gives you leads on what’s going on in your system, and at a closer look gives you answers.</strong></p>

<p>Create dashboards for teams, projects, separate sub-systems. Keep them simple and generic — you want others to be able to use it without much onboarding.</p>

<p>Another good way to organize dashboards is to make a hierarchy of dashboards. Create a main one with high level insights about the health of separate subsystems and links to relevant dashboards with more information.</p>

<p>Give good names to your dashboards and graphs. Give metrics proper units. Add links to other dashboards. There’s no rules, it’s an art, kind of like naming variables.</p>

<p>Allow everyone on the team to create their own <strong>playground dashboards</strong> — and let people do whatever they want there. These are also good for ad-hoc analysis.</p>

<p>Don’t put dashboards on a giant TV screen in your office — no one will actually look at it.</p>

<p>So how much does it cost to run a good monitoring system? Your mileage may vary, but I’ll give some ballpark figures.</p>

<p>On average you’ll spend about 1% of your total cloud / hosting costs on monitoring. It will also take about 1% of your team’s time to keep the system up and running.</p>

<p>Is it worth it? In my experience the benefits outweigh the costs many times over.</p>

<p>Just don’t forget to treat your monitoring infrastructure well. Set up monitoring (yes), do regular cleanups and upgrades. Address performance issues promptly when they arise.</p>

<p>Now that we have a good monitoring system, we can talk about alerts. But that’s for another day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
  

  
  

  <div>
  <p>Late last month, I said I’d be looking into WSL, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which is still a work in progress and available for Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with WSL, it’s an easy way to run just about any Linux distro in a VM within Windows. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/">Microsoft explains it better than I can</a>.</p>
<p>The first version was a little slow due to the architecture, but now Microsoft has WSL2, which slips a very small but capable Linux kernel in the middle of the architecture, like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ba4baf212004a3d4db687bc90a859151d0abf8f5/412a4/images/wsl-2-architecture.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This allows Windows 10 users to use Windows apps that interact quickly with Linux apps. For example, I installed and configured WSL2 and then grabbed Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store. (YES, the Microsoft Store is where you get the distros!)</p>
<p>I upgrade Ubuntu packages as needed and installed Node.js and Gatsby, which is what I’m using to experiment with an open source blog platform that generates super fast static sites: <a href="https://www.kctofel.com/post/2020-06-18-the-great-gatsby-vs-hugo-for-static-site-generation/">More info here on what I’m doing</a>.</p>
<p>I already had VSCode installed on the Windows side, by the way. And that’s important. Here’s why, in a general sense, per Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WSL 2 includes a huge architecture change using virtualization technology, and we are still working on improving the networking support. Since WSL 2 now runs in a virtual machine, you will need to use that VM’s IP address to access Linux networking applications from Windows, and vice versa you will need the Windows host’s IP address to access Windows networking applications from Linux</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this effectively means is that Windows apps can access the Linux filesystem, apps and such.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a quick and dirty “Hello World” blog post/page I created on the Linux side using Node.js and Gatsby. But the page is displayed in Chrome on Windows 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/29c153c17960bcb66f32ea49e0b8d9ed938c6d48/74d44/images/gatsby-in-wsl2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that I’m using VSCode in Windows here. At the bottom left of VSCode, you can see that it’s actually letting me work on the Linux instance.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>This reminds me of Google’s Project Crostini, which debuted in 2018: It’s a similar solution for Chromebooks.</p>
<p>You enable Linux on a Chromebook and you get a Linux container within a VM. That Linux instance looks native to Chrome OS and can run full Linux GUI desktop apps. Microsoft’s WSL2 can’t do that yet, however, the company is working on that.</p>
<p>I’ve written extensively about using Linux for development on a Chromebook but the most recent useful article is this one: “<a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/can-you-learn-to-code-in-a-college-computer-science-program-with-a-chromebook/">Can you learn to code in a college Computer Science program with a Chromebook?</a>”</p>
<p>The answer is yes if the development tools, IDEs and such that your program requires are available for Linux. For me it’s a yes.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2353ca41b33c0ac2ac4b5cf4295d0aa2ffd43d86/9eedf/images/linked-lists-in-java-on-a-chromebook.jpg" alt="" title="Linked Lists in Java on a Chromebook"></p>
<p>If WSL is of interest, I can’t recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/j0PPcUUtHlw">this YouTube video enough from Scott Hanselman</a>. It’s 45 minutes long but I know I learned more than 45 things about WSL while watching it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p><time datetime="2020-03-30T12:52:24+0530">Mon, Mar 30, 2020</time></p><p>It all began a few days ago when I visited a <em>.in</em> domain that I knew didn’t exist and instead of getting an error page from the browser, as one might expect, I got a blank page. Well, a blank page for me because I was using an ad-blocker(uBlock Origin) otherwise I would have seen a page filled with ads. This behavior would have been easily explained if I was using ISP provided DNS server for resolving queries. How?<br>
Let’s start with DNS(Domain Name System). DNS is responsible for mapping domain names to IP addresses and they send an NXDOMAIN(Non-Existent Domain) response if the requested domain name cannot be found and the browser will show an appropriate error page. Some DNS servers, especially the ones provided by ISPs, might resolve queries for non-existing domains to IP address of servers they control which will show ads instead of an NXDOMAIN response which will trigger the usual error page. I was aware that this is a <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/17/dzuiba_virgin_media_opendns/">common practice among many ISPs</a>, but I was not using the default DNS recursive name server provided by the ISP but Cloudflare’s <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">1.1.1.1</a> – which certainly does not have such malpractices.<br>
I made sure that my OS was not overriding the DNS server set at router by checking <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. It had:</p>
<pre><code>...
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0
search domain.name
</code></pre><p>and <code>systemd-resolve --status</code> showed:</p>
<pre><code>...
Global
          DNS Servers: 192.168.1.1
          DNS Domain: domain.name
          DNSSEC NTA: ...
...
</code></pre><p>This shows that the OS is indeed using the DNS server provided by the router, which uses 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 as resolvers.<br>
There was no point in blindly trying any further to figure out what was wrong. Time to <em>see</em> what is actually happening using packet sniffing. I used <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to capture DNS query and response packets when visiting qwertyasdf123[.]in, which is a non-existent domain. And this is what it captured:</p>
<p><img src="https://harigovind.org/img/content/article/nxdomain-hijacking/wireshark_dns.png" alt="DNS packets captured in Wireshark"></p>
<p>The <em>packet no. 1</em> above is a DNS query asking for DNS A record (which will point to the IPv4 address of the server hosting the domain), and got the response(<em>packet no. 3</em>) as <code>No such name</code>(i.e NXDOMAIN as expected). Similarly, we can see that a query is made for DNS AAA record(similar to A record but points to IPv6 address) and got the response(<em>packet no. 10</em>) as <code>No such name</code>. So far, so good. But <em>packet no. 6</em> is a DNS query asking for the server IP of <strong>qwertyasdf123.in.domain[.]name</strong> which got a no error response that the domain name resolves to <code>78.47.226.171</code>. On visiting that IP address, I got redirected to the same website that I was being redirected to when I was visiting non-existent .in domains – parrz[.]com. I repeated these steps a few more times with different domains and every time an NXDOMAIN response is received for both A and AAA  record queries, a third query for A record of <code>&lt;domain&gt;.domain.name</code> is sent, where <code>&lt;domain&gt;</code> is the domain name I typed like <em>qwertyasdf123.in</em> or <em>qwertyasdf123.com</em>.<br>
Does <code>search domain.name</code> line in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> has got anything to do with it? Seems like it does. The resolv.conf <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/buster/manpages/resolv.conf.5.en.html">man page</a> says this about the search configuration:</p>
<pre><code>...
Resolver queries having fewer than ndots dots (default is 1) in them will be attempted using each component of the search path in turn until a match is found.
...
ndots:n
Sets a threshold for the number of dots which must appear in a name given to res_query(3) (see resolver(3)) before an initial absolute query will be made.  The default for n is 1, meaning that if there are any dots in a name, the name will be tried first as an absolute name before any search list elements are appended to it.  The value for this option is silently capped to 15.

</code></pre><p>After a couple of searches on the web, I figured out what that means – under the default case(when ndots option is not set), for resolving <code>example.com</code>, the resolver will try to resolve <code>example.com</code> first and if it fails, it’ll append search list domain(in this case <em>domain.name</em>) to it and try to resolve it. So in our case, when a query for the host address of <em>qwertyasdf123.in</em> results in an NXDOMAIN, the resolver will try to resolve <em>qwertyasdf123.in.domain.name</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.name">.name</a> is indeed a top-level domain extension just like .com or .org and someone might have brought domain.name and  configured a wildcard DNS record to redirect all <code>&lt;anything&gt;.domain.name</code> queries to a server filled with ads.<br>
I decided to figure out more about <em>domain.name</em> and confirm that it had a wildcard DNS record pointing to <code>78.47.226.171</code> before finding out how the <code>search domain.name</code> line got into my resolv.conf file. I ruled it out as something I might have carelessly configured during OS installation. I did <code>dig *.domain.name</code> and got:</p>
<pre><code>...
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 8453
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
...
</code></pre><p><code>status: NXDOMAIN</code> – that was an unexpected response, which means <em>*.domain.name</em> is a non-existent domain name. Well, it seems like .name allows third-level registrations(i.e <em>in.domain.name</em> and say, <em>com.domain.name</em> are separately registered) and <em>domain.name</em> is shared and cannot be registered individually. And <code>dig *.in.domain.name</code> returned:</p>
<pre><code>...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
*.in.domain.name.       898     IN      CNAME   in.domain.name.
in.domain.name.         897     IN      A       78.47.226.171
...
</code></pre><p>An A record pointing to <code>78.47.226.171</code> as expected. When I visited that address on my browser, the server responded with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302">302 redirect</a> to http://parrz[.]com/?dn=226.171 which contains some obfuscated JavaScript code that will either show ads or redirect the user to shady betting and trading websites. I decided to do a quick search on parrz[.]com and found a similar case on a <a href="https://comunidad.movistar.es/t5/Soporte-Fibra-y-ADSL/Se-redireccionan-los-dominios-es-que-no-existen/td-p/3988868#">Spanish ISP forum</a> – in which the user posted that visiting non-existing .es domains on both their laptop and android smartphone are redirected to parrz[.]com. They finally resolved the problem by replacing their router. With this new knowledge, I tried visiting <em>qwertyasdf123.in</em> on my android smartphone and it got redirected to the same parrz[.]com, hinting that the <code>domain.name</code> in resolv.conf is probably coming from my router. Furthermore, it showed that <em>es.domain.name</em> is also registered and redirects to parrz[.]com. I got a list of all <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozzi-/tld_scanner/master/ccTLDs.txt">ccTLDs</a> on a text file and ran the following bash commands to see how many such domains are registered:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat ccTLDs.txt | <span>while</span> read line; <span>do</span> dig <span>"</span>$line<span>.domain.name"</span> | tail -7 | head -1 | awk <span>'{ print $1 "\t" $5 }'</span>; <span>done</span> &gt; resolvedDomains.txt
</code></pre></div><p>which will try to resolve each domain extension in the list suffixed with <code>domain.name</code> and stores resolved IP address along with it into a file (resolvedDomains.txt) like this:</p>
<pre><code>AC.domain.name. 78.47.226.171
AD.domain.name. 78.47.226.171
AE.domain.name. 78.47.226.171
AF.domain.name. 78.47.226.171
...
</code></pre><p>Many domains are mapped to a few IP addresses, let’s see how many domains resolve to each using:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat resolvedDomains.txt | awk <span>'{ print $2  }'</span> | sort | uniq -c
</code></pre></div><p>which returned:</p>
<pre><code>11 
1 174.139.160.58
1 217.70.184.38
1 77.78.104.3
237 78.47.226.171
</code></pre><p>Almost all of them are pointed to <code>78.47.226.171</code> which redirects to parrz[.]com. All of the domains which points to it have <em>Gransy, s.r.o.</em> as the domain registrar so it is not clear whether these domains are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_parking">parked</a> or not. If not, <em>.domain.name</em> registration costs 14.70 USD on regtons[.]com(Gransy’s “domain solution” according to their website) and for 237 domain names, it would have cost them 3,483 USD per year.<br>
Parrz[.]com has an <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/parrz.com">Alexa rank</a> of around 40,000 in India, which is too much for a website that just shows shady advertisements. If so, I’m probably not alone in having this problem.<br>
Now the only question that remains is how <code>domain.name</code> got added in the search option of <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. After searching for a while, turns out that if the DHCP server(in this case my router) responds with either Option 15(Domain Name) or Option 119(Domain Search List) set, it is added to the search list. Time to <em>see</em> if that’s the case using Wireshark:
<img src="https://harigovind.org/img/content/article/nxdomain-hijacking/wireshark_dhcp.png" alt="DHCP DORA captured in Wireshark">
<em>Packet no. 76</em> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol#Offer">DHCP Offer</a> packet from the router and, as expected, has Option 15(Domain Name) set as <code>domain.name</code>. So it is indeed coming from the router and I found it in <code>Setup &gt; Local Network &gt; DHCP Server</code> as:
<img src="https://harigovind.org/img/content/article/nxdomain-hijacking/dlink_dhcp_settings.png" alt="Dlink DHCP settings page">
I replaced it with <code>dlink-home-network</code>, restarted the router and then visited some non-existent .in domain and instead of being redirected to ads about trading and betting, I got:
<img src="https://harigovind.org/img/content/article/nxdomain-hijacking/firefox_error.png" alt="Firefox error page">
Problem solved! I tried to find out if <code>domain.name</code> was the default value for that field for my router but didn’t find anything on the web. I asked some of my friends who have D-Link routers and while the newer ones had that field blank or the names <code>dlinkrouter</code> or just <code>dlink</code> some of the older models had <code>domain.name</code> just like me. These models were DSL 2730-U(firmware version IN_1.11 and IN_1.10) and DIR-600M(firmware version 3.04). Do check your router settings and if you have <code>domain.name</code> or anything ending with a valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">tld</a>, replace it with something like <code>my-home-network</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>In this article and the next, I'd like to share some ideas from the world of quantum probability.* The word "quantum" is pretty loaded, but don't let that scare you. We'll take a <em>first</em>—not second or third—look at the subject, and the only prerequisites will be linear algebra and basic probability. In fact, I like to think of quantum probability as another name for "linear algebra + probability," so this mini-series will explore the mathematics, rather than the physics, of the subject.** </p><p>In today's post, we'll motivate the discussion by saying a few words about (classical) probability. In particular, let's spend a few moments thinking about the following: <strong>‍</strong></p><figure id="w-node-09325bd40b58-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d25e9f12caf357c22edb8a1_slogan.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>What do I mean? We'll start with some basic definitions. Then I'll share an example that illustrates this idea.</p><p>A <strong>probability distribution </strong>(or simply,<strong> distribution</strong>) on a finite set $X$&nbsp;is a function $p \colon X\to [0,1]$ satisfying $\sum_x p(x) = 1$. I'll use the term <strong>joint probability distribution </strong>to refer to a distribution on a Cartesian product of finite sets, i.e. a function $p\colon X\times Y\to [0,1]$ satisfying $\sum_{(x,y)}p(x,y)=1$. Every joint distribution defines a <strong>marginal probability distribution </strong>on one of the sets by summing probabilities over the other set. For instance, the marginal distribution $p_X\colon X\to [0,1]$ on $X$ is defined by $p_X(x)=\sum_yp(x,y)$, in which the variable $y$ is summed, or "integrated," out.&nbsp;It's this very process of <em>summing </em>or<em> integrating out </em>that causes information to be lost. In other words, marginalizing loses information. It doesn't remember what was summed away!</p><p>I'll illustrate this with a simple example. To do so, I need to give you some finite sets $X$&nbsp;and $Y$ and a probability distribution on them.</p><p>Consider the set $S$ of all bitstrings of length three. Every bitstring begins with either a 0 or a 1, so we can think of $S$ as the Cartesian product of the set $X=\{0,1\}$ with the set of bitstrings of length two, $Y=\{00,11,01,10\}.$ It will be convenient to refer to elements in $X$&nbsp;as <strong>prefixes </strong>and to elements in $Y$&nbsp;as <strong>suffixes</strong>. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d21efb48b8308978dc2a0b6_bit3.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now we need a probability distribution on $S\cong X\times Y$ to work with. Let's suppose the probability of 011 is $\frac{3}{7}$, the probability of 110 is $\frac{2}{7}$, the probability of both 000 and 101 is $\frac{1}{7}$, and the probability of the other bitstrings is zero. So you can imagine a seven-sided die with the faces labeled as follows:</p><figure id="w-node-7a68df7747b2-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d30bb277df6872e209b7e5c_samples.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>One way to visualize this joint distribution is a weighted bipartite graph. <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs">We've explored this idea before.</a> The set of prefixes and suffixes define the two sets of vertices (ergo, <em>bipartite</em>). An edge connects a prefix and a suffix if their concatenation is one of the samples drawn. That edge is labeled with the corresponding probability (ergo, <em>weighted</em>). Yet another<em> </em>way to view the joint distribution is as a $2\times 4$ table. Rows are labeled by elements of $X$, columns are labeled by elements of&nbsp;$Y$, and the $xy$'th entry is the probability $p(x,y)$.</p><figure id="w-node-f2542fa1eb0d-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d27c337c6ffaa55a0d50b39_graph.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Marginal probabilities are easy to compute from a table: just sum along a row or column! For example, the probability of the suffix 00 is $p(00) = \frac{1}{7} + 0$.</p><figure id="w-node-82bf79caab98-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d21f4c1a8ae12e8882eebb4_marginal.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now here's the point I&nbsp;want to emphasize:</p><blockquote>Marginal probability is forgetful.</blockquote><ul role="list"><li>The marginal probability of the prefix 0 is $\frac{4}{7}$, but that number doesn't tell us that of the possible suffixes following 0, one is 00, three are 11, and none are 01 or 10.</li><li>The marginal probability of the prefix 1 is $\frac{3}{7}$, but that number doesn't tell us that of the possible suffixes following 1, one is 01, two are 10, and none are 00 or 11.</li></ul><p>In other words, summing over the suffixes in $Y$ has caused us to lose all information from $Y$ in a totally irreparable way. It cannot be recovered. There's no going back. This is what I&nbsp;meant by "marginal probability doesn't have memory." It's just a feature of probability.</p><p><em>And this is where the fun begins.</em></p><p>I'm now going to introduce a<em> different</em> way to compute the marginals from a joint distribution. It can be thought of as "marginal probability with memory." When computing marginal probabilities in this new way, you'll have ready access to the information lost in the old way! </p><p>The ideas are simple, though they might feel unmotivated at first. Bear with me. I want to show you something nice. Afterwards I'll explain what's going on. </p><h2>Here's a better way...</h2><p>Again, we'll start with the joint distribution. As we know, it can be viewed as a $2\times 4$ table. Here it is again:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d21f58c32e32e11ce530892_M.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>You see I've made some small cosmetic changes. The $2\times 4$ table is now a $2\times 4$ matrix, and I've judiciously added some square roots. You may ignore them if you like. I've included them for math reasons that we needn't worry about now. Lastly, I've given the matrix a name, $M$.</p><p>Let's now multiply $M$&nbsp;by its transpose:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d21f82132e32e31b3536e61_MM.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>This matrix&nbsp;is <em>very </em>interesting. For one, it's a $4\times 4$ matrix. The set $Y$ has four elements in it and we can identify them with the rows/columns of this matrix. This sets the stage for another observation: <strong>the diagonal of $M^\top M$ contains the marginal probability distribution on $Y$.</strong></p><figure id="w-node-5f7cda990323-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d21f82e46a537ec3e02c3eb_MM2.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>So we've just computed marginal probability by multiplying a matrix by its transpose.</p><p>Voila.</p><p><em>But wait, there's more.</em></p><p>The off-diagonals of $M^\top M$ are also interesting. <em>Some are non-zero</em>. Let's not focus on their values for now (although they convey rich information). Let's just appreciate their existence: the fact that $M^\top M$&nbsp;has non-zero off-diagonals means that it has interesting eigenvectors. It's a rank 2 matrix, so it has two eigenvectors. Here they are:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5d24076c5b4151dac30fb59e_evects.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Interesting indeed!&nbsp;<strong>The square of the entries of these eigenvectors define conditional probability distributions on the set of suffixes, $Y$.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, the first eigenvector defines a probability distribution on $Y$, conditioned on $0$ being the prefix of a bitstring. Concretely: given that 0 is the prefix of a bitstring $s=(x,y)\in X\times Y$, the suffix $y$&nbsp;will be 00 with probability $\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4}$, it will be 11 with probability $\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}\right)^2=\frac{3}{4}$, and it will be 01 and 10 each with probability $0^2=0$. This is the information contained in the entries of the first eigenvector. The second eigenvector likewise defines a probability distribution on $Y$, conditioned on the prefix $x=1$. </p><blockquote>The information contained in the eigenvectors is precisely the information that's destroyed after computing marginal probability in the usual way.</blockquote><p>But we're not done! We multiplied $M$ by its transpose on the left. If you switch the order, you'll see that the $2\times 2$ matrix $MM^\top$ has the marginal distribution on the set of prefixes $X$&nbsp;along its diagonal, and that its eigenvectors define conditional probabilities on $X$ after squaring the entries.</p><p>So $M^\top M$ has the marginals of $Y$ along its diagonal. And the existence of non-zero off-diagonals imply that its eigenvectors contain conditional probabilistic information; $MM^\top$&nbsp;contains the same for $X$. Together, these two matrices recover all the information from the original joint distribution—something that can't be done when marginalizing in the usual way.</p><p><em>Excellent.</em></p><p>So, what's going on?</p><blockquote>The matrices $M^\top M$&nbsp;and $MM^\top$&nbsp;are the quantum versions of marginal probability distributions.</blockquote><p><em>What does that mean?</em></p><p>I'll explain next time. </p><p>But here's a sneak peak:</p><p>The quantum version of a probability distribution is something called a <em>density operator</em>. The quantum version of marginalizing corresponds to "reducing" that operator to a subsystem. This&nbsp;reduction is a construction in linear algebra called the partial trace. In <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/a-first-look-at-quantum-probability-part-2">Part 2</a> of this miniseries, I'll begin by explaining the partial trace. Then I'll explain what I mean by "quantum version." Along the way, we'll unwind the basics of quantum probability theory.</p><p>Until then!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>*This mini-series is based on recent talks I gave at Smith College, the CUNY&nbsp;Graduate Center, and the EDGE/PRiME colloquium at Pomona College.</p><p>**When I started Math3ma in 2015, I wanted some aspect of the site to reflect my ever-present admiration for physics. This is why the logo is an "M" surrounded by little electrons. Four years later, I'm happy to (finally!) write about mathematical physics.</p><p><em>Sincere thanks to John Terilla for inspiring and providing feedback for this mini-series.</em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Three industries have come to dominate a disproportionate amount of students' attention on Ivy League campuses: finance, big tech, and consulting. When you subtract out the students attending grad school or who don't immediately enter the workforce, nearly half choose one of these fields.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Why?</p><h3>Why the Big Three?</h3><p>The simplest explanation is money. The Big Three offer a higher salary on average than other industries, attracting a greater number of students. However, many companies outside tech, consulting, and finance recruit on elite college campuses too, garnering little attention from students. For example, several consumer packaged goods companies recruit through Harvard's on-campus recruiting program offering compensation similar to entry-level management consulting, but they are seldom the talk of campus. Money alone fails to explain the concentration in the Big Three.</p><p>Neither is it interest. The average Harvard student would probably prefer to work on Google Maps over Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, but this doesn't explain why students focus on a narrow set of companies <em>within</em> an industry as well. Recruitment for consulting centers almost entirely on three firms: McKinsey, Bain, &amp; BCG. The work and compensation at a boutique consulting firm doesn't differ substantially, yet these three command almost all the attention of elite students' recruiting for management consulting.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> Holding interest constant, students' decisions are still quite clustered in a few firms.</p><p>Often, these firms are simply described as "better." But by which metric? There are <a href="https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/consulting/vault-consulting-rankings-top-50">rankings</a> of course, but most are able to cite the top three three without needing a sophisticated methodology.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> They just know that these firms are the best but not why. By better, what people really mean is that these firms are more prestigious.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> This same emphasis on a few firms takes place in other industries too. Goldman Sachs and Blackstone are favored over small finance shops. Google and Facebook over startups. This is not because these companies are more interesting or necessarily more lucrative to work for; they are simply "better" in the eyes of students.</p><p>Prestige is a measure of how much better. It acts as a funnel that shapes not only the industries students pursue but also the companies within those industries they choose. And ambitious students, if they're not careful, can find themselves following the path of least resistance without considering whether or not prestige actually serves them.</p><h3>Peer Pressure</h3><p>Prestige is a form of peer pressure that influences one's decisions on what to work on and how to value things. When I hear people talk about peer pressure, I conjure up images of high schoolers cajoling one another into smoking weed. I blame the regular <a href="https://dare.org/">D.A.R.E.</a> workshops that my elementary school hosted several times a year that encouraged us to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Say_No">just say no</a>." But the peer pressure behind prestige is subtler. No one will ever explicitly ask you to take one of these jobs. The only person you will ever have to say no to is yourself.</p><p>When I first arrived to Harvard, I was taken aback by the degree to which prestige was everyone's measuring stick of choice. In hindsight, I'm not sure why my 18-year-old self was surprised that a university which prides itself on external prestige would be controlled internally by similar forces. I made the same mistake most do when they reason formally about smart people: they assume their intelligence insulates them from peer pressure.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p><p>Prestige, like peer pressure, outsources your decision making. But are others better equipped to make a decision about your future than yourself? Instead of making an independent decision based upon the facts, you come to rely upon the opinion of the crowd.</p><p>This explains why I was so confused about career conversations with my peers in the past. My baseline assumption was that they rationally evaluated all jobs available to them and then made a decision about where to work. In reality, most did the opposite. They already knew where they wanted to work and then developed their reasons <em>ex post facto</em>.</p><h3>The Roots of Prestige</h3><p>Prestige is not an immutable quality inherent to a company, but rather a product of one's social environment. There are many college students who would love to work for a Silicon Valley startup, but I know of few Harvard students who'd prefer startups over big tech. This isn't an economic decision—recruits of later-stage startups can command the same or even better compensation than FAANG while also guaranteeing stability—but I've never heard of a Harvard CS major wanting to work for Stripe.<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> This is surprising since Stripe is very prestigious <em>within</em> the Valley itself. What's prestigious in one place isn't necessarily prestigious in another, as social environments vary.</p><p>The best <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">critique</a> for prestige I've seen so far comes from Paul Graham:</p><blockquote><p>"Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll <em>make</em> it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself."</p></blockquote><p>Prestige is just a heuristic for replicating the success of those that inspire us in our own social environment. The Big Three represent "fossilized inspirations" of incredibly successful individuals for many elite students. These same ambitious students, wanting success themselves, seek out prestige thinking it is the missing ingredient to excellence. But this is a fatally flawed formula. Exposure to prestige can't make you successful any more than spending time around rich people can make you wealthy.<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup></p><p>It is the excellence of the individuals behind the organization that make it prestigious, not the other way around. Harvard is an excellent university because its students are excellent not because it made them that way. If it were the inverse, there wouldn't be such an emphasis on selectiveness in admissions since the institution could simply make its students world class. Any random group of eighteen-year-olds would suffice. But we know this not to be true. That is why the prestigious are obsessed with selecting for excellence in their recruits—their brand depends upon it.</p><h3>Goodhart's Law</h3><p>Why don't more people realize that prestige is just a byproduct of success? The simplest explanation is that we overfit with our pattern matching. We see so many successful individuals in one domain that have a resume that looks a particular way, and we assume our resume must look the same. Because these opportunities are often time-limited and scarce, and given the environments in which they appear are often competing for individuals' attention with many other demands, we don't have the chance to figure out what really underpins success in general, much less in a specific context or industry. It's easier to take the consensus path that seems to have worked for others in the past. It's easier to just use the heuristic.</p><p>But there's more to it than that. We've begun to conflate prestige with success itself, skewing the incentives entirely. This is something Harvard students understand intuitively. For most Ivy Leaguers, the most impressive thing they've accomplished is to achieve admission to their university. When you're deemed successful because you went to Harvard rather than celebrated for what got you there in the first place, you learn to game the system. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law">Goodhart's Law</a> in action.</p><p>We see this in hiring practices too. It's difficult for companies to measure talent directly, so they often evaluate a candidate by their credentials instead. Tech is relatively egalitarian, with many companies turning to whiteboard interviews and portfolios to rate candidates. Finance and consulting are much less forgiving with a strong emphasis on pedigree.</p><p>The more this dynamic of credentialism takes place, the stronger the incentive there is to optimize for prestige and forego individual excellence. Ideally, every university and company has a perfect selection process and no one's credentials would go unearned. In reality, these processes are imperfect and inevitably individuals will leverage their credentials regardless their underlying abilities.</p><p>Elite college students are a good bellwether for prestige's prominence in society. The most ambitious are intimately familiar with what got them there, not the qualities they're supposed to be measured for. My personal experience suggests that the prestige problem is already quite bad and is only getting worse. What does this mean for society?</p><h3>The Hollowness of Prestige</h3><p>One obvious implication of a focus on prestige is that it may be reducing our collective excellence. If chasing prestige is an ineffective way to achieve true excellence, then it follows that this strategy may be reducing the number of individuals who are actually successful. What's worrisome is that because we conflate prestige with success itself, we may not even notice this is happening.</p><p>An overreliance on prestige also shuts out the less privileged. Prestige-driven hiring practices and a focus on pedigree is the most harmful to the individuals that can't obtain prestige in the first place. Thankfully, elite universities are increasingly egalitarian and diverse in the students they admit, but they are still not representative. People are being left behind and their talents wasted.</p><p>But worst of all, the most harrowing implications of a prestige-driven society are on the individual level. While recruiters may confuse a Stanford degree for evidence of world-class programming skills, the candidate won't. We know when we're optimizing for credentials vs. pursuing excellence  for its own sake. There is something deeply fulfilling about the latter and rather unsatisfying about the former.</p><p>Just as choosing a job based on prestige outsources our decision to the crowd, relying upon credentials for fulfillment relegates our happiness to the opinion of others. Inevitably, you'll never …</p></section></div>

    <p><strong>tty</strong> (short for <strong>t</strong>ele<strong>ty</strong>pe) is a Unix command that prints the name of the terminal connected to standard input. It is also the prefix in names for virtual terminals on Unix-based operating systems.</p>
<p>The fundamental type of application that runs on a terminal is the <strong>shell</strong>. The shell prompts for commands from the user and sends it for execution after they press Enter, similar to the old teletype workflow.</p>

            /
    display

</code></pre>

<p>Based on intuition, the whole shebang looks like the diagram above. Keyboard passes input to the terminal, that passes it to the process, the process does some work and gives the output back to the terminal, that prints it on the display.</p>
<pre><code>
    keyboard
            \
             \ input
              \
            (terminal)- -(termios)- -(process)
              /
             / output
            /
    display

</code></pre>

<p>But, an <em>illusion</em> sits between the terminal and the process.</p>
<h2>termios and stty</h2>
<p><code>termios</code> is an interface to some default settings that affect how text is entered and printed on a terminal.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ man termios

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>man</code> page for <code>termios</code> shows all the available settings.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ stty -a
  speed 38400 baud; rows 34; columns 166; line = 0;
  intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D;
  -ignbrk brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr
  opost -olcuc -ocrnl onlcr -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel nl0 cr0
  isig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>stty</code> utility can be used to turn these settings on or off. An <code>stty -a</code> shows all the default settings and their values. For example, the speed of serial communication, and the number of rows and columns.</p>
<p>Let's see what some of these settings do. We'll go through the same examples Brandon Rhodes shared in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrMnmLyYjU8">2017 North Bay Python keynote</a>.</p>
<h3>icanon</h3>
<pre><code>
  $ man termios
  ...
      ICANON Enable canonical mode (described below).
  ...

</code></pre>

<p>The first one is <code>icanon</code>, which is on by default. It refers to the canonical text editor, that buffers input to allow basic text editing of commands. For example, moving the cursor back and forth, or removing characters using backspace. Interactive applications like text editors turn off <code>icanon</code> and handle all the text editing themselves.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ stty -icanon

</code></pre>

<p>We can turn off <code>icanon</code> using <code>stty -icanon</code>, <code>-</code> being the off switch. This is how <code>stty</code> works, the utility name; <code>-</code> for off, no <code>-</code> for on, with the setting name.</p>
<p>Let's open <code>cat</code> and type in some text. Since the canonical text editor is on by default, we can see that the input is buffered till Enter is pressed. We can also use backspace to remove characters from our input. Let's see how the terminal behaves when <code>icanon</code> is off.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/icanon.gif">
</p>

<p>We can see that the text is not being buffered for editing. <code>cat</code> receives a character as soon we type it and prints it right away, rather than one line at a time. To turn on <code>icanon</code>, we just remove the <code>-</code> and run <code>stty icanon</code>.</p>
<h3>onlcr</h3>
<pre><code>
  $ man termios
  ...
      ONLCR  (XSI) Map NL to CR-NL on output.
  ...

</code></pre>

<p>The second one is <code>onlcr</code>, which is on by default. Here nl stands for new line and cr for carriage return. <code>onlcr</code> finds new lines in text and adds a carriage return to each one. A carriage return makes sure that the cursor moves back to the first column after a new line. Similar to the teletype days, when the <em>paper carriage</em> would <em>return</em> to the first column after a new line.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/tty-function.gif">
</p>

<p>A carriage return, without the new line character, is used to make progress bars on modern terminals. The program updates the progress, moves the cursor back to the first column, and then overwrites the earlier progress with the new one.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ stty -onlcr

</code></pre>

<p>We can turn it off using <code>stty -onlcr</code>. Let's see the output for <code>ps</code>, a utility that reports the status of the current processes. The output looks very structured. Let's turn off <code>onclr</code> and see the output again.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/onlcr.gif">
</p>

<p>It's all over the place! The illusion is gone, this is the real thing. Each line is being printed on a new line but the cursor does not return to the first column. A lot of applications are written with this assumption, that the terminal will move the cursor back to the first column, automatically, when a new line is printed.</p>
<h3>echo</h3>
<pre><code>
  $ man termios
  ...
      ECHO   Echo input characters.
  ...

</code></pre>

<p>The third one is <code>echo</code>, which is also on by default. It directs the terminal to print every character that we input, back on the display.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ stty -echo

</code></pre>

<p>We can turn it off using <code>stty -echo</code>. We'll look at <code>cat</code> again. We can see the input text being typed. What happens if we turn it off?</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/echo.gif">
</p>

<p>We didn't see <code>cat</code> and the input text being typed. Until <code>cat</code>, which was actually running, printed them for us. Programs turn off <code>echo</code> when they ask the users for sensitive input, like passwords.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ reset

</code></pre>

<p>If you're experimenting with <code>termios</code> settings, you can use the reset command to return all of them to their default values.</p>
<pre><code>
  import termios

</code></pre>

<p>The Python standard library also contains the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/termios.html">termios</a> module that can be used to turn these settings on or off from Python code.</p>
<h2>Signals</h2>
<p>Another way to change a terminal's state is through in-band and out-of-band signals. In-band signaling means we throw in some special characters in our text input, that the terminal interprets as commands. It does not print these special characters but instead causes the intended effect.</p>
<h3>Control characters</h3>
<p>One way to do in-band signaling is using control characters. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>^H</strong> backspace</li>
<li><strong>^J</strong> add a new line</li>
<li><strong>^C</strong> interrupt the running process</li>
<li><strong>^D</strong> end text input or exit the shell</li>
</ul>
<h3>Escape sequences</h3>
<p>Another way is to use escape sequences, that control things like cursor location and text color. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\u001b[2J</code>: clear screen</li>
<li><code>\u001b[1m</code>: make text bold</li>
<li><code>\u001b[31m</code>: make text red</li>
<li><code>\u001b[{n}A</code>: moves cursor up by n</li>
</ul>
<p>Printing each escape sequence will have the corresponding effect.</p>
<h2>Streams</h2>
<p>Terminals are also preconfigured with input and output streams, where input stream is mapped to the keyboard, and output stream to the display.</p>
<p>This ability to automatically map input and output to the keyboard and display, by default, was a Unix breakthrough! In operating systems before Unix, programs had to explicitly connect to appropriate input-output devices, which was a tedious thing to do, because of a lack of standards across systems.</p>
<h3>stdin</h3>
<p>stdin is the input stream, where the program reads its input data.</p>
<h3>stdout and stderr</h3>
<p>stdout and stderr are output streams, where the program writes its output data and error messages.</p>
<h2>Redirection</h2>
<p>Program output can also be redirected using the redirection operators.</p>
<h3>&gt; and &gt;&gt;</h3>
<pre><code>
  $ echo "hello" &gt; file
  $ echo "world" &gt;&gt; file

</code></pre>

<p>The greater than (<code>&gt;</code>) and the double greater than (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) are operators that redirect a program's output to a file. The only difference between the two is that <code>&gt;</code> will overwrite the file, while <code>&gt;&gt;</code> will append to the file.</p>
<h3>|</h3>
<pre><code>
  $ echo "hello" | cat
  hello

</code></pre>

<p>Another redirection operator is the pipe that makes the output of one program the input to another.</p>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of how terminals evolved and how they work, let's look at programs that run inside a terminal.</p>
<h2>Command-line interfaces</h2>
<p>The words interfaces, applications, programs and tools are used interchangeably, but they refer to the same thing most of the time. CLIs are kinda fun to use and make it easy to automate repetitive tasks via shell scripting!</p>
<pre><code>
  Prompt command option argument &lt;Enter&gt;
  Output

</code></pre>

<p>The general usage pattern of a CLI looks like above. The shell displays the prompt as a sign that it's ready to take in commands. The users type in the command that they want to run, along with options, and arguments. Finally ending the input by pressing the Enter key. This completes the <em>command line</em> of text. The command is then executed and output is printed on the terminal. But what are these arguments and options?</p>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>Arguments are <em>required</em> items of information for a program. Required, in the sense that the program won't work without them. They are often <em>positional</em>, which means an argument's position in the line helps the program identify the argument's type.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ cp src dst

</code></pre>

<p>For example, here's the <code>cp</code> command. It can't function without both the <em>required</em> arguments. The argument in the first position will always be identified as source, and the argument in the second position will always be the destination where files from source need to be copied.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>An option, or a flag, is used to modify the operation of a command. As the name suggests, they are optional and have some default values. The general convention is to have hyphen(s) in front of a character or word to identify the option.</p>
<pre><code>
  $ cp -r src dst

</code></pre>

<p>For example, in the <code>cp</code> command, <code>-r</code> changes the operation by recursively looking for files in the source, and then copying them to the destination.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>One of the criticisms of a CLI is the lack of cues to the user about the available actions, in contrast to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> that usually inform the user of available actions with menus, icons, or other visual cues.</p>
<h3>Help text</h3>
<pre><code>
  $ cp --help

</code></pre>

<p>To overcome this limitation, many CLI programs display some documentation around the arguments and options that they support. This documentation can be viewed by invoking the CLI with the <code>--help</code> option.</p>
<h3>Manual pages</h3>
<pre><code>
  $ man termios

</code></pre>

<p>Some of them also have man pages (short for manual page). By default, the <code>man</code> Unix command uses a terminal pager program such as <code>more</code> or <code>less</code> to display the large documentation for a CLI. This makes it easy for the user to scroll and search through it.</p>
<h2>Standards</h2>
<p>You must be wondering that there's a lot of moving parts here. Each programmer could write their CLI differently. For example, they could use <code>-x</code> instead of <code>-h</code> to display help text. Are there any standards to make sure every CLI follows some basic conventions?</p>
<h3>POSIX</h3>
<p>There is a standard and it's called POSIX. …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>
What is it?</h2>
<p><b><i><a href="https://www.deta.sh/" target="_blank">Deta</a></i></b> is the easiest cloud platform for developers. Deta is on a mission to form web development sane. To bring simplicity &amp; the enjoyment of coding back to the online. With the advancement of technology and new concept booming day by day, it's not as easy to find out and implement everything.</p>

<p>
It&nbsp;jogs my memory&nbsp;of <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>&nbsp;but deta's documentation and solutions that it's offering at the time of writing are mindblowing.</p>

<h2>
Why it matters?</h2>
<p>
Deta makes the hectic task of app deployment easy. While firebase seems to be a simple alternative for an equivalent. But it's not. The last time I attempted Firebase was to implement user authentication via SMS and that I was unable to attain the goal, though I even have followed the documentation thoroughly.</p>

<p>
From the deta site:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Your first programming lesson taught you how to print "Hello, World". Then you learned how to use functions, then libraries and frameworks. Then you decide to make a website and then... 😭<br>
‍<br>
Programming for the web is complex world of interlinked concepts and technologies, not always easy to grasp . From Servers to Databases to Caching, to CDNs to Load balancers, etc.&nbsp;</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Deta team's mission is to make web development sane. To bring simplicity &amp; the joy of coding back to the web.</b></blockquote>
<p>
At the time of the scripting of this article, Deta is providing two great solutions for the developers while two more are going to release soon. <a href="https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home/#deta-base" target="_blank">Deta base</a> - a production-ready NoSQL database which will handle complex queries and searches and <a href="https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home/#deta-micros" target="_blank">Deta Micros</a> - a CLI powered service that helps you to deploy your NODE.JS and Python apps easily. This suggests that further, you do not need YAML files or Docker.</p>

<h2>
Use Cases:</h2>
<p>
Deta can be used to make side projects and experiments, a micro SaaS, in hackathons and education field the possibilities are higher. It just needs your imagination and tool you are going to build.</p>
<h2>
Questions and Answer:</h2>
<p><b>Q: Does Deta provide free tier?</b><br>
A: Yes, it does provide a free tier limited to possess one team member, unlimited databases, 2GB storage, 25k requests/month (for deta base). While, it provides unlimited micros, 50k requests/month, and 100 emails/day under Deta Micros service.</p><p>

<b>Q: How it's different from Firebase or Docker?</b><br>
A: The simplest answer shall be its easy documentation and you do not need anything aside from its CLI.</p><p>

<b>Q: How to use the service?</b><br>
A: Refer to the <a href="https://docs.deta.sh/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p><p>

In my humble opinion, app deployment on Docker or Firebase may be a very hectic task as per my experience. When I listened about deta from one of my friends. After referring to the documentation, I used to be use the service without effort. Since I'm not an expert within the cloud platform topic, I'm just guessing, that the service that deta is offering is just simply amazing and straightforward to know.</p></div>

<div><p>
In the next post, I will be able to show you ways to make a little poll app with the deta.</p><h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>TL;DR – The SanDisk High Endurance cards use SanDisk/Toshiba <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wd-sandisk-bics3-64-layer-3d-nand,32328.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D TLC Flash</a>. It took way, way more work than it should have to figure this out (thanks for nothing, SanDisk!).</strong></p><p>In a <a href="https://ripitapart.com/2019/08/17/unboxing-and-review-of-sandisk-64gb-microsdxc-high-endurance-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blog post</a>, I took a look at SanDisk’s microSD cards that were aimed for use in write-intensive applications like dash cameras. In that post I took a look at its performance metrics, and speculated about what sort of NAND Flash memory is used inside. SanDisk doesn’t publish any detailed specifications about the cards’ internal workings, so that means I have no choice but to reverse-engineer the <del>can of worms</del> card myself.</p><p>In the hopes of uncovering more information, I sent an email to SanDisk’s support team asking about what type of NAND Flash they are using in their High Endurance lineup of cards, alongside endurance metrics like P/E (Program/Erase) cycle counts and total terabytes written (TBW). Unfortunately, the SanDisk support rep couldn’t provide a satisfactory answer to my questions, as they’re not able to provide any information that’s not listed in their public spec sheets. They said that all of their cards use MLC Flash, which I guess is correct if you call TLC Flash 3-bit MLC (which Samsung does).</p><div>
<blockquote><p>Dear Jason,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting SanDisk® Global customer care. We really appreciate you being a part of our SanDisk® family.</p>
<p>I understand that you wish to know more about the SanDisk® High Endurance video monitoring card, as such please allow me to inform you that all our SanDisk® memory cards uses Multi level cell technology (MLC) flash. However, the read/write cycles for the flash memory is not published nor documented only the read and write speed in published as such they are 100 MB/S &amp; 40 MB/s. The 64 GB card can record Full HD video up to 10,000 hours. To know more about the card you may refer to the link below:</p>

<p>I’ll give them a silver star that says “You Tried” at least.</p>

<p>While (micro)SD cards feel like a solid monolithic piece of technology, they’re made up of multiple different chips, each performing a different role. A basic SD card will have a controller that manages the NAND Flash chips and communicates with the host (PC, camera, etc.), and the NAND Flash itself (made up of 1 or more Flash dies). Bunnie Huang’s blog, Bunnie Studios, has an excellent article on the internals of SD cards, including counterfeits and how they’re made – check it out <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>MicroSD cards often (but not always!) include test pads, used to program/test the NAND Flash during manufacture. These can be exploited in the case of <a href="https://blog.acelaboratory.com/pc-3000-flash-monolith-pinout-research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data recovery</a>, or to reuse microSD cards that have a defective controller or firmware by turning the card into a piece of raw NAND Flash – check out Gough Lui’s adventures <a href="https://goughlui.com/2015/04/05/teardown-optimization-comsol-8gb-usb-flash-stick-au6989sn-gt-sdtnrcama-008g/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Note that there is no set standard for these test pads (even for the same manufacturer!), but there are common patterns for some manufacturers like SanDisk that make reverse-engineering easier.</p>

<p>microSD cards fall into a category of “monolithic” Flash devices, as they combine a controller and raw NAND Flash memory into a single, inseparable package. Many manufacturers break out the Flash’s data bus onto hidden (and nearly completely undocumented) test pads, which some other memory card and USB drive manufacturers take advantage of to make cheap storage products using failed parts; the controller can simply be electrically disabled and the Flash is then used as if it were a regular chip.</p>
<p>In the case of SanDisk cards, there is very limited information on their cards’ test pad pinouts. Each generation has slight differences, but the layout is mostly the same. These differences can be fatal, as the power and ground connections are sometimes reversed (this spells instant death for a chip if its power polarity is mixed up!).</p>
<p>My card (and many of their higher-end cards – that is, not their Ultra lineup) features test pads that aren’t covered by solder mask, but are instead covered by some sort of screen-printed epoxy with a laser-etched serial number on top. With a bit of heat and some scraping, I was able to remove the (very brittle) coating on top of the test pads; this also removed the serial number which I believe is an anti-tamper measure by SanDisk.</p>

		
		

<p>After cleaning off any last traces of the epoxy coating, I was greeted with the familiar SanDisk test pad layout, plus a few extra on the bottom.</p>

<p>The breakout board is relatively simple in concept: for each test pad, bring out a wire that goes to a bigger test point for easier access, and wire up the normal SD bus to an SD connector to let the controller do its work with twiddling the NAND Flash bus. Given how small each test pad is (and how many), things get a bit… messy.</p>

		
		

<p>I started by using double-side foam adhesive tape to secure the SD card to a piece of perfboard. I then tinned all of the pads and soldered a small 1uF ceramic capacitor across the card’s power (Vcc) and ground (GND) test pads. Using 40-gauge (0.1 mm, or 4-thousandths of an inch!) magnet wire, I mapped each test pad to its corresponding machine-pin socket on the perfboard. Including the extra test pads, that’s a total of 28 tiny wires!</p>
<p>For the SD connector side of things, I used a flex cable for the <a href="http://xtc2clip.org/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XTC 2 Clip</a> (a tool used to service HTC Android devices), as it acted as a flexible “remote SD card” and broke out the signals to a small ribbon cable. I encased the flex cable with copper tape to act as a shield against electrical noise and to provide physical reinforcement, and soldered the tape to the outer pads on the perfboard for reinforcement. The ribbon cable end was then tinned and each SD card’s pin was wired up with magnet wire. The power lines were then broken out to an LED and resistor to indicate when the card was receiving power.</p>

<p>With all of the test pads broken out to an array of test pins, it was time to make sense of what pins are responsible for accessing the NAND Flash inside the card.</p>

<p>The overall test pad pinout was the same for other microSD cards from SanDisk, but there were some differences, primarily regarding the layout of the power pads; notably, <strong>the</strong> <strong>main power pins are backwards</strong>! This can destroy the card if you’re not careful when applying power.</p>
<p>I used my <a href="https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/shop/logic-analyzer/dslogic-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSLogic Plus</a> logic analyzer to analyze the signals on all of the pins. Since the data pinout was previously discovered, the hard part of figuring out what each line represented (data bus, control, address, command, write-protect, ready/busy status) was already done for me. However, not all of the lines were immediately evident as the pinouts I found online only included the bare minimum of lines to make the NAND Flash accessible, with one exception being a control line that places the controller into a reset state and releases its control of the data lines (this will be important later on).</p>
<p>By sniffing the data bus at the DSLogic’s maximum speed (and using its 32 MB onboard buffer RAM), I was able to get a clear snapshot of the commands being sent to the NAND Flash from the controller during initialization.</p>
<h2>Bus Sniffing &amp; NAND I/O 101 (writing commands, address, reading data)</h2>
<p>In particular, I was looking for two commands: RESET (0xFF), and READ ID (0x90). When looking for a command sequence, it’s important to know how and when the data and control lines change. I will try to explain it step-by-step, but if you’re interested there is an <a href="https://user.eng.umd.edu/~blj/CS-590.26/micron-tn2919.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introductory white paper</a> by Micron that explains all of the fundamentals of NAND Flash with much more information about how NAND Flash works.</p>

		
		

<p>When a RESET command is sent to the NAND Flash, first the /CE (Chip Select, Active Low) line is pulled low. Then the CLE (Command Latch Enable) line is pulled high; the data bus is set to its intended value of 0xFF (all binary ones); then the /WE (Write Enable, Active Low) line is pulsed from high to low, then back to high again (the data bus’ contents are committed to the chip when the /WE line goes from low to high, known as a “rising edge”); the CLE line is pulled back low to return to its normal state. The Flash chip will then pull its R/B (Ready/Busy Status) line low to indicate it is busy resetting itself, then releases the line back to its high state when it’s finished.</p>
<p>The READ ID command works similarly, except after writing the command with 0x90 (binary 1001 0000) on the data bus, it then pulls the ALE (Address Latch Enable) line high instead of CLE, and writes 0x00 (all binary zeroes) by pulsing the /WE line low. The chip transfers its internally programmed NAND Flash ID into its internal read register, and the data is read out from the device on each rising edge of the /RE (Read Enable, Active Low) line; for most devices this is 4 to 8 bytes of data.</p>
<h2>NAND Flash ID</h2>
<p>For each NAND Flash device, it has a (mostly) unique ID that identifies the manufacturer, and other functional data that is defined by that manufacturer; in other words, only the manufacturer ID, assigned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEDEC Technology Association</a>, is well-defined.</p>
<p>The first byte represents the Flash manufacturer, and the rest (2 to 6 bytes) define the device’s characteristics, as set out by the manufacturer themselves. Most NAND vendors are very tight-lipped when it comes to datasheets, and SanDisk (and by extension, Toshiba/Kioxia) maintain very strict control, save for some slightly outdated leaked Toshiba datasheets. Because the two aforementioned companies share their NAND fabrication facilities, we can reasonably presume the data structures in the vendor-defined bytes can be referenced against each other.</p>
<p>In the case of the SanDisk High Endurance 128GB card, it has a NAND Flash ID of 0x45 48 9A B3 7E 72 0D 0E. Some of these values can be compared against a <a href="http://www.datasheet.hk/view_download.php?id=2027929&amp;file=0515%5Ctc58teg5dcjtai0_7779332.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toshiba datasheet</a>:</p>

    <p>When considering other engineering disciplines, engineers rarely build the product. In electrical engineering, the product design is specified in ECAD, exported, and then assembled by a mix of robots and technicians. Similarly, mechanical engineering specifies the product design in CAD, exports it to a set of drawings, and then it is built and assembled by technicians.</p>
<p>Software, however, does not have technicians. There is no separation between the specification of the product design by the engineer and the actual product that is used by the end-user (At least, there is no additional role between the specification and the end result, because arguably the compiler or interpreter acts as the technician and turns the code into bytes used by the computer). This is fantastic, because it cuts down on costs and the lead time of products. But, I believe it has had a profound, negative effect on software engineering as a whole.</p>
<p>Unlike most other engineering disciplines, software engineering is complete and utter garbage. This is sadly not a controversial opinion. What is up for debate is why software is just so bad. I believe the sorry state of software engineering is not due to how young it is, or how different it is from other engineering disciplines, but almost entirely due to the missing technician role. The existence of this role forces the engineer to properly specify the parameters of the product, otherwise it is built improperly or it is outright rejected. If an electrical engineer takes hundreds of tries tweaking a PCB specification, then they are a terrible engineer and would be promptly fired. Yet software has completely normalized this way of working.</p>
<p>Clearly it hasn't all collapsed (yet), so obviously something about software works. We can easily see why by looking at one of the other, young engineering disciplines: electrical engineering.</p>
<h2 id="the-breadboard-ecad-and-the-engineer">The Breadboard, ECAD, and the Engineer<a href="#the-breadboard-ecad-and-the-engineer" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-breadboard-ecad-and-the-engineer">🔗</a>
</h2>
<p>I was originally an electrical engineer. Starting out, I learned how to use a breadboard. A breadboard is a brilliant and simple piece of technology. It consists of a grid of holes where each row is connected together electrically. It makes experimenting with LEDs, diodes, switches and batteries easy and effortless. With an Arduino you can bring a microcontroller into the mix and build exciting new things.</p>
<p>As with everything, sometimes the circuit that you've built on the breadboard doesn't work. Thankfully, it is trivial to add a wire or two and hook up an oscilloscope or multimeter and start probing various connections. Sometimes the issue is as simple as a diode being backwards, which can be quickly rectified. Sometimes it is something more complicated, but everything is exposed and easily checked so you can trace it down.</p>
<p>Breadboards are easy to get started with, are extremely flexible, and can be effortless inspected with a variety of tools. But they also have downsides. They are big; wires can come loose or just be in the wrong spot; they are time consuming to recreate; and sometimes they are just a rats nest of wires and impossible to debug.</p>
<p>Eventually I was required to learn an ECAD system. Specifically, I had to learn Altium. This is a horrendously complicated piece of software which is used to design PCBs. Instead of having a simple grid that I could plug things into, I now had to design a schematic and then design a PCB layout. Starting out, it constantly yelled at me for unconnected nets and other issues -- things I didn't care about. When routing the PCB layout it would argue with all of the traces I made and there were constant red errors until I did seemingly arbitrary things until they turned green. I didn't understand what the tool was doing, and so I hated it.</p>
<p>Even after I stopped getting cryptic red errors and I was ready to export my PCB design and send it off to get fabricated, I had to wait 6 weeks for it to get to me! Once the PCB arrived the "fun" just continued. The damn thing didn't work. Except now I couldn't just plug in some extra wires and hook it up to an oscilloscope. I had to try to find an exposed surface connected to the thing I wanted to probe, and then I had to solder a thin wire to it. Sometimes, there is simply nothing exposed and you are shit out of luck. And once the error was found, it wasn't as simple as unplugging the misbehaving wire, you now had to use an exacto knife and cut the PCB trace and then solder tiny wires all over the place to fix everything.</p>
<p>My first experience with ECAD I just wanted to get back to a breadboard. It was faster to develop, easier to debug and just simpler to understand. Thankfully my mentors in life refused to allow me to sit in this local maximum, and I was pushed to use and learn the various ECAD tools. Curiously enough, I did not just learn to love ECAD -- I learned to <em>hate</em> breadboards. Where once breadboards gave me the power to wield electricity, they now hold me back and frustrate me endlessly.</p>
<h2 id="local-maximums-and-forcing-functions">Local Maximums and Forcing Functions<a href="#local-maximums-and-forcing-functions" aria-label="Anchor link for: local-maximums-and-forcing-functions">🔗</a>
</h2>
<p>How did this transition happen? How did I go from being empowered by breadboards to being held back by them? The observant reader will notice that many of the descriptions of a breadboard map to duck-typed, interpreted programming languages, like Python or Ruby. And, interestingly enough, I have an almost identical relationship with Python as I do breadboards! The reason is that both of these tools are local maximums. They provide endless flexibility, easy debugging and rapid iteration, but are perhaps less reliable or as fast as some of their alternatives. </p>
<p>But first, what does this have to do with technicians? In electrical engineering, the existence of technicians is a forcing function for learning proper ECAD tools. If you gave a technician a wired-up breadboard and said you needed 100 copies, they would likely tell you to fuck off. Software engineering has no such forcing function, and so we have a significant portion (perhaps the majority) of the industry in a local maximum using the equivalent of breadboards. The lack of a forcing function to use better tools has caused our industry to get stuck. </p>
<p>But why? I stopped using breadboards when I realized that the errors I used to make, and find easy to correct with a breadboard, I simply no longer made. And the errors that I now make, a breadboard has no way of preventing (and in general make so much harder to correct). For instance, accidentally connecting the wrong wire to the wrong chip or pin is not a thing I commonly do now. I always double check my schemas and my datasheets, and for new devices that I haven't worked with yet I build a breakout board to learn the constraints (and specifically, where the datasheet is wrong). Sure, I sometimes need to fix traces and solder some rewiring, but this is no longer due to silly accidents -- they are usually due to logic errors or an errata in the datasheet that I missed. In fact, the logic errors are largely avoided due to the schematic capture laying out the logic more accurately and easy to evaluate compared to a breadboard layout with its mess of wires.</p>
<p>However, the real reason I don't use breadboards anymore (or extremely rarely) is largely due to the lack of help they give with the things I now do. Taking an existing design and adding components or swapping out components is trivial in ECAD. I can just fix the schema, and then use push-shove routing to ensure that the component fits where I need it to. The ECAD tool ensures that my pre-existing traces are valid, and that constraints are being held (such as trace distancing). On a breadboard I have no such help. Swapping out a component on a breadboard is an absolutely miserable experience, since there is nothing checking whether you screwed up your other wiring as you did an invasive operation on the circuitry. Once I reached a level where I was no longer making beginner mistakes, I needed a tool that would help me with advanced mistakes, and I stopped caring about the beginner mistakes.</p>
<p>Now, notice how similar this is to programming languages. Languages with powerful, static type systems like Haskell make it trivial to rework a project. You just rip out what you used to have, put in the new code and then fix the type errors until it type-checks. This is unheard of in a language like Python or Ruby. And the tools that these dynamic languages provide become less and less useful in the first place. I no longer need the extreme inspectability of my running code -- I am confident that a for loop is going to act like a for loop, and that a Foo type is going to act like a Foo type. The additional flexibility that dynamic languages provide is now a downside -- I'd rather the logic be easily reviewed and checked rather than being able to plug in any type into any function.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">🔗</a>
</h2>
<p>The sad reality is that without technicians in software we have no forcing function to use proper engineering tools. This has had a profound effect on our industry -- and it would be identical to a large contingent of electrical engineers building shitty products with breadboards. Or mechanical engineers designing cars in TinkerCAD and 3D printing them.</p>
<p>Now, this is not saying that languages like Python or Ruby are bad, are going away anytime soon or can't produce great things. The Arduino community has shown just the number of amazing things that can be done with breadboards and an easy to use MCU. But you would be pissed if you paid a thousand dollars for a computer made with breadboards. Why do we tolerate the prevalence of people using ineffective tools in software engineering? Software engineering will not get better until we do our engineering with proper engineering tools. And that means strong, static typing.</p>
<p>Looking at other engineering disciplines it is clear that languages like Haskell, OCaml or Rust are the current proper engineering tools of software. They are hard to learn, provide a ton of tools to strictly specify your logic and provide constraints, and are …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I have used Clojure + Github Actions to automate two things so far: a script that periodically calls the Twitter API and does some analytics and one that does synchronization between two APIs. This combination does two things very well:</p><ol><li>You can run a job periodically, for free, without having your own server.</li><li>Interacting with APIs is simple and easy.</li></ol><p>Being dynamically-typed and data-oriented, Clojure is great for writing quick automation scripts. In particular, interacting with APIs is easy once you are comfortable working with maps, vectors and sequences. Additionally, Clojure’s built-in support for .edn makes it easy to store and read small amounts of data.</p><p>In this case, we want to run the job in a serverless manner, so where would we store the data? While it is possible to add a dependency on an external service to store small blobs of data, a far faster (and free) way is to leverage git and GitHub itself.</p><p>Normally, building this interface with git and GitHub would be tedious, but that’s where Github Actions <label for="1"></label>
<span id="1">I love it for hobby projects because I get 2000 free minutes of runtime a month, a growing collection of supported actions and secrets management.</span>
comes in.</p><p>After banging out a quick prototype of your script, the next thing you would want to do is to think about how you manage environment variables and secrets. This happens often when working with APIs since you often need to manage keys and secrets that should not be included as part of the source code. Fortunately for us, Clojure’s <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/environ">weavejester/enviorn</a> allows us to easily work with environment-dependent data. When doing local testing, secrets can be stowed in a gitignored <code>profiles.clj</code> file. When running in production, your Clojure binary can consume environment variables which are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">managed</a> by GitHub.</p><p>Another thing you might want to do is think about how to persist data. The easy way in Clojure is to write to the filesystem and let git + actions handle the rest. e.g.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>;; dump data</span>
(<span>spit</span> <span>"data.clj"</span> (pr-str [<span>:a</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:c</span>]))<span>`</span>

GPT-3 is a natural language model that, given some examples, tries to predict appropriate text output for a given text input. Since code is just text, there's the question of whether it can be used to produce code based only on a description of what the code should do. And, amazing world that we live in, there are already some early<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 49 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" data-reactid="50">tech demos</a><!-- react-text: 51 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 52 -->of exactly that.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="54">A common off-the-cuff reaction to such demos is that this sort of technology will inevitably make Software Engineers obsolete, because if an AI can produce more or less what they produce, then seemingly we won't need to pay them to do it anymore.</p><p data-reactid="55">The reasoning for these kinds of claims is understandable. If your premise is that a Software Engineer's job is to take a description of what some software should do, and write code to implement that, then it makes sense to view technology like this as a drop-in replacement.</p><p data-reactid="56">But that's not right. What a Software Engineer really does is build software solutions to solve problems appropriately. That seems like a subtle distinction, but it's a really important one. Code is not the solution, it's the implementation of a solution. The solution certainly requires that code be written, and hence the ability to write code. But from the other direction, given a problem the ability to write code does not imply the ability to create appropriate solutions.</p><p data-reactid="57">I think because writing code is intrinsically a difficult skill which is opaque and unfamiliar to outsiders, it appears like the hard part of building software is in fact writing code. But it really isn't, and that's the point. The hard part is solving the problem appropriately. Implementing that solution in code once you have it is comparatively easy.</p><p data-reactid="58">This is counter-intuitive, and I don't think it's something that can be fully appreciated without having gone through the process of building software yourself. Without this insight, it does indeed seem like an AI writing code opens up the possibility of generalists building software, just by describing their ideas. But that's no more the true than saying that hiring a skilled ghost writer opens up the possibility of anybody with an idea for a story writing a great novel.</p><p data-reactid="60">So, I understand the basis of these claims from an outsider's perspective. They are reasonable given the premises they're based on. What does surprise me a bit, though, is the common rebuttals that seem to come up from insiders - Software Engineers themselves.</p><p data-reactid="61">There are two main forms. The first is "this will never work": pointing out all the technical difficulties of such a thing in practice. The other is "it's all just code anyway": the notion that the natural language description of any software past a certain point of complexity would have to be structured and formalised to the extent that it basically becomes code.</p><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->I find these rebuttals surprising not because they're necessarily wrong. They're actually very practical - the thing has to basically work before the rest of the conversation is relevant, after all, and we're still a very long way from that being the case. I find them surprising more just because they meet the claims at their own level, thereby seeming to implicitly accept their premise. They say "this is wrong because AI won't be able to meaningfully write code" rather than "this is wrong because when AI <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="64">can</span><!-- react-text: 65 --> meaningfully write code, far from making Software Engineers obsolete, it will help them".<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="66">The reason I'd expect more Software Engineers to hold the latter view is because there's really nothing new here. I guess using AI to produce code looks like some giant leap at first glance, but it's really more a linear progression of something that's been happening in the software industry since day one - using software to automate writing software. Tools and frameworks that improve efficiency in building software by automating more and more of the heavy lifting are something that every Software Engineer is familiar with, and it's understood that they're unequivocally a good thing. Why should an AI generating code be any different?</p><p data-reactid="67">Furthermore, it's established at this point that such tools do not lead to less need for Software Engineers, because there is not a fixed limit of demand for software to be built. Rather, they allow more and better software to be built faster, opening new opportunities to apply software solutions where they weren't previously economical, growing the software industry and actually increasing the value of the skillset needed to build software, which again, is not the same thing as the ability to write code.</p><p data-reactid="69">Software Engineers should welcome every advancement that brings forward AI tools that assist in writing larger and more meaningful parts of our code. This isn't something to resist, but something to push forward, because far from making Software Engineers obsolete, these tools will further leverage the skills they have that are most valuable.</p><p data-reactid="70">And come on, who likes typing anyway?</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>We tend to think of software in terms of monolithic "apps." But what if we thought about software design as a process of curating existing parts into a holistic user experience?</p><div><p>So there’s a standard way that many note taking apps work these days. You choose an <em>app</em>, which includes a UI to read/write your notes, and cloud sync so you can work on your computer or your phone. Maybe you get decent offline support if you’re lucky. When it inevitably comes time to move on to the next app, you have to adapt to a whole new interface. And hopefully you can export your notes and port them over in some reasonable format.</p>

<p>There is an enlightened crowd of Emacs users who have done everything in plaintext for decades and rave about it on Hacker News. Parts of this philosophy are appealing to me: it would be nice to just use one editor for everything, and to have notes stored in an open portable format.</p>

<p>But I’ve never been able to really get into it. I don’t want to spend my whole day in an ugly terminal, and I definitely don’t want to spend hours fiddling with settings. I want a well designed product with a thoughtful out-of-the-box experience and a beautiful GUI. I currently use Notion, an elegant product with great design.</p>

<p>When openness and design are in tension, I choose design. I’m a Mac person, not a Linux on the Desktop person. But I wish I could have both.</p>

<h2 id="mostly-air">Mostly air</h2>

<p>That’s why I was excited to come across this tool called <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam">Foam</a>, a Markdown note taking tool inspired by the latest darling app of the note taking world, <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>.</p>

<p>It’s kind of hard to describe what Foam is. Foam definitely isn’t an app. It’s barely even…anything? Here’s how Foam’s creator describes it:</p>

<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Foam" data-author="" cite="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">
<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recommended Extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel</a>.</li></ol>



</blockquote>

<p>The install process is easy. You just create a git repo from a template, open it in VS Code, and then your VS Code essentially transforms into a new piece of software, with different visual design and all sorts of new features!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/images/article_images/foam-navigation-demo.gif?1595200989" alt="Foam navigation demo"></p>

<p>This all piggybacks on a couple key features of the VS Code text editor:</p>

<ul>
<li>a well-designed extension architecture and thriving ecosystem of extensions</li>
<li>the ability to specify a set of recommended extensions to install via a file</li>
<li>deeply customizing a ton of editor settings via a <code>settings.json</code> file</li>
</ul>

<p>While Foam does install its own extension, most of the value comes from installing <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions">other existing extensions</a> and choosing good default settings. For example, it installs a few extensions that provide a nicer Markdown writing experience, and that tweak lots of things about how Markdown docs link to each other. And it picks a color theme well suited to writing Markdown. I would have never come across this whole configuration on my own, but I’m glad that someone else figured it out for me.</p>

<p>The user experience still isn’t nearly as polished as a highly integrated tool like Notion. But it’s clear that someone at least thought about how all the pieces fit together into a cohesive whole. It feels closer to a product than a random bag of parts.</p>

<p>I think this is a neat way of creating value in software. <strong>The essential value of Foam isn’t code—it’s the opinionated curation of existing building blocks.</strong></p>

<h2 id="software-as-curation">Software as curation</h2>

<p>I’ve previously pointed out that with a powerful enough extension system, end users can kind of start building their own software:</p>

<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Browser%20extensions%20are%20underrated%3A%20the%20promise%20of%20hackable%20software" data-author="Geoffrey Litt" cite="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html">
By installing four different Gmail extensions that modify everything from the visual design to the core functionality, in some sense, I’ve put together my own email client. <strong>Instead of being a passive user of pre-built applications, I can start assembling my own personalized way of using my computer.</strong>

</blockquote>

<p>The trouble is, this is a lot of work, and the type of thing that many users (including myself!) try to avoid. Saving people the initial effort and giving them a starting point can be really helpful.</p>

<p>Maybe one view on this is that most software is like a restaurant: you pay for the final end product. <strong>But Foam is more like a recipe than a final dish.</strong> A recipe tells you a good combination of ingredients, and you get to make the food yourself, substituting ingredients to your liking along the way. We all realize recipes are valuable. It’s easier to cook from a recipe than to make up a dish from scratch, even if you end up making tweaks.</p>

<p>Also, there’s a role in the world for both restaurants and home cooking! I’m not saying that all restaurants are bad or that all software needs to be built like this. Just that it’s nice to have some software where the end user plays a larger role in the final assembly:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>2/ Yes, the restaurant food is truly “better” in many ways, and there’s a role for restaurants in society…</p><p>But I wouldn’t want to live in a world where no one cooks, and food is something we can only choose off a menu.</p><p>Software is increasingly heading to that place.</p></div>— Geoffrey Litt (@geoffreylitt) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1177607450863767553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2019</a></blockquote> 

<p>By the way, one funny thing is that a lot of software is actually built like this under the hood. Engineers don’t make things from scratch these days, they find libraries and assemble them into products where the seams are hidden from the user. In the Foam model, the modules are exposed—giving me the power to open the hood and disable or replace individual parts.</p>



<p>I don’t know yet if I’m going to actually move my note taking into Foam, but I’m giving it a shot. It has a lot going for it:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Generic editor</strong>: I get to use VSCode, which is my main text editor for coding. I can reap investment from learning that generic tool, rather than needing to use yet another text editing UI. The consistency matters for muscle memory.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable</strong>: Even though the tool comes with curated extensions and settings, I can still change things. I changed the default typeface, and I removed the graph viewing extension because I didn’t feel the need for it. So many note taking apps would be better if you could remove features… (looking at you, Evernote!)</li>
<li><strong>Local data storage</strong>: It’s so nice to be confident in offline mode. Every cloud notes app I’ve used has lost data at some point when I came back online.</li>
<li><strong>Open format</strong>: Foam seems to try very hard to store everything in vanilla Markdown with minimal extensions, which feels like a solid foundation for a long term notes collection. I’m confident I could move to another tool and actually preserve the structure of my notes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="challenges-and-questions">Challenges and questions…</h2>

<p><strong>Lowest common denominator formats</strong>: The fundamental bargain of open formats is that you gain interop and portability, and you lose the ability to innovate. This is why note taking tools often offer limited <em>one-time export</em> into other formats, but usually have their own proprietary format as a source of truth. Is there any way around this dilemma?</p>

<p>This summer I’m working with Ink and Switch on <a href="https://inkandswitch.github.io/cambria/">a project about decentralized schema evolution</a> that hopes to make some headway on allowing tools to collaborate with each other, even if they use different data formats.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-device / collaborative editing</strong>: One of the main barriers to a “tools, not apps” approach right now is that files are a bad abstraction for editing across multiple devices, especially collaborative realtime editing. It makes sense that services like Notion build their own collaborative text editing tech and clearly can’t rely on the filesystem. If we had <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">better infrastructure for local-first software</a>, perhaps it could help usher in a new world of open tools, built on a more modern abstraction than files?</p>

<p><strong>Beyond text editing?</strong>: Text editing seems like the ideal use case for this whole philosophy of generic open tools. Text is one of the more portable formats out there. Text files are small and can easily be stored on your computer. What are other domains where we could use more generic tools?</p>

<p><strong>Business model:</strong> Foam is a free product. If I was willing to pay for Foam, I’d want to pay the creators of the open source extensions behind it, not just the person who combined them into a product. And yet, I think the curation step is creating a lot of the value here too, and don’t want to undervalue it.</p>

<p>This seems like the deepest problem to solve in this area. It’s hard to sell a product that’s “mostly air.” If we want more software like this, we probably need to figure out how people can be compensated for their curation work.</p>

It works since we are not perfect in managing states and our codes may stick at some states because of unhandled states or some bugs.</u></p><h2 id="cloud-native-world">Cloud Native World</h2><p>After decades, there is a consensus in the software industry: Need for restart is inevitable so let’s make it less painful.</p><p>From the application point of view, these two attributes are pretty crucial</p><ul><li>Being stateless or having states as minimum as possible (see <a href="https://12factor.net/disposability">Processes</a> )</li><li>Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown (see <a href="https://12factor.net/disposability">Disposability</a> )</li></ul><p>From orchestrator point of view, 2 features are must:</p><ul><li>Allow workloads to state their health statuses</li><li>Restart failed/unhealthy workloads.</li></ul><p>All problems seem solved. Right? Run multiple instances, restart unhealthy ones, achieve high availability. PERFECT!</p><p>Additionally, there are always some levels in software architectures and it is better to restart things in higher levels (implies smaller scope) -if possible- to reduce the overhead. Like restarting frozen Chrome instead of restarting PC.</p><h2 id="a-short-summary-of-pods-in-kubernetes">A short summary of pods in Kubernetes</h2><p>The main subject of this write-up is pods in Kubernetes. Let’s take a closer look at pods. Here are three quotes from <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/">the official doc</a>:</p><ul><li><p>“Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.”</p></li><li><p>“A Pod is a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.”</p></li><li><p>“The shared context of a Pod is a set of Linux namespaces, cgroups, and potentially other facets of isolation…”</p></li></ul><p>Shortly, Pod = Shared Context + Containers.
<img src="https://erkanerol.github.io/img/pods_simplified.png" title="pods-simplified"></p><p>Since pods are the smallest and fundamental workloads in Kubernetes, <u>to be able to restart pods is extremely crucial/necessary to reach the level at which we want to be by accepting to spend tremendous effort unrelated to our core application.</u> ( <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=is+kubernetes+too+complicated">See Kubernetes criticisms</a> )</p><h2 id="restart-mechanisms-for-pods">Restart Mechanisms for Pods</h2><p>Quote <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy">the official doc</a>,</p><blockquote><p>A PodSpec has a <code>restartPolicy</code> field with possible values Always, OnFailure, and Never. The default value is Always. <code>restartPolicy</code> applies to all Containers in the Pod.</p></blockquote><p>It seems Kubernetes is able to restart failed containers on behalf of us when they fail. Fine! What about unhealthy ones? We have <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command">livenessProbe</a></p><blockquote><p>livenessProbe: Indicates whether the Container is running. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the Container, and the Container is subjected to its restart policy.</p></blockquote><p><u>Shortly, the containers in pods are restartable</u>. The temporary states inside containers are not a problem in Kubernetes world. Also, it doesn’t refresh the shared context so the overhead is so minimal. Everything seems perfect at container level until now.</p><p><u>What about the shared context under the containers? Do we have a mechanism to refresh it in pod level. Unfortunately, NO.</u></p><p>What? What happens when the shared context enters an invalid state somehow? Who is going to take care of it?</p><h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2><p>Quote <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">the official doc</a></p><ul><li>“In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed.”</li></ul><p><img src="https://erkanerol.github.io/img/pods_simplified_with_controller.png" title="pods_simplified_with_controller"></p><p><strong><em>My comments&amp;expectations:</em></strong> Wow!!! It seems Kubernetes is designed in such a way that every agent has one job and does it well. There may be some problematic/missing pods in the cluster but we aim to solve this problem by using some controllers. Refreshing the whole pod may not be in the scope of pod controller, but it must be handled by other controllers in higher levels (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering">Fundamental theorem of software engineering</a>).</p><p><strong><em>Reality:</em></strong> There are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/">a bunch of built-in controllers</a> in Kubernetes. StatefulSets for stateful applications, DaemonSets for running an application in every node, ReplicaSets for running multiple instances with same pod spec, Deployments for declarative updates etc. <u>However, none of them has functionality to fix a pod in <code>CrashLoopBackOff</code> state. For them, the state of a pod is “given.”. The only thing they do is to adapt their behavior according to this fact such as stopping rolling upgrades. BUT THEY DON’T TOUCH THE UNHEALTHY PODS.</u></p><p>Don’t you believe me? Here is an example: <a href="https://gist.github.com/erkanerol/528eab81c0db1cdcc3b9a13560d58047">https://gist.github.com/erkanerol/528eab81c0db1cdcc3b9a13560d58047</a> After one minute, you are going to observe 3 pods in <code>CrashLoopBackOff</code> state which will stick at this state forever if you don’t delete them manually.</p><p>The error in the example above may seem silly to you but there are a lot of real cases in which people hit similar issues because of different errors in different components: A problem in storage plugin, an anomaly in CNI plugin, an invalid state in shared volumes, etc.</p><p>At the end of the day, there is a state in the shared context of the pod and it is inevitable to do some mistakes that disrupt it. Why don’t we have a mechanism to clean it in pod level? Why do we assume that the state won’t be broken? Why do we compromise self-healing and expect manual intervention at such a core level?</p><p>Here are my ideas:</p><ul><li><p>Pods can have a restart policy for the whole pod including the shared context. There can be maxRestartCount field like <code>backoffLimit</code> in Jobs to stop restarting repeatedly. I think it is better to restart only failed containers at first and then restart the whole pod if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Now, we mostly run pods via some high-level workloads (e.g. deployments) and what we do is to delete the pod and to allow the high-level controller to recreate them. However, “naked pods” are also in the game. Recreation can be a solution in higher levels, but it should not be the solution in pod level. Pods can be fully restartable and it can be possible to trigger a restart via the API and a kubectl command.</p></li><li><p>Built-in controllers can watch the state and intervene in the errors with some primitive, retry logic. For example, the deployment controller can delete a pod in <code>CrashLoopBackOff</code> state and recreate it from scratch. Sometimes, to schedule a problematic pod into another node solves a temporary problem in storage plugin and this feature can solve many cases like this.</p></li></ul><h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2><p>Kubernetes community is one of the best tech communities. I know the core team is very open for feedbacks and the community likes talking about possible improvements a lot. I just shared my personal opinions. I hope it will be beneficial to readers and increase awareness about this problem.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <p><img src="https://consulting.0x4447.com/assets/img/articles/cloudformation-tips-and-tricks/header.jpg" width="100%" alt="CloudFormation Tips and Tricks"></p><p>This article is meant for CEOs, CTOs, and Managers. The goal is to give a better understanding of what CloudFormation is and why it should be used for every AWS project, by answering a common question clients have: <em>What are the the most important things our team should be aware of when working on a CF file?</em></p>



<p>Since a CloudFormation is nothing more then a JSON file, one might think that keeping everything in one big file is the right way to go. But it is not. After you have added multiple services, even as little as 3, then you will have to scroll across the file like crazy trying to edit it, and each new service exponentially extends the complexity of managing the file.</p>

<p>A good approach that I found helpful is to keep the JSON familiarity while braking down each service in a separated JSON file. Hence, I create a framework called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x4447/grapes">Grapes</a>.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x4447/grapes">Grapes framework</a>, you are free to structure the Resource folder however you want. You can nest folders and name your files in total freedom – whatever makes sense to your project.</p>

<p>The only imposed structure is the root folders. I have used Grapes since 2019 and I have been able to make and easily manage a massive stack, since everything remains neatly organized. Below you can find a handful of links to open source projects that I released using Grapes.</p>



<p>One of the few negatives about CloudFormation is the parameters part and how it is implemented in the AWS Console.</p>

<p>When you deploy a stack the first time with multiple parameters and there is an error, you’ll loose everything you added. This is infuriating when you have a stack with 50 parameters, because if you have to redeploy a stack until it works, and let’s say it takes 10 retries and you have 50 parameters, then that’s equal to you having to do 500 copy and paste actions.</p>

<p>The only work around at this moment is to start small. Make the smallest stack that makes sense to you, deploy it successfully, and then the parameters will be saved. Afterwards you can incrementally add a service to the others.</p>

<p>This approach is also good to more quickly find issues within the CF file.</p>



<p>Since we are on the parameters topic, I highly recommend making sure all your parameters have simple, clear names that explain what to expect from them. You can add as many details of the description as you would like, even if the description is just a copy and paste of the input field. The purpose of this is to have a clear description with your default parameters in the description itself, which gives you a reference to the parameters. If you don’t have a good description, then when you come back months after you made the stack and have to deploy it in another account, then you won’t remember what parameters are needed for the stack.</p>



<p>Each resource described in the CloudFormation file must have a unique name as the JSON object Key. I recommend that you name them carefully, ideally with a simple pattern, because once the stack is deploy it can cause a lot of drama to change the name of the resource. For example:</p>

<p>CloudFormation deploys changes by first making the new resource, and if all goes well, it deletes the old one. Such as, if you have a S3 bucket that you want to rename (renaming the bucket not the service object Key), then AWS will make the new bucket first, and when all is successful, it will delete the old one if empty.</p>

<p>But if you were to rename the object Key, then AWS will see the changes as: “I have to add a completely new service, while deleting the old one.” But since AWS first makes resources and then deletes them, in this case you would get an error because AWS would try to make a S3 Bucket that already exists. Thus resulting in a update error.</p>

<p>Instead, the solution is to rename the resource while also renaming the S3 Bucket by adding at the end of the name, for example, <code>1</code>. Deploying that will be sufficient, since now the buckets have unique names. Then remove the <code>1</code> from the name and update the stack again.</p>

<p>This trick won’t work in some AWS resources and you might be stuck.</p>

<p>Make sure your resource names are standardized, and always follow this standard, because once they are used it is going to be almost impossible to rename them.</p>

<p>CloudFormation is for people that like to be organized and keep everything neat. With this service, you can’t just do something quick and later improve upon it; you have to have it right from the start - otherwise it is going to be complete misery later working with it.</p>



<p>CloudFormation allows you to create a cross-stack reference that can be used in another stack. For example, one stack creates a S3 Bucket, and then you can reference the name of the Bucket in the 2nd stack.</p>

<p>At first this sounds like a cool and useful idea, but in practice it is the most dangerous feature out there for CF.</p>

<p>The problem is similar to the previous section. Because once a stack is referenced by other stack, the referenced one can’t be modified because other stacks rely on it. Meaning if you have a daisy chain of 3 stacks and you wanted to edit the first one, you’d have to sequentially delete the whole stack before it, from right to left.</p>

<p>This feature is one that you should never use. The ideal approach when you want to reference a resource created in one stack with another, is to just output the resource name or ID in the original stack, copy it, and paste it in the params section of the second one. This way you still can split your stack and keep everything small and compact, while staying flexible and free to make any changes. Of course you have to remember that if you rename a S3 Bucket in the original stack, you then have to update all the CF files that uses the Bucket name.</p>



<p>If you have your work organized with 2 AWS accounts, one for production and one for development, then it doesn’t necessarily mean that the CloudFormation file you created and tested in development will work in production.</p>

<p>When working on the CF file you add features as you go, slowly building it out. And by doing so, you build on top of pre-existing services that already exist from the previous deployment.</p>

<p>Deploying the stack from scratch in production will create all the services at once, and in some cases a service that relies on another one won’t deploy because not everything is in place, which means that the stack will fail.</p>

<p>To mitigate this problem, I recommend that you delete the stack in development and then redeploy it from scratch. This approach will let you see what will fail, and then you will know how to set the <code>DependsOn</code> option to make sure the stack is deployed in the right order.</p>

<p>Only then can you be confident that deploying the stack in production will work.</p>



<p>Move slowly, iterate piece by piece, and be organized - these are things to keep in mind when working with CloudFormation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Tirana – ambushed and two diplomatsÂ&nbsp;shot is Part 1 of a story that occurred in 1998, a volatile year in that country’s recent history. At this time, British diplomats who were posted to a volatile or conflict region received virtually no Hostile Environment Training (HET). It was usually the case you popped into King Charles Street for a quick chat with the relevant desk officer who would brief you, then it was off to Heathrow.</p>
<p>There was still no HET in place before my next posting to Kosovo, but thankfully, the FCO had got it’s act together by 2005. Then, just prior to my posting to Iraq, I received a one week HET training course carried out by a private contract firm just outside Hereford.</p>
<p>It was comprehensive and tailored to the area where I would be serving. Who knows, if we had had this training in 1998 the event that took place below may have turned out differently.</p>
<h2>Scene Setter:</h2>
<p>After 4 months, having more or less settled into my tour in <strong>Tirana</strong> the capital city of Albania, Easter arrived with an extra couple of days off for the official holiday tagged onto the weekend. The Ambassador was out of the country on vacation, so the Deputy Head of Mission (DHM), the Management Officer (MO) and myself decided that we would pay a visit to a popular restaurant situated at the top of the Dajte mountain just outside Tirana.</p>
<p>On checking with the local police, It was deemed that the area and the route was safe to travel in and we had it on good authority from other diplomats who had been there recently that the food at the restaurant was excellent and that there had been no security issues during their visits. So, doubly reassured, we decided that we would head up there on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>The day arrived and we piled into the DHMâ€™s battered old Peugeot (which had diplomatic plates), which she had bought locally for our trip up the mountain. It was a wonderfully clear and sunny day and we were looking forward to getting out of Tirana for a few hours for some good food plus the view from the restaurant terrace at the top of the mountain was reputed to be spectacular.</p>
<p>The journey out of Tirana up the winding road of the Dajte mountain passed uneventfully. It was wonderful to get out of the city and drive through the small villages, past the innumerable pillboxes (some of which the villagers had creatively converted into animal shelters for their cows, pigs and chickens) and up into the clear and clean air of the mountain</p>
<p>Eventually we reached our destination and noticed that the car park was empty apart from the Saudi Arabian Ambassadorâ€™s official car parked outside as well as a couple of expensive looking Mercedes, which apparently belonged to his bodyguards.</p>
<p>Given the lack of customers, we should not have to wait too long for table service. The MO and the DHM went inside the restaurant while I walked onto the terrace to admire the view. It was stunning. You could see for miles and even Tirana in the distance looked beckoning.</p>
<p>After soaking in the views and inhaling the clean fresh air, I returned to the restaurant to rejoin my colleagues inside, paying my respects to the Saudi Arabian Ambassadorâ€™s party as I passed their table. The MO had already ordered the drinks so we set about tackling the menu.</p>
<p>We all had a rabbit dish in a sort of stew with dumplings for which the restaurant was well known. Rabbit is not my favourite dish, but I had to admit that with all the additional mysterious spices they had added to the stew, it was delicious.</p>
<p>We also spent the meal discussing cars prompted by the envy of having seen the Saudi Ambassadorâ€™s sleek fleet outside the restaurant. All our embassy official vehicles being armoured (except the DHMâ€™s privately owned Peugeot) meant that half of them were off the road at any one time awaiting spares to be flown in as they all suffered continuous suspension and tyre problems driving around the badly kept potholed roads of Tirana and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>They were just too heavy for the task.</p>
<p>The MO jokingly said we should go visit Durres. At that time the port of Durres on the coast was the site of the weekly ferry from Italy that regularly brought in a whole shipment of top of the range vehicles from â€œvarious sourcesâ€� throughout Europe. These were then all deposited in a field outside the port and once a week there was a sale of these vehicles, all transactions in cash and in US dollars.</p>
<p>The MO said he could have picked up a virtually new top of the range Porsche 911 for just under $5000 however, the only problem was that he could never take it out of the country.</p>
<h2>The Ambush:</h2>
<p>After finishing our meal and paying, we left saying goodbye to the Saudi Arabian Ambassador and his party and jumped back into the Peugeot for the return trip to Tirana. I sat in the front seat next to the DHM and the MO got into the back. We then set off down the mountain hoping to get back to Tirana before it got too dark.</p>
<p>After about 5 minutes driving slowly down the narrow, winding route, we had just taken a short bend when right in front of us in the middle of the narrow road appeared a caped and masked gunman pointing an AK47 directly at us and beckoning us to stop.</p>
<p>The shocking impact of this sight lasted a couple of seconds. Both the MO and I being ex-military knew that in situations such as this, stopping was the last thing you contemplate. What you do is put your foot on the accelerator and drive through fast and hope for the best. If a bad guy is in front of you, you drive through him as well.</p>
<p>We both yelled at the DHM to hit the accelerator and get us out of there. What did she do? She slowed down and stopped the car with the engine turning over. Now we were in trouble. Although there was only one gunman in front of us, we did not know if there were others hidden in the bushes and rocks on the slopes at the side of the road.</p>
<p>The gunman, still standing menacingly in front of us kept on nervously cocking his AK47 all the time. Why was he doing this? I had no idea. You only need to cock the weapon once for it to be primed and ready to fire.</p>
<p>He was either very inexperienced in weapon handling or extremely nervous himself. Now they say that victims of gun crime are usually so fixated on the weapon that they cannot remember anything else.</p>
<p>What I do remember is that his AK47 looked as if it had seen better days, perhaps it was one of the weapons looted from military arsenals the previous year during the nationwide civil unrest. It looked dirty and rusty and when he was continually cocking it, it looked as if he was having trouble working the moving parts properly.</p>
<p>Using hand signals, he then indicated that he wanted money and valuables. He also pointed to his watch and again motioned to us. I got out my wallet, which contained the equivalent of about thirty US dollars in local currency and held it up to the windscreen.</p>
<p>I wound down the window and he came around the side of the vehicle and took it off me as well as my watch (how I wished then that I was wearing one of the cheap, fake Rolex watches from the bazaar). With this, I then thought he would go round to the other side of the vehicle and relieve my two colleagues of their valuables as well.</p>
<p>He did nothing of the kind. He went back and stood in front of the vehicle and motioned for us to all get out of the car. I turned to my right and glanced at the DHM who was staring fixated on the road ahead.</p>
<p>We were not going to get much direction or leadership from that direction. I glanced over my shoulder and quickly spoke with the MO. We both rapidly agreed that there was no way we were getting out of the car. God knows what would happen to us if we did. We both decided we needed to hit the gas and get out of there pretty damn quick.</p>
<p>I turned to the DHM and told her what the MO and I wanted her to do. Thankfully she seemed to quickly come back to reality and realised that what we proposed was the only way to go.</p>
<p>The gunman was by now growing more and more agitated as he started to come round to the driver’s side of the car and his obsession with cocking his weapon seemed to increase in intensity</p>
<p>I also thought I spotted another two armed men behind a large boulder slightly further up the mountainside. It was now or never. I told her to put the car into first, which she did. I then said I would count to three and on three for her to hit the accelerator as hard as she could.</p>
<h2>Escape:</h2>
<p>One..Two..Three, she banged the accelerator hard and the car lunged down the road. As she did so, I fell forward and my head bounced off the dashboard and instinctively I decided to keep my head well down touching my knees.</p>
<p>The gunman sensing that something was going to happen, jumped to one side at the last moment, which fortunately for me was the driverâ€™s side and at the same time he let loose.</p>
<p>Amongst the fusillade of bullets, miraculously only one lucky shot penetrated the inside of the car, but what damage it caused.</p>
<p>It passed through the wing mirror of the car, then through the door window, through the DHMâ€™s arm, through her headrest and finally hit the MO in the stomach. One bullet, so much damage, goodness knows what else the gunman had hit.</p>
<p>The car had by now travelled a fair distance, the DHM still had her foot hard down on the accelerator as we sped down the hill. We passed through the villages we had transited on the way up without stopping, for all we knew the gunmen were local and had relatives or other accomplices in these villages.</p>
<p>After what seemed an eternity, but in reality was only a few minutes or so, we reached the bottom of the mountain. We pulled into a large guesthouse come restaurant that we had visited a month before and where we were on nodding terms with the owner and came to a stop.</p>
<p>There was silence. Nobody spoke. I looked at the DHM. She was extremely pale and holding her bloodied arm, she had done a bloody good job driving that car especially now that I realised she had been wounded.</p>
<p>In the back, the MO was conscious lying …</p></article></div>

<p>Thankfully, the FT provides a sourcemap so I was able to find the de-minified <code>legal-copy/main.js</code> implementation and see what was going on. Essentially, it boils down to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>handleCopy</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>selection</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>getSelection</span><span>().</span><span>toString</span><span>();</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>wordCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>selection</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>\s</span><span>+/</span><span>).</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>wordCount</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>patchedText</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>+</span> <span>selection</span><span>;</span>
        <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>clipboardData</span><span>.</span><span>setData</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>text/plain</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>patchedText</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>copy</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>handleCopy</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It includes some subtleties around detecting browser support for the rich <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ClipboardEvent/clipboardData">ClipboardEvent API</a> and handling legacy Chrome quirks, as well as trying to disable the “feature” when it suspects a screen reader is being used (points to the FT for accessibility consideration, though I have a feeling this was a response to a complaint).</p>

<p>Is copying 30 words legal? The injected text warns “Copying articles to share with others is a breach of FT.com T&amp;Cs and Copyright Policy”—copying <em>articles</em>, not 30 words. I’m no lawyer, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a> protects a great many things one might copy 30 words for, like quotation in another article, or in my case, personal notekeeping. While some infringing uses can be imagined, does this warrant such a violation of internet norms?</p>

<p>The current working draft of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/">W3C Clipboard spec</a> describes mechanical use-cases for manipulating the clipboard like attaching metadata, rich text transfer, and translating mathematical notation to plaintext—not scaring people away from exercising their rights. There’s a set of implicit ground rules for what should and should not be done on websites. Interfering with standard access patterns like closing tabs and using right-click menus violates the social contract of the internet and further threatens its endangered state as a thing to be used, not a thing that uses you.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the article I was reading was by <a href="http://james-boyle.com/">James Boyle</a>, a copyright reformist who was a columnist for the Financial Times largely because they allowed him to <a href="https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/bipolar.html">retain his copyrights</a>, with at least some under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">Creative Commons licenses</a>, so it seems likely I actually <em>could</em> copy the whole article if I wanted to.</p>

<p>It turns out lots of other people have noticed this kind of bad behavior and have built circumventing browser extensions like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/absolute-enable-right-click">this one</a> which I just happily used to copy this passage from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b46f5a58-aa2e-11db-83b0-0000779e2340">the article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The internet makes copying cheap. Businesses that see their livelihood as dependent on the restriction of copying – concentrated in the recording, film, publishing and software industries – are understandably upset. Their goal is to have the same ability to control their content as they had in an analog world but to keep all the benefits of pervasiveness, cost saving, and viral marketing that a global digital network brings. To that end, they have moved aggressively to change laws worldwide, to introduce stiffer penalties, expand rights, mandate technological locks, forbid reverse engineering, and increase enforcement. It is not so much a case of wanting to have their cake and eat it, as to have their cake and make your cake illegal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>T</span>he way we live is out of balance with the way we eat. About eleven percent of the Earthâ€™s land area is used for agriculture; meanwhile, two-thirds of the human population is now jammed in cities, which cover a mere three percent. Continued urbanization and population growth will require more farmland, more transportation, and an even bigger ecological footprint—unless we can find more efficient ways to feed the world.</p>
<p>One intriguing solution is to give traditional agriculture a 90 degree twist into <em>vertical farming</em>, where crops are grown indoors in tightly stacked rows, sustained hydroponically so that they donâ€™t need dirt. A lot of food production could then be relocated to urban regions, so that less wilderness would need to be converted to cropland, notes <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/postdoctoral-research/postdocs/choon-tak-kwon/" target="_blank">Choon-Tak Kwon</a>, a postdoctoral fellow in plant biology at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The financial and ecological cost of transporting food should decrease substantially, too. â€œYou can grow perishable crops near your home all the year around,â€� Kwon says, ideally leading to â€œfresher foods with stable prices.â€�
</p>
<p>We know that the basic concept works. Vertical farming and related forms of urban agriculture already account for a little over fifteen percent of the worldâ€™s agricultural production, according to the U.N.&nbsp;Food and Agriculture Organization. But that yield is dominated by a few crops—mostly leafy greens—that grow well inside, limiting the potential for further expansion.
</p>
<p>For urban agriculture to have a meaningful impact on preserving wild habitats, â€œthe diversity of crops that can be grown indoors must increase,â€� <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0400-z" target="_blank">argues</a> Cathryn Oâ€™Sullivan, an agricultural scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia. Trouble is, most major crops are too big and gangly to grow well in the confined spaces of vertical farms. Ramping up urban food production will therefore require changing not just <em>how</em> farmers grow crops, but also <em>what</em> they grow.
</p>
<p>Kwon decided to accept the challenge, taking tomato plants as his test case. In conjunction with his advisor, Cold Spring Harbor plant geneticist Zachary Lippman, and other members of Lippmanâ€™s lab, he set out to determine whether it is possible to radically shrink tomatoesâ€™ stems without compromising their fruit yield. Now he has his answer: Why yes, it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>D</span>uring a series of lab experiments, Kwon and his colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0361-2" target="_blank">discovered a set of mutations</a> that lead to shorter tomato plants that produced fruit more quickly. These plants, he realized, would be well suited to vertical farms. Then the researchers used a gene-editing molecular tool called CRISPR-Cas9 to insert the mutations into a commonly grown crop, the Sweet 100 cherry tomato. The result was an absurdly dense-looking plant, roughly a quarter-meter tall but jammed with grape-like bunches of cherry tomatoes. Even better, the first cherries were ready for harvest just a little over a month after seedlings sprouted, about two weeks faster than the regular variety.
</p>
<p>Kwon normally stashes away the fruits of his experiments, saving the seeds to grow new plants, but when he saw the first big cluster of tomatoes from his triple-edited plant, â€œI just tried it,â€� he says. He liked them so much that he started bringing home extras for his wife to use in salads. That bounty has since expanded; he and his team have found that inserting the same genes into other tomato varieties results in similarly compact, rapidly-bountiful plants. Next, he wants to see if this gene set works on additional crops in the same family, such as eggplants and peppers.
</p>
<blockquote>Urban agriculture could lead to reduced use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides.</blockquote>
<p>Other researchers are finding ways to apply targeted genetic shrinking to completely unrelated crops, as well. In 2018, Erika Varkonyi-Gasic and her colleagues with the New Zealand Institute for Plant &amp; Food Research Limited in Auckland <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.13021" target="_blank">created a dwarf kiwi vine</a> through gene editing. Instead of long, climbing vines that take a few years to mature, the engineered kiwis were just a meter long at maturity and produced fruit within a year. The global appetite for kiwi fruit may be modest, but the shrinking technique could soon be ubiquitous.
</p>
<p>Improved lighting could further expand the yield of vertical farms. â€œNatural sunlight is much stronger and much better than todayâ€™s LEDs,â€� Kwon notes, so urban farmers will need to develop better lighting technology—or else design more light-efficient plants. He is starting to consider the kinds of genetic tinkering that might be required to do that.
</p>
<p>The potential payoffs go well beyond preserving and restoring wilderness. Urban agriculture could lead to reduced use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. It could also make the food supply more robust and secure. â€œCities could have fresh crops from vertical farms even if arable lands suffer major disasters,â€� Kwon notes. â€œVertical farms are almost pathogen- and disease-free.â€�
</p>
<p>He is even looking ahead to life in harsh environments beyond Earth. â€œThe development of vertical farming is very connected to space agriculture,â€� Kwon says. By investing in urban agriculture here, then, we could be inching closer to a future of space adventurers happily dining on fresh tomato soup and garden-grown salad on Mars.

<p>Starting your career as a software engineer can be challenging, especially if it’s your first job. I was there eight years ago, starting at my first tech job after moving to a new city, speaking a new language. Books, experiences, and people taught me how to navigate the early part of my career, so I thought I’d highlight a few of those lessons I learned with this post. I hope that applying some of these will make you stand out and accelerate your early career as a developer.</p>
<h3>Always be learning</h3>
<p>You don’t stop learning after you leave college or your Bootcamp; learning is considered a lifelong journey in this field. Read books and articles, take courses, and participate in workshops and hackathons. Bonus Tip: Sometimes, companies pay for you to do all this, ask your manager if this is something you can expense.</p>
<h3>Don’t assume existing code is untouchable</h3>
<p>Well-intentioned code can have anti-patterns in it, be hard to read, get stale over time, and it can create bugs. So go ahead and suggest a change to the code, it may need it.</p>
<h3>Healthy Habits = Good Code</h3>
<p>Keeping healthy habits may sound obvious, but we don’t often apply it. We need to move, sleep, and eat well to have the energy we need to be great. For example, it took me a long time to realize that delicious but heavy lunch meals would make me feel tired every afternoon, which affected my performance and meant I had to work longer hours to compensate for it. Everyone’s different, but learn what your body needs and treat it well.</p>
<h3>If in doubt, underpromise and overdeliver</h3>
<p>This is especially true early on, but it continues to be right for me eight years later. If your goal is to match and exceed expectations consistently, it is best to consistently deliver on your goals and surprise people with your speed than to promise the moon but always be late.</p>
<h3>Embrace the grunt work</h3>
<p>See a problem? Volunteer to help fix it. See an area of improvement? Say yes to working on it. Being proactive has multiple benefits. As a result of it, the product improves, the productivity and morale of those around you go up, you learn a new skill, and you gain the respect of others. You can then use this goodwill and track record to work on more exciting things over time.</p>
<h3>Code is social</h3>
<p>It’s pretty standard for engineers to review each other’s code at software companies. Don’t think this is only something that only experienced engineers do, though. Review your teammates’ code and learn from it. Don’t just read it, but also comment on it and ask questions. Learn from how people write code.</p>
<h3>Feedback = Improvement</h3>
<p>Explicitly ask for feedback from your manager and teammates. Use this feedback to transform yourself continuously. Remember that one of the best ways to learn is by doing the wrong thing, realizing why it’s wrong, and then not doing it anymore. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<h3>Take ownership of something</h3>
<p>Work with your manager to find something that can be yours. Working on a project of your own gives you a way to be unique, learn about all the stages of development, and cultivate accountability.</p>
<h3>Look for the low-hanging fruits</h3>
<p>There are many small things in the codebase that you can do with your current skillset. Taking these on and showing off your skills right away is an excellent way to get noticed.</p>
<h3>Don’t forget that experienced engineers have screwed up before</h3>
<p>We made the same mistakes you’re making, probably even more of them. We just learned from them already, so we look better to you now x years later.</p>
<h3>Be everywhere</h3>
<p>Show up every day to discuss problems, answer your teammates’ questions, celebrate wins, and provide the very least moral support when things go wrong. You want others to think that you’ve been at the company for much longer.</p>
<h3>Speak up</h3>
<p>It’s a good idea to be humble in general, but you also want to communicate your thoughts, even if you lack experience. People like to see new people with different perspectives add to the conversation.</p>
<h3>Build relationships</h3>
<p>Talk to your teammates, not just the engineers. It may not seem obvious now, but your job satisfaction will likely have a lot to do how comfortable you feel with the people around you. You’ll spend time with them 40 hours a week, which is close to half of your waking life.</p>
<h3>Rely on&nbsp;your manager</h3>
<p>Ask your manager to help you plan out your goals and to keep you accountable. They’re there for you, use their time and support wisely.</p>
<h3>Have fun</h3>
<p>You want to enjoy doing this because you’ll likely be doing it for many years. Find projects that connect with you, work on problems that excite you.</p>
<h3>Find mentors</h3>
<p>Have lunch, coffee with more experienced engineers, develop a rapport with them and ask them every question you have, most of them won’t mind it, and some of them will even love to talk to you (I find myself in this camp).</p>
<p>It’s a long journey, but I hope this can serve you in your first several years. Above all else, stay true to yourself.</p></div></div>]]>

At least this was not the outcome Frau Merkel had wished?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>My first thought was that it spelled the end of any possibility of harmonizing corporate tax rates across the Eurozone, an issue that I am on Mrs Merkel’s side. The second thought was that the Irish finance minister’s victory was a victory for forces pushing for greater, not less, austerity across the European Union. It was not a good moment for Europe. [From the above you can see that I never automatically opposed whatever Mrs Merkel favoured!]</h3>
<h3><span><strong>If you look at fiscal and monetary politics in the Euro area today – what is your impression? Have the Europeans learnt a lesson from the Greek crisis?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>To begin with, please let us not conflate Europe’s rulers with the… Europeans. Turning now to your question, Europe’s leaders resemble the Bourbons: they have forgotten nothing and they have learned nothing. More precisely, while the ECB’s monetary policy reaction has been far improved since Mario Draghi succeeded the catastrophic Jean-Claude Trichet’s, monetary policy has long ago reached the limits of what it can do. So, the only thing that matters now is Europe’s fiscal stance.</h3>
<h3><span>Our fiscal stance remains the most tepid and the weakest amongst developed economies. It must be considered yet another dereliction of duty for two reasons, one ex ante and one ex post.</span></h3>
<h3>The ex ante failure has to do with what we are doing now, in 2020: Taking out all the loans provided to business (that are irrelevant fiscally), the fiscal injections into the EU economy are: (a) small overall and (b) hopelessly lopsided, with Germany on the one hand pumping a great deal more fiscal power into its economy while Italy and Spain cannot – the result being a magnification of Europe’s greatest weakness: our internal imbalances.</h3>
<h3>The ex post failure stems from the demise of the idea of a Eurobond – the only instrument that could prevent, in 2021 or 2022 (when the fiscal compact is re-energised) massive new austerity in countries like Italy and Spain. Since the budget deficit of these countries will exceed 10% of GDP, you can imagine that the fiscal consolidation necessary to return to the fiscal compact is going to produce a further increase in the imbalances that have been tearing the Eurozone apart since 2010.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>You are very critical of the European Recovery Fund. Why?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>For at least three important reasons: First, it was devised as a substitute to the Eurobond, which it is not. Secondly, because its structure is divisive and likely to cause greater disunity among Europeans. Thirdly, because it will be too little and it will come too late to counter-act the new austerity that the re-introduction of the fiscal compact will bring. Let me explain these three objections in greater detail.</h3>
<h3>While it is true that the Recovery Fund involves a degree of common debt, it is explicitly (and legally) designed as a one-off debt with specific details on how and when it will be repaid. Thus, we have wasted a fantastic opportunity to create the equivalent of US Treasury Bills, which is what makes the dollar powerful and the United States far better placed to absorb shocks.</h3>
<h3>Moreover, I am appalled that the Commission specified in advance, based on backward looking data, which country will receive how many billions. It was an awful thing to do because it set one country, one people, against another. What we needed was a sum that would be diverted to regions in Europe most in need of support. There are poor parts of Germany that will be hit more than richer parts of Spain. The total sum available should be distributed ex post on the basis of the needs of particular European regions and sectors, not by means of the usual sordid bargain in Brussels that divides a pie between governments.</h3>
<h3>Lastly, this Recovery Fund will do very little to ameliorate the austerity that the re-introduction of the fiscal compact will necessitate. It will fail in the same way that the many billions of the structural funds failed to ameliorate the effects of austerity between 2010 and 2016.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>What consequences will the Fund have in Europe?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>It will entrench the false view in Northern Europe that it was all about hand-outs to the Southerners while, at once, entrenching the false view in Europe’s South that the whole of the North benefits from pushing the South into greater impecunity.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>What will happen to the working class people in the Euro-Zone?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>It will continue to watch its prospects decline both in the North and in the South while the financiers and the members of the boards of directors of large companies enjoy the fruits of socialism for the oligarchy and stinging austerity for the majority of the Greeks and of the Germans.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>Will the consequences be different for Greece and Germany, aka South and North?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Yes and no. Workers in the North and in the South will be facing increasing precarity and will be getting angrier and more discontented. Except that the rate of deterioration will be much greater in countries like Greece, the result being the continuation of the mass exodus of young people which makes our countries of the South impossible to sustain as functioning societies.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>What role are the “frugal four” playing – isn’t it legitimate to keep in mind the public debt in each country?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Governments have a duty to defend their people from a number of threats. One of them is excessive public debt. But, there is also excessive private debt. And, even more ominously, low investment that jeopardises a nation’s chances to repay both private and public debt. The so-called frugal four are working in favour of large conglomerates that want their cake and to eat it: They like the effect Italy and Greece are having at keeping the exchange value of the euro low (so as to maximise their exports, eg, to China) and the interest rates below zero (so as to get free money from the ECB). Like all free-riders, they take what suits them but then take no responsibility for the damage that the policies favouring them do both to the South and to their own working classes (which find themselves increasingly squeezed and indebted as part of the same process that squeezes and indebts the South).</h3>
<h3><span><strong>You frequently speak of “oligarchs” – who are they in Europe?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>In the early fifties, when the EEC was first created, they were the captains of the steel and coal industries. Soon after, they were joined by the electrical goods industries plus the automakers. In the 1980s the captains of industry were increasingly sidelined by the bankers who, by 2008, had ended up as the masters of Europe’s destiny.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>Can the European oligarchs at least provide new jobs and/or be competitive with the US or China?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Absolutely not. The capacity of European financialised capitalism to produce good quality jobs is at its nadir and is getting worse and worse due to the EU’s failure to create the public finance instruments that DiEM25 has been proposing for years now – e.g. a joint European Investment Bank and European Central Bank program by which EIB-bonds can be backed by ECB-bonds to mobilise idle cash (that is currently destroying German pension funds) and turn it into green investments.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>Most observers have no doubt that there will be austerity in exchange of money from the fund. What austerity else can Greece bear, keeping in mind the sacrifices that have already been made?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>This is like asking a patient nearing death as a result of having been subjected to massive radiation how much more radiation she can take!</h3>
<h3><span><strong>What is the current state of the Greek economy? Debt is still at 180 percent, despite 200 billion Euro for bailing out the banks?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Greece’s debt is unpayable not despite but <u>because</u> of the banks’ bailout. Since 2009 I have been saying that Europe’s rulers, and this is where I do blame Mrs Merkel, cynically saved idiotic bankers by transferring their losses onto the shoulders of Europe’s weakest taxpayers. Mrs Merkel, Mr Sarkozy, the troika and everyone else who has maintained this crime-against-logic for a decade will forever by guilty in the conscience of Europe’s progressives. [And, by the way, Greece’s debt is not well about 200% of GDP!]</h3>
<h3><span><strong>What will Europe look like if the Recovery Fund really delivers on 750 billion Euro?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Sad and divided. For a start, of these 750 billions, 250 billions will be loans. The last thing Europe’s devasted businesses that are facing insolvency is more loans – Greece’s fate provides a great lesson to those who refuse to recognise this simple truth. As for the remaining 500 billions, more than 100 of them are re-purposed funds (i.e. not new money) and another 200 will be sacrificed to buy the frugal four’s consent. That leaves us with, at best, 300 billion. It sounds a lot but it is puny. Over three years it comes to less than 1% of GDP. Given that the austerity that Berlin will demand and Brussels will impose will be more than 4% of GDP over the same year, the only conclusion is that, as the pandemic (hopefully) subsides, European capitalism will be inflicting another unnecessary blow to itself – just as in 2010.</h3>
<h3><span><strong>In your view – what would be an adequate program to cope with the Corona-devastation?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>DiEM25 has already answered this – our <a href="https://diem25.org/diem25-presents-covid-19-economic-response-plan-and-green-recovery-investment-program/">3 point plan</a>.</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>The ECB must issue a long-maturity, 30-year, Eurobond for €1 trillion euros solely backed by the ECB,&nbsp;with the possibility of further issuance in needs be. This €1 trillion should then be used to replace national debt, in proportion to the coronavirus-induced regional recessions &amp; public health costs.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>The ECB must inject a €2000 European Solidarity Cash Payment to every European resident</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>The EU must create a European Green Recovery &amp; Investment Program funded by <em>EIB bonds&nbsp;approximately equal to 5% of the EU’s GDP, to be backed in the bond markets by the ECB</em>.</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><span><strong>You are talking about “class war”. Are we already there?</strong></span></h3>
<h3>We have been there since 2010. The austerity imposed upon Greece in May 2010 was the first move toward a fiscal …</h3></section></article></div></div>

                        <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591848729219073">hacks</a> are the last straw. We need to exit Twitter.</p><p>But you may be invested in Twitter! So what do you do? Here's one recipe for <em>gradual</em> exit.</p><ol><li>Step one is to set up an (optionally pseudonymous) newsletter at your <em>own</em> custom domain using the instructions <a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">here</a>. You can do this in an hour and maintain it for less than $30 per month. Then only tweet out posts from your site, using your domain name as a simple form of authentication.</li><li>Step two is to start building your membership list at your own site. If you want, help us review <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export">open source tools</a> to export your Twitter following to an email list and <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1284155565770498050">mass delete any DMs</a>.</li><li>And step three is to get off Twitter all together, and start building a decentralized media ecosystem that combines the sovereignty of individual domain names with the community of social networking. The v1 of that is a simple joint RSS feed that aggregates multiple independent newsletters, but we can get much more <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1280005821028397057">sophisticated</a> <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb">with</a> <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-state-of-the-art-of-decentralized-web-part-4-212732f74894">tech</a> <a href="https://gun.eco/docs/dWeb-The-Decentralized-Web">for</a> <a href="https://ens.domains/">the</a> <a href="https://handshake.org/">decentralized</a> <a href="https://ipfs.io/">web</a>. It may turn out that what we build helps reform Twitter itself, but at a minimum it will present an alternative.</li></ol><p>Before we get there though, let's go through the problems with Twitter.</p><h2 id="the-problems-with-twitter">The Problems with Twitter</h2><p>It's not just the hack. There are several overlapping issues with Twitter around security, authentication, pseudonymity, distribution, incentives, and culture.</p><ul><li><em>Twitter is insecure</em>. It was a mistake to think that personal security could compensate for the fundamental flaw of centralized web services: anyone who gains control over twitter.com gains control over your account. We knew this already from the <a href="http://archive.is/Bq5qi">2017 incident</a> and the <a href="http://archive.is/wip/scJMn">Jack Hack</a>. But now the most prominent people and companies in the world (Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Musk, Apple, Uber, among others) have been <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591848729219073">openly and publicly hacked</a>. Tomorrow you may be the victim. And unlike these worthies, you may be <em>silently</em> and <em>privately</em> hacked. Perhaps you already have been.</li><li><em>Twitter is not authenticated</em>. It was a mistake to trust Twitter's centralized verification process to validate everything posted to the service. There weren't any <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp#:~:text=A%20digital%20wallet%20stores%20the,to%20use%20the%20private%20key.">digital signatures</a> to help establish whether the messages were really coming from a user-controlled device, or faked by a central server.</li><li><em>Twitter is not fully pseudonymous</em>. It was a mistake to use our real names everywhere online, particularly on Twitter. It made us vulnerable to personal and physical attacks. Social media mobs can swarm your real name online and cancel you in real life. Doxxing can heighten the danger by making threats <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/reflections-upon-a-swatting/">materialize in</a> <a href="https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md">meatspace</a>. Pseudonymity is a better default, especially now that we can <a href="http://www.marknagelberg.com/notes-on-the-pseudonymous-economy-balaji-srinivasan/">earn under a pseudonym</a>.</li><li><em>Twitter is a distribution chokepoint</em>. It was a mistake to outsource our distribution to Twitter. Twitter users don't fully control their reach, brand, or monetization. You can be <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-reveals-how-it-ranks-tweets-in-search-results/263869/">downranked</a> or <a href="http://archive.is/mhgyB">deplatformed</a> at any time, just like you can on YouTube and other centralized platforms. Owning your <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465992-How-do-I-export-my-email-or-subscriber-list-">own</a> <a href="http://locals.com/">email</a> <a href="https://ghost.org/members">list</a> is a far better alternative.</li><li><em>Twitter doesn't create wealth</em>. It was a mistake to have so many people spending so much time on something that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1271834488998440961">arguably</a> destroys more wealth than it creates. Because by default, you don't create wealth on Twitter. You may create wealth <em>for</em> Twitter, or for the media corporations whose links are circulated, but not for yourself or for others. There's no sense of economic alignment with other users, no sense of mutual obligation.</li><li><em>Twitter turns society into Twitter</em>. It was a mistake to let Twitter set up the incentives for our society. It's not good for the world when the one thing every prominent person knows how to do is <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1272653587617701888">fight</a> each other on Twitter for likes and followers. It has converted society into a zero-sum status game played by elites with real consequences. Every day, blue checks compete for a finite pie of attention with ever more sensational posts. There is instant feedback on what is popular, but none on what is true. The lack of economics, the presence of real names, the toxic culture, and the UX itself all encourage constant fighting.</li></ul><p>Now, let me qualify these comments. I personally have gotten <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1271834488998440961">enormous value</a> out of Twitter, despite all the points above. After all, you only critique the services you use!</p><p>And to be clear, Jack Dorsey is a phenomenal entrepreneur. I respect everything he's done and the team that he's built. It's hard to build one multibillion dollar company, let alone <a href="http://archive.is/wip/bu6hJ">two</a>. He's done immense good for the world overall, both through his <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1247616214769086465">personal generosity</a> and his startup vehicles. And I also don't wish any Twitter employee ill, as many of them are truly great people and I know how hard this stuff is.</p><p>Moreover, even after this hack, Twitter will likely continue to be an important internet battlefield for quite sometime. It's just too easy, too convenient. And it may turn out that whatever is built to exit Twitter will end up interfacing with Twitter itself, via their <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky">decentralized protocol</a>, if only as a form of training wheels to help people get off. Hopefully this can be done in a win-win way, such that Twitter and its employees are incentivized to allow people to gradually exit and fix the issues on the centralized service.</p><p>But it's past time for us to start building something better, that keeps the good aspects of Twitter (the serendipitous learning, the fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1214585024772788224">people</a>) but filters the bad. That may mean exiting to our own domains and then networking them into decentralized media.</p><h2 id="decentralization-starts-with-a-domain">Decentralization Starts with a Domain</h2><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Can we network together websites into decentralized media with something deeper than links?</figcaption></figure><p>I may be wrong about this, but I don't think a "better Twitter" starts with a service which is simply a clone of Twitter except with a different community. I think it starts with a community of independent (and independently monetizable) domains that we network together in novel ways, to build <em>decentralized media</em>.</p><p>Towards this end, the first step in gradually exiting Twitter is to set up your own paid newsletter at a custom domain (<a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">instructions here</a>) and restrict yourself mainly to tweeting out posts. This does require more effort than writing 280 characters! But that's why it's good. Effort helps restore your attention span and improves average post quality. And in addition to the other benefits, the link to your domain doubles as a simple alternative to a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp#:~:text=A%20digital%20wallet%20stores%20the,to%20use%20the%20private%20key.">digital signature</a>, a way for people to see that the content is authentically yours. </p><p>The medium-term step is to develop <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export">tools</a> to migrate your followers off Twitter to an email list, and to mass delete all DMs as a precautionary step. If you want to help review some existing tools towards this end, we're working on it <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export/issues/1">here</a>.</p><p>The long-term step is to start addressing the issues with Twitter by knitting these individual domains together into an open source decentralized media ecosystem. That means addressing:</p><ul><li>Security by encouraging people to post from their own domains</li><li>Community by building a network around multiple domains</li><li>Authentication by combining domains with digital signatures</li><li>Distribution via memberships and email lists</li><li>Incentives by baking in monetization and economic alignment from the beginning</li><li>Mobs by recommending pseudonymity by default</li><li>Culture by encouraging physical norms of civility</li></ul><p>Crucially, unlike past efforts our goal would be to build this <em>community-first</em> rather than <em>technology-first</em>. Specifically, once we get enough paid newsletters set up at their own domains, we can experiment with new decentralized web technologies for linking them together. If you submit your URL to <a href="https://forms.gle/xqvAFgW43Hc7rVzJA">this form</a>, we'll see if we can form a community. We'll probably start with a joint <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feed and then <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/">get more sophisticated</a>.</p><p>Oh, and you can signal that you're interested in decentralized media by changing your name on Twitter to your URL, as <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">follows</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Exiting Twitter and building decentralized media will be a long project and we aren't assured of success. But this journey of a thousand miles begins with a single newsletter at your own domain! So <a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">set yours up</a> now. </p><p>It's time to start gradually exiting Twitter.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

<p><em>Why it failed and why i’m releasing all the source code for free.</em></p>



<div><p>This is a long post.</p><p>If you are just looking for the code click <a href="#the-code">here</a></p></div>



<p>When lockdown started in the U.K I started looking for ways to spend my extended time at home. I wasn’t working because I had quit my job on Feb 16th to travel the world. Timing has never been my strong suit. </p>



<p>So instead of sitting around I decided to start a contracting company, got awarded a few small contracts and I released a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nitronotes/id1502080216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">few</a> <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://apps.apple.com/dz/app/countdownplusplus/id1497707393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">apps</a> written in SwiftUI. But I wanted a bigger project to sink my teeth into. </p>



<p>There were two ideas I kept coming back too;</p>



<ol><li>A hosted org-mode in the browser. </li><li>Some sort of local social network.</li></ol>



<p>Given that everyone was forced into their home I thought it would be the perfect time for something like the app <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yik_Yak" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YikYak</a> to make a comeback. </p>



<h3>Ghosts of apps past.</h3>



<p>For those who never got a chance to use YikYak let me try to explain it quickly. The app touted itself as the first hyperlocal social network. A users post could only be viewed it if you were no further than 5km <a href="https://adamfallon.com/2020/07/10/recreating-yikyak-with-postgres/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the initial post location</a>. You could vote posts up or down and comment underneath posts. It was simple but unique.</p>



<p>YikYak eventually implemented some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yikyak/comments/8sgynk/what_exactly_caused_the_fall_of_yik_yak/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">very unpopular changes</a>. Bullying, Racism and Doxxing was always a problem on YikYak. They didn’t do a huge deal to moderate the content on the app, instead leaving the community to self-police. Eventually they had to do <strong><em>something</em></strong> so they enforced email or telephone signups. </p>



<p><em>Cue mass exodus of users</em>.</p>



<h3>Introducing Ottr 🦦</h3>



<p>So I began work on Ottr in early February.</p>



<p>Ottr was going to be YikYak for the people in lockdown. In the same way TikTok came from the ashes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vine</a> – Ottr was to be the refinement of the ideas behind YikYak.</p>







<p>A user could create a new post and comment underneath other posts. They could upvote or downvote posts. They could click the Explore button and whisk off to a new location. You could share posts to Reddit or Twitter. I got all of these features working in a web app created in React, and an iOS app. It got funding from the Amazon Activate program.</p>

<p>But as of today Ottr is dead. I’m going to talk about why I no longer believe in the idea, the key failures that lead to that decision and why I am releasing absolutely everything I made.</p>



<h3>On anonymity.</h3>



<p>For all its flaws – I absolutely loved YikYak. It came out the first year of my bachelors degree. It was by far the most used app on campus. I would be sitting in the university library and someone would post about the weird smell coming from the desks on the 3rd floor. Or the little nod the doorman would give you on your way in. </p>



<p>People would post about the crazy antics of their friend on a drunken night out. About the cute doggo’s in the parks. Or how awful the food from the students union was. Maybe they would post about their crush.</p>



<p>Those posting on YikYak were having the same experience you were. They were seeing the same things as you, and that made you feel engaged. It was anonymous, which ended up being a double edge sword. It allowed for great humour and creativity, but sometimes the jokes went too far.</p>



<p>Anonymity would be YikYak’s greatest strength and its most fundamental weakness. </p>



<h3>And yet…</h3>



<p>People got hurt using YikYak. Anonymity breeds toxicity – there are clear precedents for this on the internet – 4chan, 8chan and Reddit. </p>



<p>I knew that there was potential for this to happen again – but I thought I could solve it. My thought process was; </p>



<ul><li>I will add a report button and over time I can just add moderators to keep on top of the reports.</li><li>Posts will be removed when they get downvoted too much.</li><li>I will redact PPI and add profanity filters.</li></ul>



<p>This arrogance was mistake number 1. When I eventually let a few people use the site they broke the profanity filters with ease. Even among ~100 users people wrote spam and cluttered up the front page. Going on the site in the first week made me wince at how ugly it looked, with people filling the character limit with posts consisting entirely of emoji. It made the site look amateur.</p>



<p>Moderation on the internet is an unsolved problem. Handing the moderation over to automated systems will mean bias can creep in, and it’s hard (impossible?) to tune between zealotry and permissiveness. With an automated system you are going to upset some people. </p>



<h3>Humans &gt; Robots?</h3>



<p>Humans are better at moderation, but they cost much more money and come with their own problems. I think the shining example of human moderation is Hacker News. Daniel Gackle and Scott Bell tackle the problems inherit of internet forums with a competence not seen elsewhere.</p>



<p>The New Yorker wrote <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-lonely-work-of-moderating-hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this</a> great article about how difficult that is to achieve – and that’s with Hacker News having a <em>distinct voice</em>. Hacker News is a place for people to post about things that are intellectually interesting to hackers. </p>



<p>Ottr didn’t have a clear voice – it was a place for people to post about things going on in their community. That could mean anything.</p>



<p>Something that is acceptable in one location, might not work for people elsewhere. You could have moderators from each community – but then you are giving that moderator a lot of power to make others unhappy. </p>



<p>I think Reddit is a horrible place for new posters – and part of the blame falls on moderators having too much power. Some moderators on Reddit have so much power they can control the front page, and with that, the tone of the site. I <em>really</em> didn’t want that.</p>



<h3>It appears we’re at an impasse.</h3>



<p>So if humans and robots couldn’t be trusted, what could? Ottr made the same compromise YikYak did – of letting the community police itself – and it failed (I think) because too few people used Ottr. </p>



<p>A self policing community has great potential to trend towards its worst elements. If someone posted something false about me on the internet, I would have great incentive to downvote it – but why would anyone else – especially when there was the potential for scandal, entertainment and outrage.</p>



<p>I care about how the site looks to first time users, but why would anyone else?</p>



<p>And so those stupid emoji posts stayed on the front page.</p>



<h3>Is anybody alive out there?</h3>



<p>So poor moderation options left Ottr open to the same kinds of toxicity that YikYak failed to combat. The second key issue was the fact that <em>I don’t know how to get people to use Ottr in the first place</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve never read a book on growth hacking or how to make your product sticky. I kind of understand when its happening to me (“Hand over your contacts to get some shiny coins?”, “How about you share this post on Facebook and Twitter?”, “Our site is restricting registrations at this time – Sign up with your email to be notified when we have an opening?”), but it always rubbed me the wrong way. </p>



<p>I wanted a few people to start using Ottr and then they would be so blown away by how good it was that they would tell their friends and share it themselves. </p>



<h3>Build it and they will come?</h3>



<p>I focused on UX simplicity and features and the idea of getting people to use it was always running on a low priority background thread. Instead of getting the first iteration up and focusing on what people said about that, I had a clear vision of what it was to be like, what I would add from YikYak, what I would change, and then I would hand it to the people and they would say “Yes Adam – very good, thank you!”.</p>



<p>Treating user growth as a secondary concern is the dumbest thing you can do for a social network. It is <em>all that matters.</em> Mistake #2 was thinking I was above this somehow. I treated growth-hacking and user-growth as something for other people to be concerned with. That is a juvenile approach to business. Because I can code doesn’t mean that I am somehow too pure to engage in the business of marketing or advertising the things I code. </p>



<p>I am working on fixing that this year and i’m trying to understand, rather than scoff, at the ideas behind growing and marketing the things I make. So far it seems much more difficult than learning to code. I didn’t understand or appreciate this until I reflected on the time I spent on Ottr.</p>



<h3>Burn, Baby Burn.</h3>



<p>By copying the mistakes of YikYak and ignoring the fundamentals behind making a social network work it meant that Ottr never got off the ground. You might argue that I didn’t try for very long – and you are right, I didn’t, around 4 months in total. Mistake #3 is the real reason I wanted to be done with the whole project. I was completely burnt out.</p>



<p>As I mentioned before, I had just quit my job in February to travel. For reasons I won’t go in to, consuming myself with Ottr directly after leaving my last job was a really bad idea. </p>



<p>As I couldn’t travel because of the pandemic and because I had already planned for my mini-retirement I had enough money that meant I didn’t need to jump into another job. The contract work I was getting was not very engaging – so I suddenly had a lot of free time. </p>



<p>So I threw myself into Ottr. I remember looking at ScreenTime stats at the time and it showing emacs being open for 80+ hrs a week. I stopped reading. Stopped watching movies. From waking up to going to sleep i’d just be working on it. Ottr went through a few iterations and I threw huge chunks of work away at points. </p>



<h3>Then the wheels came off.</h3>



<p>Then one fine day it all stopped being worth it. I was riding along on a wave of getting the next feature done. Talking to a partner at Amazon helping with deployment. Tinkering with CloudFlare because I thought now it’s going into production, I will obviously be inundated. But when it came time where it was actually “ready”, I became immediately repulsed of the idea of trying to grow Ottr. </p>



<p>Doubt crept in. “This is just a copy of YikYak”, and it was, but YikYak doesn’t exist anymore. There is nothing new under the sun.</p>



<p>No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t …</p></div></div></div>

<p>While QEMU started out as a platform for emulating hardware (especially
architectures not supported by the host CPU), later versions gained the ability
to execute code using hardware-assisted virtualization. This can yield
substantial performance benefits, since most executed opcodes are performed
directly by the CPU, instead of being translated into a number of native
opcodes that simulate the behavior of the original one.</p>
<p>Using virtualization requires a host CPU that supports the executing
architecture. On an Intel-based machine (such as those we used for developing
our iOS on QEMU project), virtualizing an architecture other than x86/x64
would be impossible. Therefore, when running iOS (an arm64 OS) on QEMU, we’d be
using regular emulation. At first, the performance was more than adequate. But
as our efforts to execute iOS on QEMU developed, and more parts of the
operating system were brought up successfully, we started noticing degraded
performance.</p>
<p>Modern ARM chips support hardware-assisted virtualization, similar to their x86
bretheren. If we were to run our version of QEMU on an ARM-based system, it
should be possible to harness the virtualization capabilites of the underlying
CPU in order to achieve near-native performance. This post documents the
challenges we had to overcome in order to successfully boot our iOS system on
QEMU using hardware-assisted virtualization.</p>

<p>When moving away from an Intel-based laptop to an ARM-based system for
development, the first question was, which platform to choose. Should we use an
ARM server in the cloud? An ARM-based development board? A developer-friendly
Android phone? Each of the options seemed to have its advantages.</p>
<p>An ARM server would easily be the most powerful of the bunch - but the
selection of ARM-based dedicated servers is limited, they aren’t cheap, and we
weren’t sure we’d get the level of access we’d need (our assumption was that
recompiling the kernel would be required). Buying a physical server is an
option we entertained for a short while, but with prices in the thousands of
dollars, the idea was quickly discarded.</p>
<p>A used Android phone was another good candidate, but even developer-friendly
phones might be difficult to work with. Using Android instead of a
general-purpose Linux could be a limiting factor - and finding a phone with
enough RAM to execute iOS in parallel with a full-blown Android environment
would require us to go with a recent phone, which would not be cheap.</p>
<p>An ARM-based development board looked like a good choice, that would let us
test and develop our code at a fraction of the price of the alternatives.
Looking for good aftermarket support for kernel development, 64-bit ARM SOCs,
and no less than 4GB of RAM, we chose Pine Rock64 as our testbed:</p>
<p><img src="https://alephsecurity.com/assets/img/qemu-kvm/pine64_rock64_angle_53e8db18-d784-4a66-879b-e413d4e50c3c_550x350.webp" alt="Pine Rock64"></p>
<p>The board comes with an arm64 CPU (Cortex-A53-based RK3328), as well as 4GB of
RAM. The choice seemed perfect for our purpose: when emulating an iPhone, we
successfully used Cortex-A53 as our CPU, and while 4GB of RAM wasn’t ideal
(we’d usually run our emulation with 6GB of RAM dedicated to QEMU), our tests
indicated that using less RAM (for example, 2GB) had no significant impact at
this point.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-kvm-in-qemu">Enabling KVM in QEMU</h2>
<p>Once our board was up and running the latest version of Armbian, it was time
for our first attempt to run QEMU while using hardware-assisted virtualization
of the CPU in place of emulation. In theory, one simply has to add the
<code>-enable-kvm</code> switch to the command line…</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t that easy. While QEMU launched successfully, iOS
wouldn’t boot. Attaching gdb on boot let us see the instructions we executing
correctly at first, but upon continuing, we’d quickly find ourselves in an
infinite loop located at <code>0xfffffff0070a0200</code>. Based on the kernel symbols, it
was one of the vectors for interrupt/exception handling. Reaching that code
meant an exception occured early on, and the operating system still hasn’t
reached a point where it could be handled more gracefully (such as dumping
registers and memory content, combined with at least some sort of the issue
description). We had no choice but to step through the early initialization
of the kernel, one instruction after the other, until the jump to the exception
vector occured.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-the-mmu">Enabling the MMU</h2>
<p>At this point, it’s important to note, that when the kernel is loaded for the
first time, the MMU isn’t enabled yet, and the code is mapped to physical
addresses (the execution begins at <code>0x470a5098</code>). It is only later during the
initialization that the MMU is enabled (once the page tables are initialized),
and the addresses switch to the familiar kernel mode (with higher bits set to
1). When looking at the kernel image in a disassembler such as Ghidra, however,
all code is mapped to kernel addresses. Therefore, the initialization code we
were inspecting could be found at <code>0xfffffff0070a5098</code>.</p>
<p>Some of the initialization code contains loops that execute many times. In
order to make following the execution more effective, we used breakpoints that
we set at small intervals. This let us continue the execution, instead of
stepping through each instruction and loop. Using this technique, we quickly
found out the exception occured at the address <code>0x470a72e4</code>:</p>
<pre><code>0x470a72d4     msr      vbar_el1, x0
0x470a72d8     movz     x0, 0x593d
0x470a72dc     movz     x1, 0x3454, lsl 16
0x470a72e0     orr      x0, x0, x1
0x470a72e4 ==&gt; msr      sctlr_el1, x0
0x470a72e8     isb
0x470a72ec     movz     x0, 0
0x470a72f0     msr      tpidr_el1, x0
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, at the mentioned address, the value <code>0x3454593d</code> is written into
the <code>SCTLR_EL1</code> register. As per ARM DDI 0487, D13.2.113, this is the system
control register, that provides a top level control of the system at EL0 and
EL1. Its first bit is used to enable address translation via the MMU. Since the
exception happens when executing this instruction (and bit 0 is set in the new
value for the register), the address translation configuration was an immediate
suspect.</p>
<p>There are several registers used to configure the MMU - namely, <code>TCR_EL1</code>,
<code>TTBR1_EL1</code>, and <code>MAIR_EL1</code>. We inspected the values stored in those registers
prior to enabling the MMU. One field that stood out was <code>TCR_EL1.TG1</code>, that
indicates the granule size for the <code>TTBR1_EL1</code>. The initialization code of our
iOS kernel sets the value of <code>TCR_EL1.TG1</code> to <code>0b01</code> (the field is stored in
bits 31:30, and the value written to <code>TCR_EL1</code> at <code>0x470a7244</code> is
<code>0x000000226519a519</code>). The value of <code>0b01</code> corresponds to a granule size of
16KB.</p>
<p>Notably, after stepping through the <code>msr</code> instruction at <code>0x470a7244</code>,
inspecting the value of <code>TCR_EL1</code> revealed a slightly different value of
<code>0x00000022a519a519</code> - the granule size was read out as <code>0b10</code> (4KB)! This made
the reason for an exception upon enabling the MMU clear: while the page tables
set up by the initalization code were designed with a 16KB granule size in
mind, the actual granule size stored in <code>TCR_EL1</code> when enabling the MMU was set
to 4KB. The MMU treated the page entries incorrectly, and a page fault occured
immediately upon enabling the MMU. But why would the value we attempted to set,
that of a 16KB granule, wouldn’t stick?</p>
<p>ARM DDI has the following to say about setting the value of <code>TCR_EL1.TG</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>If the value is programmed to either a reserved value, or a size that has not been implemented, then the hardware will treat the field as if it has been programmed to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED choice of the sizes that has been implemented for all purposes other than the value read back from this register.

It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the value read back is the value programmed or the value that corresponds to the size chosen.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In our case, <code>TCR_EL1.TG</code> is read back as <code>0b10</code> after attempting to set it to
<code>0b01</code>. This indicates that in our case, the read back value is one that
corresponds to the granule size chosen (since it’s not the value we
programmed), and that the 16KB size has not been implemented in our CPU. We can
verify this assumption with the help of the <code>ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1</code> register
(AArch64 Memory Model Feature Register 0). Its field TGran16 (at bits 23:20)
is used to indicate support for 16KB memory translation granule size: when the
bits are all set to 0, the granule size is <em>not</em> supported. Reading the value
of the register on our Rock64 developer board returns the value of
<code>0x00001122</code> - thus, bits 23:20 are set to zero, and our CPU doesn’t implement
the 16KB granule size. In fact, by referring to section 4.2.1 in ARM DDI 0500
(ARM Cortex-A53 MPCore Processor Technical Reference Manual), we can see that
the value of <code>0x00001122</code> is there by design - i.e., Cortex-A53 cores do not
implement the 16KB granule size. Interestingly, the Cortex-A53 implementation
in QEMU ignores this, and implements the 16KB granule size (the value of
<code>ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1</code> is <code>0x00001122</code>, matching the reference manual, but setting
<code>TCR_EL1.TG</code> to <code>0b01</code> works as intended).</p>
<p>We had several options for the continuation of the project. We briefly
considered patching the iOS kernel to use 4KB or 64KB pages, both supported by
Cortex-A53. This idea was quickly dropped, as it requires a lot of effort,
while its probability of success is questionable. While building the initial
page table with different page sizes should be doable, we’d have to find all
the places in the kernel code that manipulate the page table, and update them
accordingly - not an easy feat to accomplish.</p>
<p>We, therefore, had to switch to an ARM core that supports 16KB pages. This
brought us back to the choice of a hardware (ARM server, development board, or
a phone), with one more requirement to fullfil: we’d look up the technical
reference manual of the core powering the chosen hardware, and verify the
granule size used by the iOS kernel is supported.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most budget development boards use older ARM cores (either
Cortex-A53 or Cortex-A72), with no support for the required granule size. We
found one board with a core that had the required support - but it only had
1GB of RAM. Most Android phones …</p></div></div>

		<h2>The Truth About Disroot</h2>
<h3>1. Disroot may be a criminal organization</h3>
<p>Disroot offers a data retention policy that is illegal in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>On 9/18/19 attackers who identified themselves as connected with Disroot DDOS’ed Privacy-watchdog.io.&nbsp; They tried to use bullying and harassment to get us to take down this page. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://privacy-watchdog.io/the-disroot-ddos-attack-of-9-18-19/">read more about it here.</a>&nbsp; Disroot has not disavowed this attack.&nbsp; This illustrates that Disroot is run by people who engage in illegal cyberwarfare.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Disroot’s code and security architecture are below average</strong></h3>
<p>Disroot says their code is open source and they say you can review it on <a href="https://www.rainloop.net/">Rainloops</a> GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/RainLoop/rainloop-webmail">here</a>.&nbsp; But Rainloop is an independent corporation and Disroot is only one many groups who use it. Rainloop is <strong>not</strong> marketed and not intended for security or privacy. Rainloops website markets itself as “decent performance, simple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rainloop.net/docs/installation/">installation”.</a>&nbsp; It’s so simple it <a href="https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-rainloop-webmail-on-ubuntu-18-04/">reportedly takes less than 10 minutes</a> to set up, <a href="https://www.rainloop.net/docs/installation/">here’s the guide</a>.&nbsp; Or follow a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-97oZC1nD4">12 min youtube video</a>.&nbsp; It’s so simple that hundreds of clubs and groups use Rainloop.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;local mom groups,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.rs/">Cyberpunk</a> sites, <a href="http://app.g-p.co.jp/webmail/">food</a> stores, <a href="http://rimwd.com/">advertising agencies</a>, <a href="https://webmail.uberspace.de/">hosting</a> services, kids clothes stores, <a href="https://crazytutorials.be/">tutorial sites</a>, <a href="http://egomail.egorealestate.com/">real estate services</a>, and <a href="https://webmail.ilait.se/">cloud computing retailers</a>.</p>
<p>Disroot depends on Rainloop for its security and to provide updates.&nbsp; That’s a problem because Rainloop has only worked <a href="https://github.com/RainLoop?tab=overview&amp;from=2018-12-01&amp;to=2018-12-31">12 days</a> in 2018 and <a href="https://github.com/RainLoop?tab=overview&amp;from=2019-09-01&amp;to=2019-09-20">18 days</a> in 2019.&nbsp; They have <a href="https://github.com/RainLoop/rainloop-webmail/issues">739 open bugs</a>, fixes and issues that are “Pending”.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rainloop is not well maintained, it is not designed for privacy or security and it has security issues unfixed.&nbsp; When you use Disroot this is what you’re getting.</p>
<p>Disroot says they offer built-in encrypted email however that’s misleading.&nbsp; They provide TLS/SSL encryption. This is what everyone uses and it’s average.&nbsp; &nbsp;You’re using the same email security that everyone uses.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>All emails are saved as plain text on their server.&nbsp; They offer an add on “option” to encrypt emails server side.&nbsp; But Disroot gets all of those emails in Plain text and you have to trust that they won’t read them.&nbsp; Be careful trusting Disroot because the evidence suggests they are a criminal organization (more on that below).&nbsp; They also know your private key and password so if they wanted to read your encrypted emails they could with ease.</p>
<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Disroot misrepresents their company and pays for biased reviews</strong></h3>
<p>The website leads a visitor to believe it is a volunteer-run community.&nbsp; However, Disroot contradicts this statement when they say they are actually a non-profit company.&nbsp; This is what most secure email services do to avoid taxes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Disroot’s claim of being a “volunteer-run organization” is just clever marketing.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are the same type of non-profit company everyone else is.</p>
<p>The Disroot NPO Company earns revenue from donations and through <a href="https://graphtreon.com/creator/disroot">Patreon</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://archive.fo/TNEvf">Archive</a>).&nbsp; With their tax-free revenue they purchase <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/disroot-encrypted-email-cloud/">good reviews</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://archive.fo/lwiVZ">Archive</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dannalbright.com/">Dan Albright</a> who’s goal is to “<a href="https://www.dannalbright.com/">make you (and your company) look great!</a>“.&nbsp; This would explain why his article is biased toward Disroot calling it “The Best Private Encrypted Email”.&nbsp; The reality is Disroot privacy and encryption are very mediocre at best.&nbsp; It’s not a good sign when a company has to pay people to say good things about them.</p>
<p>Disroot also seems to have purchased a whole page of good reviews from a site called “<a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/email.html">Digdeeper</a>” (<a href="https://archive.fo/zTYYL">Archive</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone reviewing <a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/email.html">Digdeeper</a> can feel how biased it is towards promoting Disroot.&nbsp; Digdeeper also attempts to elevate Disroot by shitting on all the other email services,<a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/email.html"> see for yourself</a>.&nbsp; Digdeeper recommends two other webmail services called Riseup and Autistici.&nbsp; The majority of security &amp; privacy experts will tell you to <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/email/">avoid</a> those two sites, at all costs, because of their history with Law Enforcement.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Disroots has serious legal issues that affect their users</strong></h3>
<p>Disroot’s users are also bound by <a href="https://www.rainloop.net/licensing/">Rainloops Terms of Service</a>.&nbsp; Rainloop is a US-based company with terms of service that could imply they send your data to US datacenters.</p>
<p><img src="https://privacy-watchdog.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Disroot-IP-1-266x300.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="300" srcset="https://privacy-watchdog.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Disroot-IP-1-266x300.jpg 266w, https://privacy-watchdog.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Disroot-IP-1-768x867.jpg 768w, https://privacy-watchdog.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Disroot-IP-1-300x339.jpg 300w, https://privacy-watchdog.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Disroot-IP-1-850x960.jpg 850w, https://privacy-watchdog.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Disroot-IP-1.jpg 865w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px"></p>
<p>You can discover Disroot’s datacenter by following their webmail IP address (179.21.23.139) which will lead you to “<a href="https://serverius.net/">Serverius’</a>.&nbsp; If you use Disroot your data is stored in a server owned by Serverious and their privacy policy applies to your data.&nbsp; Serveritus says they record all traffic data for up to 5 years and they may turn it over to law enforcement within “reasonable discretion” without notifying Disroot.</p>
<p>All users data is stored in the Netherlands.&nbsp; The Netherlands are inside the 14-eyes but what’s worse is Edward Snowden said the Dutch are the “Surveillance Kings of Europe”.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dutch law requires companies to retain all users personal data for 6 months.&nbsp; When you press “Delete” on an email Disroot is legally required to keep a backup for 6 months.&nbsp; But that’s only if your lucky and&nbsp; That also means Disroot is legally required to record IP addresses for 6 months.&nbsp; In 2014 the European Court of Justice (ECJ)&nbsp; declared this data collection to be a violation of rights and said the law was invalid.&nbsp; But the ECJ is not a dutch organization and the Dutch government continues the data retention laws stating they are required to “fight terror”.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Disroot is a Law Enforcement “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)">Honey Pot</a>” or will be soon</strong></h3>
<p>There used to be a server that provided a similar service as Disroot that was set up for a criminal group’s private use.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dutch-police-snoop-on-criminal-chats-by-intercepting-encryption-server/">Dutch hijacked it</a> (<a href="https://archive.fo/2qjdy">Archive</a>) and recorded everything coming in and out. They also hijacked and ran the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hansa-dutch-police-sting-operation/">Hansa Market</a> for a few months.&nbsp; Based on the history of Dutch law enforcement I think Disroot is currently compromised by Dutch law enforcement.&nbsp; If they are not currently compromised then they will be soon.&nbsp; Remember, CIA officials have said, “There’s no such thing as intelligence sharing, There is only intelligence trading.”&nbsp; And Disroot could provide massive amounts of data to “trade” if compromised and it would be extremely easy to do.</p>
<p>Disroot offers a data retention policy that is illegal in the Netherlands.&nbsp; This gives Dutch law enforcement an easy way to hijack Disroot’s whole email service.&nbsp; They do not need a court order to take over Disroots services because Disroot is offering features that are illegal.&nbsp; And when Disroot is compromised 100% of your data will be recorded by law enforcement because of their weak security architecture.&nbsp; At that point, it’s only a matter of time before your plain text Disroot emails are stored right next to your Gmail emails within the massive Utah NSA data center.</p>

		<p><strong>1.Protonmail Behaves like a CIA/NSA “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)">Honeypot</a>”</strong></p>
<p>Protonmail has an <a href="https://protonirockerxow.onion/">Onion domain</a> that allows users to visit their site using the TOR browser.&nbsp; Protonmail even has an SSL cert for that onion address even though it’s completely unnecessary. When a user makes a new account with Protonmail on TOR they are re-directed from Protonmail’s “.onion” to “.com” address.&nbsp; This breaks your secure encrypted connection to their onion address, enabling your identification.&nbsp; There are absolutely no technical reasons for this feature.&nbsp; In fact, the only other websites that operate like this are suspected NSA/CIA Honeypots.</p>
<p>This is a huge security issue that was either created because Protonmail is managed by Particle physicists who do not understand computer security OR they have been forced to operate their website in a similar way as CIA/NSA honeypots. Both possibilities are serious concerns.</p>
<p><strong>2. Protonmail Does Not Provide “End to End Encryption”</strong></p>
<p>Professor Nadim Kobeissi mathematically <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1121.pdf">proved</a> that Protonmail does not provide End to End Encryption. Meaning, Protonmail has the ability to decrypt their own user’s data.&nbsp; When this was shown to be true, Protonmail users were outraged they had been lied to.&nbsp;<a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/cryptographic-architecture-response/"> Protonmail was forced to issue a public statement</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Their statement begins like you would expect it would..&nbsp; by shitting on the security researcher that revealed their dishonesty.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they continued to say:&nbsp; “We lied to our users because other email companies did”.&nbsp; &nbsp;No apologies.&nbsp; They can decrypt any of their user’s data be sending them scripts that allow them to do so.&nbsp; However they advertise that they can not.&nbsp; <strong>Protonmail’s <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/cryptographic-architecture-response/">admission</a> proves they offer the same security that Gmail offers.&nbsp;</strong> Both Gmail and Protonmail offer encryption that they can decrypt whenever they want.</p>
<p><b>3. Protonmail’s Was Created Under CIA/NSA Oversight</b></p>
<p>Gmail &amp; Protonmail were both created in CIA/NSA funded departments with their oversight.&nbsp; Protonmail has tried to hide this part of their history. <a href="https://privacy-watchdog.io/protonmails-creation-with-cia-nsa/">We wrote a whole article about it here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4.Protonmai</strong><strong>l is Part Owned by CRV and the Swiss Government</strong></p>
<p>After a successful crowdfunding campaign with promises to “remain independent” Protonmail <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-has-raised-2m-usd-to-protect-online-privacy/">sold equity ownership</a> to <a href="https://www.crv.com/">CRV</a> and <a href="https://fongit.ch/about-us/">FONGIT</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;At the time of the equity sale a CRV founder, Mr Ted Ditersmith, was working for the US State Department closely with President Obama.&nbsp; His position as a delegate required close contact with CIA &amp; NSA administration.&nbsp; Mr. Ted Ditersmith had also witnessed the Edward Snowden revelations and made statements that he planned to use his corporate knowledge to “fight terrorism”.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://fongit.ch/">FONGIT</a> is a Non Profit organization that is <a href="https://fongit.ch/about-us/">financed by the Swiss Government</a>. Protonmail staff member, <a href="https://protonmail.com/about">Antonio Gambardella</a>, also works for the Swiss Government.</p>
<p><strong>5. CRV, In-Q-Tel &amp; the CIA</strong></p>
<p>The CIA openly operates a front company,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel">In-Q-Tel</a>, whose stated purpose is to invest in tech companies on behalf of the CIA. In-Q-Tel has stated they have a specific interest in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/business/suddenly-uncle-sam-wants-to-bankroll-you.html">information contained in e-mails</a><u> and encrypted communication.</u>&nbsp;In-Q-Tel has been shown to be the&nbsp;bridge between the <a href="https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/how-the-cia-made-google-e836451a959e">CIA and Gmail</a>.&nbsp; An analysis of staff members reveals CRV &amp; In-Q-Tel connections.&nbsp; The US media confirms these connections when they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/business/suddenly-uncle-sam-wants-to-bankroll-you.html">interview CRV</a> so that they can understand In-Q-Tel.&nbsp; Additionally, The mastermind, cryptographer &amp; back end developer that created Protonmail, Wei Sun,<a href="https://angel.co/wei-sun-7"> now works for Google.</a></p>
<p><strong>6. Protonmail Follows CIA Email format &amp; Metadata Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Leaked documents at Wikileaks show that the CIA requires emails to be stored as an EML filetype.&nbsp; There are several ways to store emails, and Protonmail has selected the format that the CIA requires.&nbsp; Protonmail offers no protection for users’ metadata and has officially stated that they turn metadata over to Law Enforcement.&nbsp; Edward Snowden revealed that the US government cares least about the content of emails.&nbsp; Mr. Snowden revealed the US Law Enforcement cares most about who a person is talking to, the dates &amp; times of the emails, and the subject of the email. &nbsp;Subject and metadata encryption are not difficult to provide.&nbsp; However, Protonmail refuses to offer any protection on data that is most valuable to the CIA &amp; FBI and they store it as plain text (No encryption). Edward Snowden stated the NSA “isn’t able to compromise the encryption algorithms underlying these technologies. Instead, it circumvents or undermines them by <a href="https://mashable.com/2013/09/05/snowden-nsa-break-internet-encryption/">forcing companies to cooperate in other ways</a>.&nbsp; Protonmail has refused to protect the information the NSA wants, this is a concern.</p>
<p><strong>7. Swiss MLAT Law Could Give the NSA Full Access</strong></p>
<p>Protonmail’s Servers Reside In Switzerland, a country with an MLAT treaty that could allow the NSA to continue it’s the mission of recording “nearly everything” about a person’s internet communication.&nbsp; Any doubts the MLAT treaty applies are removed when you take into account that Protonmail is part-owned by FONGIT, a Swiss Government-financed company.&nbsp; Protonmail has also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/cwld9o/protonmail_changed_his_policy/eykbrqz/">recently revised</a> its <a href="https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> to include wording and requirements from the MLAT treaty.&nbsp; Their actions show they are capitulating with the MLAT treaty.&nbsp; Revisions include a change to their privacy policy allowing them to track your location while you use their service in some situations.</p>
<p><strong>8. Protonmail Uses Radware for DNS/DDOS Protection</strong></p>
<p>Privacy companies like Protonmail are required to use a DNS/DDOS service because of the frequent attacks against their service.&nbsp; Protonmail <a href="https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/protonmail-israel-radware/">uses a company called Radware</a> for this purpose.&nbsp; Radware is a low-quality service that has failed to provide adequate protection.&nbsp; Protonmail has been taken offline, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/protonmail-names-one-of-the-attackers-behind-a-major-ddos-this-summer/">sometimes by teenage kids,</a> because they insist on using a sub-par service.&nbsp; It’s worth noting that Radware’s international office is a few miles away from the headquarters of the most powerful Intelligence agency on earth, The Isreali Mossad.&nbsp; Radware can gain complete access to all Protonmail user’s accounts in two ways.&nbsp; They could inject a few lines of code that would reveal all users log in username and passwords, thus allowing them to log in as if they are that user.&nbsp; They could also be given users usernames &amp; passwords by Protonmail.&nbsp; Remember Protonmail has admitted they can access all user’s accounts and decrypt their data.&nbsp; Additionally, it has been reported that Radware has <a href="https://cryptome.org/2015/11/protonmail-ddos.htm">direct connections</a>&nbsp;to the Israeli Defense Force.</p>
<p><strong>9. Protonmail Developers Do Not Use Protonmail</strong></p>
<p>Protonmail’s developers are in a position to know the real security offered by Protonmail.&nbsp; &nbsp;And<a href="https://privacy-watchdog.io/protonmail-devs-do-not-use-protonmail/"> Protonmail’s developers do not use Protonmail</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you were served food by a cook who refused to eat the food, would that be a cause of concern to you?&nbsp; This is the same situation.&nbsp; Protonmail developers do not use Protonmail, there are likely good reasons for this.</p>
<p><strong>10. Protonmail engages in illegal cyberwarfare</strong></p>
<p>In 2017 Protonmail seems to have used illegal cyber warfare capabilities to unlawfully break into a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvvke7/email-provider-protonmail-says-it-hacked-back-then-walks-claim-back">suspects server.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; You can see the tweet they posted and read about it <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvvke7/email-provider-protonmail-says-it-hacked-back-then-walks-claim-back">here</a>. They soon deleted the tweet and said: “We cannot confirm nor deny if anything happened.”&nbsp; In 2013 the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-eu-cybercrime-idUSBRE9630LD20130704">European Union parliament voted</a> to make hacking a crime that carried a prison sentence of 2 years.&nbsp; “Hacking back” is also illegal under Swiss law.&nbsp; Based on Protonmail’s admissions only, they conducted an illegal hack.</p>
<p><strong>11. Protonmail has a history of Dishonesty.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://privacy-watchdog.io/protonmails-false-claims/">From Protonmail’s creation lied to their users</a>.&nbsp; Starting when they crowdfunded $550k to “remain Independent”, a promise they broke almost immediately by<a href="https://privacy-watchdog.io/protonmails-crowdfunding-equity-sale/"> selling equity ownership to a US corporation with ties to President Obama and John Podesta.</a></p>
<p>In our opinion Protonmail is not an email solution you would use if you want privacy or security.&nbsp; Your emails are probably going to end up in a US data center right next to your Gmail emails.</p>

Eg: <code>#medium</code>.</li><li id="d316">Send a message to that channel by issuing <code>PRIVMSG ${channel} Hello!</code></li><li id="7117">Since everything is text-based, messages destined to channel or directly to you are having <code>PRIVMSG</code> tag.</li><li id="80d9">You can <code>WHOIS</code> yourself like: <code>WHOIS ${nickname}</code></li></ol><h2 id="be09">Parsing incoming messages</h2><p id="d180">Incoming data relevant to our application structured as follows.</p><pre><span id="969a">:mert!~pvtmert@[redacted] PRIVMSG #channel :hello!<br>:mert!~pvtmert@[redacted] PRIVMSG mynickname :sup bro!</span></pre><p id="d757">I haven’t read the specification but <strong>fields are separated by a colon</strong> (<code>:</code>) character.

Then passing that name to <code>PRIVMSG</code> is a way to go.</p><p id="3d2b">For sending direct-messages, destination user is needed. Which is the <code>mert!~pvtmert@[redacted]</code> part. The problem here is this is a full <code>WHOIS</code> or identity, you just need <code>NICK</code> to send a reply back.<br>Given <code>{nick}!~{identity}@{hostname}</code> structure, taking parts between the colon (<code>:</code>) and exclamation mark (<code>!</code>) is enough to pass it to <code>PRIVMSG</code> command.</p><h2 id="57f7">Gluing <code>netcat</code> with <code>bash</code></h2><blockquote><p id="33d0">The <code>-e</code> or <code>-c</code> switches of netcat connects socket I/O with the application’s standard I/O.</p></blockquote><p id="957f">When you check the embedded help page of netcat via <code>netcat -h</code> /<code>netcat --help</code> or <code>nc -h</code> /<code>nc --help</code> (depending on your distribution and netcat version) there is switches generally named <code>-e</code> and <code>-c</code> which allows user to pass a program. <strong>The program’s input (aka </strong><code><strong>stdin</strong></code><strong>) will be connected to the socket’s output pipe, and the program’s output (aka </strong><code><strong>stdout</strong></code><strong>) will be connected to the socket’s input pipe.</strong> <em>Error output (aka </em><code><em>stderr</em></code><em>) will output to the regular console.</em></p><h2 id="c942">The initial “echoing parrot” script.</h2><p id="40f1">A basic bash script that <code>echo</code>‘es initial commands then filters <code>stdin</code> for incoming messages on joined channel, <code>$CHAN</code>.

<p>The first phase of GSoC concluded recently (I passed!) and I wanted to talk about the things I did so far and the process to this point.</p>

</ul>

<p>I got selected as a student for the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program. You can find my proposal at <a href="https://aadibajpai.com/gsoc/">https://aadibajpai.com/gsoc/</a>.  Since I go into detail in some places, reading the proposal once would make it easier to follow along as it provides important context. For phase 1, there were 3 major tracks: Logging x Notifications, Testing, and fixing a security flaw in the backend, along with a few minor tracks.</p>
<p>The initial application had gone by a bit fast, since I officially enrolled just a day before the application deadline. But well, I was able to apply successfully, got selected and here we are.</p>

<p>Being well acquainted with the org and my mentors already, I directly began to work through my proposal during this period. I cleaned up some of the issues and pull requests—although I am saving most of them for use in later stages. Then, I made new releases for <a href="https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify/commit/977a195fae66896dec865132256825c32bbfbfe8">SwagLyrics</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwSpotify/commit/1213be5ce630bdcfdb63ec368c260ca5c627de3a">SwSpotify</a>. The SwagLyrics Chrome Extension was also <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/swaglyrics-for-spotify/miopldoofdhmipepmnclnoangcdffmlk">published</a>! It adds support for the Spotify Web Player on SwagLyrics which was a long awaited feature.</p>
<p>More notably, I managed to complete an important major track in this time, there was a very weird unreproducible error occurring in swaglyrics that had been haunting us for a month or so. One day I stayed up, analyzed everything from the ground up and discovered that Genius had been A/B testing a new page format, which broke our parser whenever the new version was sent which was random and location dependent. Then, it was basically isolating the new html and parsing the new format. Now the worst part about this was that it wasn't anything we could handle in advance or even figure out, but I'm glad we caught it when we did if not sooner.</p>
<p>Most notable, however, was fixing a flaw in the backend which would have made my life way harder if discovered by someone else. The issue making feature of the backend does some verification checks to determine if the info is legit or not, e.g. if the song does actually exist on Spotify or not, along with some rate limiting. However, you could've spammed it with actual songs from Spotify for which it would work and it would have opened those spam issues. To fix this I just needed to ping the Genius webpage with the stripper crafted from the song, artist info received, but since this wasn't through an API, and PythonAnywhere doesn't allow non-API requests on the free tier, it was just sitting there unresolved.</p>
<p>However, since PythonAnywhere is awesome, after two very polite emails I was allowed access which fixed this for all eternity 🤗</p>

<h2 id="minor-tracks">Minor Tracks</h2>
<p>The first track was adding type hints. Now it's not like a super big project where it is absolutely needed but I feel they greatly improve readability. It also helped me find a <em>bug</em> where I thought I was passing an <code>int</code> but it was through an environment variable so it was actually a string, I mean it was getting handled automatically but the more you know. Additionally, I guess now I can integrate <code>mypy</code> into the CI itself, which should be useful in the long term. Earlier, the <code>typing</code> library used to add some overhead but that has been improved now, so it made sense to do it.</p>
<p>Then, it was about adding support for Bollywood songs. Through empirical evidence which totally wasn't the 9838731 GitHub issues that swaglyrics opens, we discovered a lot of Bollywood songs on Spotify include the movie name in the title which sometimes did not resolve very well.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/V08NyAy.png" alt="GitHub Issues"></p>
<p>As you can see, it is always preceded by From and enclosed within "" which we can handle by modifying a previous regex to:</p>
<p><code>brc = re.compile(r'([(\[](feat|ft|From "[^"]*")[^)\]]*[)\]]|- .*)', re.I)</code></p>
<p>and it was taken care of.</p>
<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
<p>This is exactly what it sounds like, adding proper logging to the swaglyrics backend. So far I was making do with print statements, which is actually a fantastic way of logging but I was missing out on context—since all the print output just gets clumped together. With the python <code>logging</code> library, there's more fine-grained control over the logs than plain print statements. For example, you might not want to log loops and stuff in production since that would spam logs, but that information would be crucial when debugging. So now I can simply set the log level to <code>debug</code> on staging and <code>info</code> on production. This was also cool because while implementing this across functions I managed to refactor a few of them to be more readable and pythonic.</p>
<p>The only qualm for me was that PythonAnywhere has this "feature" of mirroring the server and error logs if the logging library is used so you don't miss anything even if your config is misconfigured. As in, all logs output will be present in both those log file. To be honest that is a minor grievance for me but well (who checks logs really, but more on this in the next segment).</p>
<p>Additionally, I now have a valuable code snippet addition: a decorator to log the arguments passed to a function. You can even supply an argument to truncate arguments if they're longer than <code>x</code> characters to keep your logs clean and spiffy. Since this might be something useful to other projects as well, you can grab the code <a href="https://github.com/SwagLyrics/swaglyrics-backend/blob/master/swaglyrics_backend/utils.py#L86-L122">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>
<p>I really don't grasp logging. Like, every time I want to look at something or view them when an error happens, I need to open browser → PythonAnywhere → Web tab → logging file → filter through to whatever I am looking for. Sounds good, doesn't work (very well). I would very much prefer for logs to come to me, rather than me going to them if that makes sense. Also, there's no way to see it as it happens when you're logging to a file or separate different requests in chunks so you can focus on one request being processed at a time instead of all of them in succession one after the other. All of this pales in comparison to the biggest problem I have with raw logs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>raw 💀🎺 logs 💀🎺 look 💀🎺 trash</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously, it's just a huge wall of text and I'm supposed to somehow find the parts I'm looking for, can't it just you know, be a bit visually appealing so I don't want to just nope out right after opening them.</p>
<p>/endrant lol</p>
<p>Overall, I guess this is the reason why there's so many ✨shiny✨ dashboards and log processors but that would be overkill for my use case. We were already using Discord webhook magic to log requests to the Discord bot as well as successful backend deploy activity, so that's what I went with for the logs that were important to me: stripper resolution, and instrumentalness check.</p>
<p>Before the backend creates an issue, it checks whether the song is instrumental or not. If it is instrumental then it would not have lyrics and hence, no issue creation is necessary. Now we get the instrumentalness and speechiness values from Spotify but the thresholds for deciding if it is instrumental or not are custom. So it is important to view the logs of these as they happen to identify false positives and negatives to fine tune the values even more and potentially use this when serving lyrics as well. Earlier, this would have meant me periodically checking all the values and the artist names which to be frank I never did. But now it just comes in like-</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eo7Am8b.png" alt="InstrumentalnessBoi">
  	<figcaption>way more beautiful &lt;3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now it's trivial to eyeball cases right from the embed—we know Für Elise is obviously instrumental. If it was flagging it as not instrumental, then I'd have known the values were wack in one look instead of specifically hunting for this in raw logs and then comparing the confidence scores. In fact, the screenshot above is <em>after</em> <a href="https://github.com/SwagLyrics/swaglyrics-backend/commit/4624ebe3bd952f5c9fc6cf3d8756567e5329adbb">fine-tuning the thresholds</a> a while ago based on the feedback off of InstrumentalnessBoi.</p>
<p>Similarly, there's GeniusStripperBoi which helps to identify patterns where the song name mismatches on Genius and Spotify and really only needs a look to figure out if it's being caused by us or simply because the lyrics aren't available on Genius.</p>
<p>Really, I'm very happy with how well these two turned out. Since we were using Discord for development anyway, this integrates very well and will be quite useful to ease development in the next phases!</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p><em>Unittests... my old friend.</em></p>
<p>If you thought the last segment was a rant then, boy, were you wrong. I'm actually kidding, I like unittests and the value they provide. It is very nice to be working when you have <em>some</em> confidence that the code will be tested for regressions—has definitely saved me a few times. What I don't like, however, is writing them.</p>
<p>This was primarily about testing the swaglyrics backend, it had some tests written during GCI 2019 but the vast majority of routes and functions were untested. An annoying thing here was that while the test runner used was <code>pytest</code>, in order to preserve compatibility the tests themselves had been written with <code>unittest</code>. It didn't seem as much of a deal when I started writing them, but it meant I wasn't able to use pytest fixtures which would have made some parts easier.</p>
<p>I grinded unittests hard for like a week, refactored a lot of old ones and wrote ~40 new ones. The coverage now sits at a nice 80% and there's basically this large decorator that checks if a request is from github that is untested-not exactly critical. I feel I'll ultimately end up testing it as well just to get that sweet 100% coverage badge.</p>
<p>The reason it took so much time for writing tests is that you want to write smart tests, instead of just tests that hit the code once. I'd typically think of the logical flow as it goes and then try to write tests that mimic it, so now if there's a deviation from it then we'd know—which wouldn't happen if it was just executing the lines once to increasing coverage. Plus, since there's functions and flask routes and loggers and a really specific db query <em>shudders</em>, testing each of them …</p></div></div></div>

<p>In the last two months, I read <em>Pale Rider</em> by Laura Spinney to better understand how people reacted to the Spanish Flu. The book did a great job of using many local stories to capture a full global picture of the pandemic. I learned how much hasn't changed, and how most of the behavior we are seeing today is nothing new. Since then, I've spent a good part of the past month thinking about the relationship Americans have with the virus. We know that we should socially distance ourselves to curb the spread of the virus, but we're not doing so. Regulation is now a major topic as anti-mask &amp; anti-lockdown protesters continue to fight against mandatory mask and social distancing rules set by the government and corporations. According to an <a href="https://www.notion.so/tolusnotes/Contact-Tracing-and-Technology-e50bccfb83f646a6aae04d030a1906e9#7872026c8f814c5ab1037136df2be8cb">NBC / WSJ poll</a>, fifty-eight percent of registered voters didn't want lockdown restrictions lifted while thirty-two percent were more concerned about the economy. Yet, states slowly reopened. The rate at which the virus was spreading stagnated in May before spiking again in early June. States are now going &nbsp;under lockdown again. This ordeal reminded me of a passage I read in <em>The Undoing Project </em>by Michael Lewis.</p><blockquote>Redelmeier was newly struck by the inability of human beings to judge risks, even when their misjudgment might kill them. When making judgments, people obviously could use help—say, by requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets. Later Redelmeier said as much to one of his fellow students, an American. What is it with you freedom-loving Americans? he asked. Live free or die. I don’t get it. I say, “Regulate me gently. I’d rather live.”</blockquote><p>Yes, some Americans have chosen to risk death over regulation. Choosing to risk death is a choice they have made not only for themselves, but by also for people around them.</p><h3 id="regulate-me-not">Regulate me not</h3><p>When people choose not to stay apart or wear masks, the least they can do is to let people they have interacted with know if they are feeling symptoms or if they have tested positive for the virus. This way, communities can curb the spread of the virus by self-quarantining. This is one of the first steps in contact tracing, and it is much difficult in practice. When a person is feeling symptoms, they can get tested for the virus. If the test is positive, they get a call from a health official that asks a series of health-related questions. The questions are meant to trace who and where they might have spread the disease to. People can expect to divulge sensitive information such as the names and contact information of those individuals so the health official can notify them also. As it stands, the process is taxing on both parties. There are sample scripts and guidelines online that show how the patient is placed in a very vulnerable position. The health official, on the other hand, has to deal with varying emotions over many of these conversations. This process is extremely inefficient. This is where technology, in the form of contact tracing apps, comes into play. An Oxford research showed that <a href="https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2020-04-16-digital-contact-tracing-can-slow-or-even-stop-coronavirus-transmission-and-ease-us-out-of-lockdown" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact tracing apps can slow or even stop transmission</a> depending on adoption. Unlike humans, the technology required is infinitely scalable and can work around the clock to notify people of exposure before they infect others. They estimate that the app could lower the notification delay from <a href="https://www.coronavirus-fraser-group.org/mobile-app" rel="noopener noreferrer">72 hours down to 4 hours</a>. Good thing the U.S. is a tech powerhouse, right?</p><figure><img src="https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/2020/07/app-contact-tracing.png" alt="" srcset="https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/app-contact-tracing.png 600w, https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/app-contact-tracing.png 1000w, https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/size/w1264/2020/07/app-contact-tracing.png 1264w"><figcaption>Fraser Group, Oxford University’s Big Data Institute</figcaption></figure><p>So far, attempts at using technology to make contact tracing more efficient in the <a href="https://www.axios.com/contact-tracing-apps-coronavirus-adoption-us-aa63a3fd-7508-4d6f-bd7e-f4d144b6d92e.html">U.S has been slow</a>. It's kind of disappointing, really. Privacy seems to be the reason behind the lack of adoption. These apps need to track where users go, and who they came in contact with. On top of that, the data may be linked to sensitive health records like diagnosis and visits. States are the main entities, if any, pushing these apps to support health officials. But not enough users <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/29/most-americans-are-not-willing-or-able-use-an-app-tracking-coronavirus-infections-thats-problem-big-techs-plan-slow-pandemic/">trust them to keep their data safe</a>. This doubt is warranted because healthcare institutions aren't known for their data security. According to Protenus, over forty-one million patient records were exposed in hundreds of breaches in 2019 alone. A <a href="https://www.protenus.com/resources/2020-breach-barometer/">forty-eight percent increase in the number of incidents</a>. This is not a good sign because health-tech solutions are needed now more than ever in the history of the field.</p><h3 id="digital-contact-tracing-in-the-united-states">Digital Contact Tracing in the United States</h3><p>Choosing to give existing contact tracing apps the benefit of the doubt, I decided to see what the options were. "After all", I thought, "government-backed efforts have to be above average". To do this, I searched for "Contact Tracing" on July 11, 2020, in both major app stores. In total, I found 6 apps that claim to be affiliated with U.S. state or local governments.</p><p>The first issue I noticed was around discoverability. Of the six apps, four were available on Android, and all six were available on IOS. But when I searched for "Contact Tracing," only two of four results are returned in the play store, and five of the six in the app store.</p><p>From the app descriptions, it <em>seemed</em> like five states had official apps with some backing multiple states. But like anyone unwilling to trust app store descriptions, I inversed the search to see if state governments were promoting these apps on their .gov pages. <strong>Contact Tracing</strong> (the app) claims Daly City, but I couldn't find any mention of it on official government pages even though WSJ claimed they were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-google-and-apple-stores-had-a-covid-19-app-with-ads-11591365499">working together</a>. &nbsp;<strong>Citizen SafeTrace</strong>, the same company behind the social safety app, claims San Joaquin County, CA, but not the other way around. <a href="https://coronavirus.utah.gov/healthy-together-app/">Utah</a> claims <strong>Healthy Together</strong>; they <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/22/utah-launches-an-app/">paid $2.75M</a> for it. <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/care19-app-now-available-android-users">North</a> and <a href="https://covid.sd.gov/care19app.aspx">South Dakota</a> along with <a href="https://covid19.wyo.gov/care19-app">Wyoming</a> claim <strong>Care19 Diary</strong>, and <a href="https://www.tetoncountywy.gov/2156/PathCheck-SafePlaces-Mobile-App">Teton County, Wyoming</a> claims <strong>PathCheck SafePlaces</strong>. Finally, <a href="https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/">Rhode Island</a> claims <strong>CRUSH COVID RI</strong>. Google and Apple can prevent bad actors from releasing malicious apps, but it is ultimately up to local governments to prove the credibility of their apps.</p><h3 id="location-tracking-is-not-popular">Location tracking is not popular</h3><p>Though almost all six of the apps made privacy and security promises, Healthy Together caught my eye because actual government effort went into it in the form of taxpayer dollars. Here's a quote from their <a href="https://www.notion.so/tolusnotes/Contact-Tracing-and-Technology-e50bccfb83f646a6aae04d030a1906e9#ed813780b2b84aac991d1151560fc504">website</a>:</p><blockquote>We will retain personally identifiable health-related information that you share with us no longer than 30 days after you provide it, except when applicable legal requirements mandate a longer retention period. After 30 days, we will retain, use and share limited, de-identified health-related information only for COVID-19 response efforts or other public health or research purposes.</blockquote><p>While most apps are struggling to gain adoption with solutions that anonymize data by default, Healthy Together doesn't try. In the event of a data breach, personal data can be traced back to a user within the first thirty days since that data was collected. We can assume that the data will live with them forever after those thirty days as long as the account remains active. It's important to note that thirty days is more than enough time for hackers to breach and potentially decrypt that data. Furthermore, keeping the data linked to users is not a good way to signal trust especially when that data is health related. This particular solution is not great. It led me to wonder why Utah paid over $2.7 million to a <a href="https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?filing=&amp;SearchType=NUMBER&amp;SearchCriteria=202011510551" rel="noopener noreferrer">7-day old company</a>. The app <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/utahs-275-million-contact-tracing-app-few-downloads-report-2020-5" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed to gain adoption</a>, and <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/07/11/states-m-healthy-together/" rel="noopener noreferrer">no longer traces contacts</a> because they learned that "location tracking isn’t popular". This scenario captures the current state of contact tracing tech solutions in the U.S.</p><figure><img src="https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/2020/07/gaen.png" alt="" srcset="https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/gaen.png 600w, https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/size/w851/2020/07/gaen.png 851w"></figure><p>With privacy in mind, Google and Apple created a <a href="https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing" rel="noopener noreferrer">solution</a> that doesn't use GPS. Similar to some of the solutions above, Exposure Notification (EN) uses Bluetooth to approximate the distance between your phone and other broadcasting phones. But unlike most of the other apps, they've disconnected themselves from the data. EN is not an actual app. It is a framework that other developers can leverage in their apps. The API will work to generate unique keys and keep them anonymous as they bounce between phones. If an individual tests positive, they can choose to upload the keys they generated in the past two weeks. People will get alerted if their phone downloads a key belonging to someone that has tested positive.</p><p>Privacy-wise, the solution works. First, people have to opt in to enable the feature even though most devices should already be capable of EN. The unique keys are stored locally on each device ensuring control over the anonymous keys. People that test positive have to consent, again, to upload the last 14 days of their unique keys. At this stage, those keys are still useless as they should not be linked to any individual phone. Potential exposures are only surfaced after phones download and match the new list of keys that belong to anonymous users that have tested positive. An app based on this solution will check the privacy box. It is anonymous, private by design, and can only be used by apps created by health officials. The only issue would be if servers unintentionally log IP addresses or device information. But by limiting who can use EN, Google and Apple should be auditing the servers that end up with the list of keys. Their <a href="https://covid19-static.cdn-apple.com/applications/covid19/current/static/contact-tracing/pdf/ExposureNotification-CryptographySpecificationv1.2.pdf?1" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptography specification</a> notes that:</p><blockquote>The server must not retain metadata from clients uploading Diagnosis Keys after including those key in the aggregated list of Diagnosis Keys per day.</blockquote><p>An app would check the privacy box, but there aren't many apps using the API. As of writing, none of the six apps mentioned used EN.

<p>A question I get asked frequently is, “How did you learn cryptography?”</p>



<p>I could certainly tell everyone my history as a self-taught programmer who discovered cryptography when, after my website for my indie game projects kept getting hacked, I was introduced to cryptographic hash functions… but I suspect the question folks want answered is, “How would you recommend I learn cryptography?” rather than my cautionary tale about poorly-implemented password hash being a gateway bug.</p>



<h2>The Traditional Ways to Learn</h2>



<p>There are two traditional ways to learn cryptography.</p>



<p>If you want a book to augment your journey in either traditional path, I recommend <a href="https://nostarch.com/seriouscrypto"><em>Serious Cryptography</em></a> by Jean-Philippe Aumasson.</p>



<h3>Academic Cryptography</h3>



<p>The traditional academic way to learn cryptography involves a lot of self-study about number theory, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, probability, permutations, and field theory.</p>



<p>You’d typically start off with classical ciphers (Caesar, etc.) then work your way through the history of ciphers until you finally reach an introduction to the math underpinning RSA and Diffie-Hellman, and maybe taught about Schneier’s Law and cautioned to only use AES and SHA-2… and then you’re left to your own devices unless you pursue a degree in cryptography.</p>



<p>The end result of people carelessly exploring this path is a lot of designs like Telegram’s MTProto that do stupid things with exotic block cipher modes and misusing vanilla cryptographic hash functions as message authentication codes; often with textbook a.k.a. unpadded RSA, AES in ECB, CBC, or some rarely-used mode that the author had to write custom code to handle (using ECB mode under the hood), and (until recently) SHA-1.</p>



<p>People who decide to pursue cryptography as a serious academic discipline will not make these mistakes. They’re far too apt for the common mistakes. Instead, they run the risk of spending years involved in esoteric research about homomorphic encryption, cryptographic pairings, and other cool stuff that might not see real world deployment (outside of novel cryptocurrency hobby projects) for five or more years.</p>



<p>That is to say: Academia is a valid path to pursue, but it’s not for everyone.</p>



<p>If you want to explore this path, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto">Cryptography I</a> by Dan Boneh is a great starting point.</p>



<h3>Security Industry-Driven Cryptography</h3>



<p>The other traditional way to learn cryptography is to break existing cryptography implementations. This isn’t always as difficult as it may sound: Reverse engineering video games to defeat anti-cheat protections has led several of my friends into learning about cryptography.</p>



<p>For security-minded folks, the best place to start is the <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">CryptoPals</a> challenges. Another alternative is <a href="https://cryptohack.org/">CryptoHack</a>. </p>



<p>There are also plenty of CTF events all year around, but they’re rarely a good cryptography learning exercise above what CryptoPals offers. (Though there are <a href="https://medium.com/ledger-on-security-and-blockchain/ledger-donjon-wins-kudelski-crypto-challenge-behind-the-scene-1-3-c6e45d3f3dad">notable exceptions</a>.)</p>



<h2>A Practical Approach to Learning Cryptography</h2>







<p>If you’re coming from a computer programming background and want to learn cryptography, the traditional approaches carry the risk of <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/121201011592/reasoning-by-lego-the-wrong-way-to-think-about">Reasoning By Lego</a>.</p>



<p>Instead, the approach I recommend is to start gaining experience with the safest, highest-level libraries and then slowly working your way down into the details.</p>



<p>This approach has two benefits:</p>



<ol><li>If you have to implement something while you’re still learning, your knowledge and experience is stilted towards “use something safe and secure” not “hack together something with Blowfish in ECB mode and MD5 because they’re familiar”.</li><li>You can let your own curiosity guide your education rather than follow someone else’s study guide.</li></ol>



<p>To illustrate what this looks like, here’s how a JavaScript developer might approach learning cryptography, starting from the most easy-mode library and drilling down into specifics.</p>



<h3>Super Easy Mode: DholeCrypto</h3>



<p>Disclaimer: This is my project.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a></strong> is an open source library, implemented in JavaScript and PHP and powered by libsodium, that tries to make security as easy as possible.</p>



<p>I designed Dhole Crypto for securing my own projects without increasing the cognitive load of anyone reviewing my code.</p>



<p>If you’re an experienced programmer, you should be able to successfully use Dhole Crypto in a Node.js/PHP project. If it does not come easy, that is a bug that should be fixed immediately.</p>



<h3>Easy Mode: Libsodium</h3>



<p>Using <strong><a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">libsodium</a></strong> is slightly more involved than Dhole Crypto: Now you have to know what a nonce is, and take care to manage them carefully.</p>



<p>Advantage: Your code will be faster than if you used Dhole Crypto.</p>



<p>Libsodium is still pretty easy. If you use this <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/06/libsodium-quick-reference-quick-comparison-similar-functions-and-which-one-use">cheat sheet</a>, you can implement something secure without much effort. If you deviate from the cheat sheet, pay careful attention to the documentation.</p>



<p>If you’re writing system software (i.e. programming in C), libsodium is an incredibly easy-to-use library.</p>



<h3>Moderate Difficulty: Implementing Protocols</h3>



<p>Let’s say you’re working on a project where libsodium is overkill, and you only need a few cryptography primitives and constructions (e.g. XChaCha20-Poly1305). A good example: In-browser JavaScript.</p>



<p>Instead of forcing your users to download the entire Sodium library, you might opt to implement a compatible construction using JavaScript implementations of these primitives.</p>



<p>Since you have trusted implementations to test your construction against, this should be a comparatively low-risk effort (assuming the primitive implementations are also secure), but it’s not one that should be undertaken without all of the prior experience.</p>



<p>Note: At this stage you are not implementing the primitives, just using them.</p>



<h3>Hard Difficulty: Designing Protocols and Constructions</h3>

<p>To distinguish: TLS and Noise are protocols. AES-GCM and XChaCha20-Poly1305 are constructions.</p>



<p>Once you’ve implemented protocols and constructions, the next step in your self-education is to design new ones.</p>



<p>Maybe you want to combine XChaCha20 with a MAC based on the BLAKE3 hash function, with some sort of SIV to make the whole shebang nonce-misuse resistant?</p>



<p>You wouldn’t want to dive headfirst into cryptography protocol/construction design without all of the prior experience.</p>



<h3>Very Hard Mode: Implementing Cryptographic Primitives</h3>



<p>It’s not so much that cryptography primitives are hard to implement. You could fit RC4 in a tweet before they raised the character limit to 280. (Don’t use RC4 though!)</p>



<p>The hard part is that they’re hard to implement securely. See also: <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/26/learning-from-ladderleak-is-ecdsa-broken/">LadderLeak</a>.</p>



<p>Usually when you get to this stage in your education, you will have also picked up one or both of the traditional paths to augment your understanding. If not, you really <em>should</em>.</p>



<h3>Nightmare Mode: Designing Cryptography Primitives</h3>



<p>A lot of people like to dive straight into this stage early in their education. This usually <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">ends in tears</a>.</p>



<p>If you’ve mastered every step in my prescribed outline and pursued both of the traditional paths to the point that you have a novel published attack in a peer-reviewed journal (and mirrored on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/">ePrint</a>), then you’re probably ready for this stage.</p>



<hr>



<p>Bonus: If you’re a furry and you become a cryptography expert, you can call yourself a <strong>cryptografur.</strong> If you had no other reason to learn cryptography, do it just for pun!</p>

<h2>The Rule of Least Power</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html">1998</a>, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, coined <em>the Principle of Least Power</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer Science in the 1960s to 80s spent a lot of effort making languages which were as powerful as possible. Nowadays we have to appreciate the reasons for picking not the most powerful solution but the least powerful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">2006</a>, The W3C codified the principle as the <em>Rule of Least Power</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an important tradeoff between the computational power of a language and the ability to determine what a program in that language is doing</p>
<p>Expressing constraints, relationships and processing instructions in less powerful languages increases the flexibility with which information can be reused: the less powerful the language, the more you can do with the data stored in that language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, Berners-Lee chose not to make HTML a bona-fide language on the basis of this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose HTML not to be a programming language because I wanted different programs to do different things with it: present it differently, extract tables of contents, index it, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the Rule of Least Power targeted programming languages themselves, rather than language features, I think the same ideas still apply. The less powerful your code is, the easier it is to reason about.</p>
<h2>Array Functions</h2>
<p>It's therefore interesting that <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-loops-map-filter-reduce-find/">some</a> people say say that the 'functional' array functions like <code>.filter</code>, <code>.map</code>, and <code>.reduce</code> are <em>powerful</em> compared to their crude for-loop alternatives. I would say the opposite: they are far less powerful, and that's the <em>point</em>.</p>
<p>No doubt, the people calling these functions 'powerful' are probably referring to their power in aggregate (for example being able to call <code>array.map(...).filter(...)</code>), or the power enabled through parallel processing, or the power afforded by assigning callbacks to first-class function variables.</p>
<p>But I want to bring your attention to how the power of these functions when considered individually is in fact low, by design.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram I whipped up that crudely orders the common javascript array functions, going from the most powerful (a for-loop) to the least powerful (<code>.some</code>/<code>.every</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EvOGL7B.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Array Function Recap</h3>
<p>Before explaining what I mean by powerful, here's a quick recap of what the different approaches are actually for:</p>
<ul>
<li>for-loop: iterate through a chunk of code, typically for the sake of creating side effects inside the loop (like appending to an array)</li>
<li><code>.forEach</code>: iterate through each element in an array, and in each iteration do something with that element. Again, typically for the sake of creating a side effect at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>From here down, side effects are strongly discouraged</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.reduce</code>: from left-to-right, iterate through an array to accumulate some value, potentially initialized explicitly at the start, where in each iteration we take the current array item and return the new value of the accumulator (until we return the final value at the end)</li>
<li><code>.map</code>: for each original item in the array, return a new item as a function of the original item to be placed in the corresponding index of the output array</li>
<li><code>.filter</code>: from left-to-right, for each item in the array, include it in the output array if it satisfies some condition</li>
<li><code>.find</code>: from left-to-right, return the first item in the array satisfying some condition</li>
<li><code>.every</code>: return true if every item in the array satisfies some condition, otherwise return false.</li>
<li><code>.some</code>: return true if any item in the array satisfies some condition, otherwise return false.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This post is less about explaining what each one does and more about picking which one to use. For a good reference see <a href="https://javascript.info/array-methods">here</a></em></p>
<h3>What Do You Mean By Powerful?</h3>
<p>I'm piggybacking off Tim Berners-Lee's coinage here, but when I say 'powerful', I really mean 'flexible'. As in, <em>how many use cases can this function satisfy?</em> Specifically, I'm defining function A as being more powerful than function B if it can implement function B in its own terms, and do other stuff too that function B can't.*</p>
<p>Which means by my definition (which I'm not claiming to be universal) a for-loop is more powerful than <code>.forEach</code> because you can implement <code>.forEach</code> via a for-loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>const forEach = (array, callback) =&gt; {
  for (i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    callback(array[i])
  }
}

forEach([1,2,3], a =&gt; console.log(a))
&gt; 1
&gt; 2
&gt; 3

[1,2,3].forEach(a =&gt; console.log(a))
&gt; 1
&gt; 2
&gt; 3</code></pre>
<p>So no matter what <code>.forEach</code> can do, a for-loop can do more.</p>
<p>Likewise, <code>.reduce</code> can be implemented with <code>.forEach</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>const reduce = (array, callback, initialValue) =&gt; {
  let result = initialValue

  array.forEach((item) =&gt; {
    result = callback(result, item)
  })

  return result
}

reduce([1,2,3], (acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr, 0)
&gt; 6

[1,2,3].reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr, 0)
&gt; 6</code></pre>
<p>And so on, and so on, all the way to the bottom:</p>
<pre><code>const some = (array, callback) =&gt; array.find(callback) !== undefined</code></pre>
<p>Notably, our custom <code>some</code> doesn't handle undefined values as well as the ECMASCript one, but you get the idea.</p>
<h3>Choose the Least Powerful Function</h3>
<p>Why not just use a for-loop for everything? That way we only need to remember one approach to iterating through an array's items. The reason is the same reason you don't use a grenade to kill a mosquito: grenades are illegal and black market goods are marked up to subsidise the risk taken on by the vendor.</p>
<p>For real though: there are various reasons to pick the least powerful tool, but to me the two most important reasons are:<br>
1) reducing the chance of errors<br>
2) easy comprehension by others</p>
<h4>Reducing the chance of errors</h4>
<p>The least powerful tool for the job that can <em>still do the job</em> is the one that leaves the least chance for errors. Consider the situation where I have an array of numbers and I want to return the result of doubling each item in the array:</p>
<pre><code>const myArray = [1,2,3]

// with `.map`
resultWithMap = myArray.map(item =&gt; item * 2)
&gt; [2,4,6]

// with a for-loop
let resultWithLoop = []
for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length-1; i++) {
  resultWithLoop.push(array[i] * 2)
}
resultWithLoop
&gt; [2,4]</code></pre>
<p>Hey, what the hell? Why is my <code>resultWithLoop</code> missing an item? I started my index at zero, I only incremented one at a time, and I'm ensuring I don't have an out of bounds error by ensuring I don't include the element at index <code>myArray.length</code>.</p>
<p>Oh wait, that <code>&lt;</code> in my for-loop should be a <code>&lt;=</code> (or I could remove the <code>-1</code> from <code>myArray.length-1</code>). My mistake.</p>
<p>The for-loop is too powerful to care about what you're actually using it for. Maybe you actually did want to exclude the final element, how could it know?  Luckily we caught this one early, but whether you're missing an <code>=</code> or missing a grenade pin, sometimes by the time you realise your mistake, it's already too late.</p>
<p>The reason <code>.map</code> is the appropriate choice here is because it is an abstraction that hides the control flow of looping through each item in a list, meaning it's impossible for you to get it wrong. When you use <code>.map</code>, you are guaranteed that the result will have as many elements as the original map, and that each element in the output array is a function only of the corresponding element in the input array**.</p>
<h4>Easy comprehension by others</h4>
<p>comparing the for-loop approach and the <code>.map</code> approach above, which is easier to parse as a reader? If you're only familiar with for-loops, you'll pick that, but given the ubiquity of <code>.map</code> in programming languages today, it's probably time to learn it. For those familiar with both, the <code>.map</code> approach is far easier to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't need to read through how the <code>i</code> variable is manipulated in the for-loop, because that's abstracted away.</li>
<li>You know what the shape of the output will be.</li>
<li>You don't need to worry about whether your original variable is being mutated in each iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without even looking at the callback function passed to <code>.map</code> you know a great deal about what to expect from the result. The same cannot be said of the for-loop.</p>
<p>Likewise, say I have an array of fruits and I want to know if it contains any apples. Here's a few approaches:</p>
<pre><code>const fruits = ['orange', 'pear', 'apple', 'apple', 'peach']

const hasAppleViaFilter = fruits.filter(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple').length &gt; 0
&gt; true

const hasAppleViaFind = fruits.find(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple') !== undefined
&gt; true

const hasAppleViaSome = fruits.some(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple')
&gt; true</code></pre>
<p>Each approach is ordered by decreasing power. Notice that <code>.some</code> is the easiest on the eyes? As soon as you see <code>.some</code> you know that <code>hasAppleViaSome</code> will be assigned a boolean value, based on the callback <code>fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple'</code>. In the filter approach, you need to mentally store the fact that we're creating an array with a subset of the original array's fruits, and then we're checking the length of it, and comparing with zero. Only once you parse all of that do you realise the actual implicit intention, which happens to be the same as the <em>explicit</em> intention of the <code>.some</code> method.</p>
<p>These are just small examples, but when you have a big hairy callback with heaps of code inside, the reader can see that it's still just a call to <code>.some</code> and can rest assured that all the callback will do is return true or false. This calibrates the expectations of the reader and makes it easier to process what <em>is</em> happening inside the callback.</p>
<pre><code>const hasAppleViaContrivedSome = fruits.some(fruit =&gt; {
  if (typeof fruit !== 'string') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'pear') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'orange') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'forbidden fruit') {
    return false
  }

  if (fruit.substring(1, 4) === 'pple') {
    return fruit === 'apple'
  }

  return false
})</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, when somebody comes across your code and sees a powerful function used to perform something as trivial as a <code>.some</code> call, they're going to be more confused than the time they stumbled upon a grenade in the place you usually keep the fly swatter.</p>

<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> is a Zilog Z80 netlist-level simulator capable of running Z80 machine code and also an educational tool with features that help reverse engineer and understand this chip better.</p>
<p>Z80 Explorer is a tool I wished I had a few years ago when I first started looking at the photos of Z80 chip die and was learning to reverse-engineer its <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/anatomy-z80-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a>. The process was slow and painful as it involved deciphering the faint image traces into logic gates and functions.</p>
<p>Sometimes later, I’ve found that the Visual6502 team have done a wonderful work with mapping the cpu’s traces into bitmaps representing various layers. Their online viewing <a href="http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/expert-z80.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tool </a>is impressive and one can learn a lot from using it, but as most online tools, it has limitations which I quickly hit when trying to understand the chip behavior in more depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I kept playing with the online tool, my wish list of additional features steadily grew. I would have wanted it not only to be a fully functional and a fast simulator but also to provide more elaborate ways to gain deeper insights into the chip's internal behavior, while also being educational, easy, and intuitive to use.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and with the help of repeated COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, I have written this tool to be the way I originally imagined it.</p>
<figure><a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-app.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-app.png" alt=""></a><figcaption>Z80 Explorer (click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this blog, I will give an overview of <em>Z80 Explorer</em>'s capabilities and show a couple of useful features which might be easy to miss even after reading the documentation. This blog may change periodically along with the tool itself as I am actively developing it at the moment (Summer 2020).</p>
<p>The tool's user’s guide is a separate online document located here <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/Z80ExplorerGuide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://baltazarstudios.com/Z80ExplorerGuide</a> It is very concise; if something is still unclear, please email me and I will expand on it.</p>
<p>The tool is written to load and use the Z80 dataset (layer images and netlist). It should be able to accommodate other NMOS chips with minimal changes. However, at this time I haven't done any other ports yet as I was solely focused on Z80. The chip's data (resources) are kept separate from the application and can be independently downloaded and updated from a shared <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/gdevic/Z80Explorer_Z80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github repo</a>. In particular, as the functions of various nets is understood and nets and buses get named, the list of the net names, tips and annotations can grow and be shared.</p>
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> is capable of running native Z80 code at the netlist level. That means, as the instruction opcodes are fed to its pins, the binary 1s and 0s propagate through its internal nets of transistor gates and perform the function identical to what the silicon gates would do on a real chip.</p>
<p>The engine that runs it is quite fast: On my 4GHz i7-4790K CPU, I am able to run Z80 code at around 2.3kHz which is (only!) around 2000 times slower from the speed it would have run on the real silicon. At those “speeds”, it is not inconceivable to run some of the standard CPU diagnostic programs - so I did just that: I run a well known ZEXALL diagnostic program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That program normally takes hours even on a real Z80. </p>
<p>After a few days of running within the simulator, the list of passing tests kept growing. At one point, after a week or so, the simulator’s internal cycle counter overflowed its 32-bit variable and the simulation stopped. I simply had to resume it, with no need to reset it and with no loss to the accumulated progress.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-zexall.png" alt=""><figcaption>Z80 Explorer running ZEXALL diagnostic</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>I have added that version of ZEXALL to the app resources. It is modified from the original in that I had sorted the tests by how long they run: with the quickest going first, it does not take too long before you start seeing some results, assuring you that it is indeed running well.</p>
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> has "Image views" where it shows various versions of chip images. Some of them are unmodified resource files shown as layers (diffusion, metal layer etc.), and some are created as combinations of those: vss.vcc.nets.col is a layer with the nets colored such that ground is shown as green, vcc red, and the rest of the nets are colored according to user filters.</p>
<p>You can view different layers and create combinations of them if you hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on layer buttons, or press a key assigned to each layer while holding down the Ctrl key.</p>
<p>The chip/layer view can also be annotated. The application loads a default annotation file (containing those annotations) when it starts, but you can load any other annotation file by dragging that file and dropping it into the application image view. For example, “annot_internals.json” (located in the resource folder) contains a different set of annotations focused more on the internal features. Annotations are adaptive so that they will show and hide as you zoom in and out. They also can contain "macros", which are tokens that expand into named net's and bus' values, and those are updated in real time, as the simulation runs.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Dynamic annotations showing U and V bus values (~ means "inverted")</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In my older article <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/z80-instruction-register-deciphered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> I looked at the Instruction Register. The signal that enables loading it is a complementary WE (Write Enable) pair of control traces.</p>
<p>Can we find exactly at what time(s) the write enable, now called, "load_ir", is asserted? What is the internal logic equation that governs this control signal?</p>
<p>Using the <em>Z80 Explorer</em>'s "Find" option to search for "load_ir" signal name, and then asking for the schematic of that net, brings up this view:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Schematic view for "load_ir" net</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Hence, the signal is generated by OR'ing net 255 with a latch. Let's follow net 255 which is a NAND gate of clock (hence, a clock gating) with the net 1329. Selecting (double-clicking on) 1329 and asking for the schematic brings us even closer to what we expected to see:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1329.png" alt=""><figcaption>Schematic view for net 1329</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Therefore, the net 1329 is a clock-gated, NAND-combined signal, active when M3, T3 and PLA22 are active. PLA22 represents "IX/IY+CB" instruction extension decode. (The description of PLA22 is held in the application "tips" file as are descriptions of all other PLA entries and some other important nets).</p>
<p>Back to the latch 244 - and this part may not too obvious unless you have some experience looking at the chip traces - the net 244 is at the bottom and the latch set and reset signals are at the top, both clock-gated:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-244.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch at the net 244</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Asking for the schematic of the net 1306 (the one connected from the top-left), which also acts as the latch reset:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1306.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch 244 reset</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>we see that the latch will reset on the "internal reset" or a T3 cycle. The latch will be set on an M1 and T2 cycle edge (so it will show at M1/T3):</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1307.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch 244 set</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We can verify what we've found by running a hand-crafted test code. I used a template test program "test_blank.asm" to code in a couple of instructions, one of them using IX register, and then I run it for a couple of cycles. In a Waveform view window the result shows how the load_ir signal is being asserted at every M1/T3 as well as at M3/T3, when the instruction is using the IX/IY prefix (PLA22 active).</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-wave.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-wave.png" alt=""></a><figcaption>Waveform diagram showing "load_ir" signal (click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Next, load the "annot_internals.json" file by dropping it onto on the application's image view (the main pane).</p>
<p>You can zoom into the area where are all M and T latches located by pasting this command into the Command Window:&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>img.setZoom(0.98); img.setPos(1151,901)</code></p>
<p>On the startup, the app will try to detect latches, and it will detect most of them automatically. For those not detected, you can add them as you find them. The easiest way to find latches is by using the “Driven by” option. After selecting a net and following its signal chain, if you see two nets being driven by each other in a co-dependent loop, you have found a latch that consists of those two nets (they also act as inverters). One of the app's initialization files, "latches.ini" contains definitions of additional latches. You can add to that file as you find latches that the app did not detect.</p>
<p>Schematic view uses an expanded version of such “Driven by” algorithm to build a tree of gates that contribute to the selected net.</p>
<p>Going the other way, the “Driving nets” option assists you to trace an input net as it branches into the network. For example, pick the /RESET input pad and iterate “Driving nets”, following the highlighted lines. Soon, you should reach a “dead end”, with the nets which apparently nothing is driving, here:</p>
<p><code>img.setZoom(2.926); img.setPos(338,606); img.show(294,548,80,101)</code></p>
<p>About these commands: In order to create these zoom and position commands yourself, set up a desired view and then type “img.state()” in the Command window. The required lines will be printed in the Application Log window.</p>
<p>To obtain the coordinates used in the img.show() command, right-click and select an area you wanted to highlight, and then simply read the coordinates from the Log window and paste them into img.show() as arguments.</p>
<p>The particular network mentioned above contains reset input flops and latches. One of the control signals coming out of it is “int_reset”, or internal reset:</p>
<p><code>img.find("int_reset")</code></p>
<p>This signal branches off to different parts of the chip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every chip normally has several signals that are propagated across its die to literally every corner. Some of those networks are power, ground, reset and the clocking network. (Newer chips implement various “gating” to parts of the design to limit the power consumption, but Z80 does not do such thing.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already mention the Waveform view. This view should be familiar to anyone who has worked with simulation tools like ModelSim; but even for the rest, it should still be very simple and intuitive to use.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Waveform view can display signals in a variety of formats</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The important thing to remember is to “name” the net that you wish to observe, if it hasn't been named yet, before you can add it to the waveform view. Double click on the net and select “Edit net name...”. You can type any name; a …</p></div></div>

For Oswald Spengler, the answer was yes. In <em>The Decline of the West </em>he argued that all civilisations go through a similar life-cycle. According to Spengler, the Medieval Era was the spring of the West, the Renaissance its summer, and the Baroque era its autumn. He predicted that the West would enter its Winter around the year 2000, which would be characterised by a decline of democracy due to excessive influence from moneyed interests, and a resultant rise of authoritarianism.</p><p>This prophecy is quickly being fulfilled. The immense power of the financial sector was mobilised to loosen financial regulation, the ultimate result being the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The ensuing austerity sparked the rise of anti-establishment movements with authoritarian tendencies. In countries such as Italy and Hungary, such parties were or are in power.</p><p>The power of money seems set to remain strong in the West. The conditions which necessitated huge bank bailouts have not been eliminated. The revolving door means that many politicians and regulators are incentivised to serve banks while in office in return for very lucrative jobs afterwards. Typical examples of this include former US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, former President of the Bundesbank Axel Weber, former head of the Swiss central bank Philipp Hildebrand, and former German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück, all of whom earned millions from the financial sector during or after their positions in the public sector.</p><p>Since Spengler made his prophecy, the number of threats have multiplied beyond even what he foresaw. In a study of the collapse of the Bronze Age civilisation around 1177 BC, the historian Eric Cline revealed the true horsemen of collapse as being climate change, famines, droughts, earthquakes, rebellions, and mass migration.[1] Any one of these challenges could have been surmountable, but the confluence was fatal. Some are reappearing today, with the pandemic as a new recruit.</p><p>Climate change was the first to manifest. The fact that the ice shelves have begun to splinter is, for now, one worry among many. Of much greater concern are ever more extreme weather events, namely floods and droughts, that strike previously temperate regions. The final result of this could very well be the desertification of large parts of the United States and Southern Europe.[2]</p><p>Reducing our consumption of carbon fuels will not stop this threat. Europe has reduced CO2 emissions by 22 percent since 1990 [3], but the rest of the world, and especially China, continues to burn fossil fuels. According to Vaclav Smil, fossil fuels still supply 90 percent of global primary energy, a greater share than in 2000 when hydropower and nuclear energy were proportionately more widely used.[4] In fact, the success of Europe to date in containing rising emissions may be due to the fact that much energy-intensive manufacturing has already been sent abroad.</p><p>The oceans have also become more hostile to life. They have already begun to acidify due to their absorption of over 20 percent of the increased carbon dioxide in the air. This along with the higher temperature has pushed entire ecosystems such as the coral reefs into collapse, endangering the food supply of the one billion people who rely on the oceans for nourishment.</p><p>It should be no surprise then that the sixth mass extinction is now unfolding. Researchers, looking at 177 mammals for which they had detailed data, found that all have lost at least 30 percent of their geographic range and over 40 percent have undergone sharp population declines.[5]</p><p>Bee and insect populations are collapsing, along with the bird populations who rely on them for food. In France, countryside bird populations have fallen by a third in 15 years.[6] In remote Swiss mountains, plastic has even permeated the soil.[7] Given the complex nature of the ecosystem, the effects of all this are unpredictable.</p><p>Such environmental chaos could force migration, as much of Africa is highly dependent on agriculture for employment and well-being — and this is the sector most exposed to climate change. This is before we even take into account UN projections, according to which the population of Africa is forecast to increase from 1.2bn today to 2.5bn in 2050 and 4.4bn in 2100, at the same time climate change could make much of that continent uninhabitable.</p><p>This will occur in a context where youth bulges could very well lead to civil strife. According to German sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, violence is inevitable when those aged fifteen to thirty comprise over 30 percent of the male population.[8] Similarly, others have found that a majority of conflict in previous decades started in countries where 60 percent of the population is under the age of thirty.[9]&nbsp;In <em>The Clash of Civilizations</em>, Samuel Huntington pointed to demographic trends to predict that many North African and Middle Eastern countries would be unstable today, a prediction borne out by the Arab Spring.[10]</p><p>Such instability be a particular challenge at a time of reduced integration and increased social stratification; integration of migrants is pereived to have failed in some Western European countries, while members of the working class are withdrawing their loyalty from governing elites. Toynbee’s framework indicates that both phenomena may have a common cause.</p><h2>1.2   Toynbee’s Thoughts</h2><p>Arnold Toynbee, a British historian who wrote twelve volumes entitled <em>A Study of History</em>, sought to understand the factors underlying civilisational growth and decline. Toynbee’s principal thesis was that a decline in creativity among the elites precipitates the breakdown of a civilisation. Their inability to devise solutions to the problems of the time leads the masses to cease their deferral to them.</p><p>And who could blame them for this in today’s world? A cursory glance in a newsagent tells us who the dominant cultural figures are: celebrities, sports stars, and perhaps the occasional politician. Yet what are the meaningful achievements of these groups? What risks do they take?</p><p>In a previous age, the leaders of societies literally put their lives on the line for their countries – think of de Gaulle, Churchill and most of the governing classes of the post-War period who had been involved in one if not two wars. This provided a powerful moral authority which today’s leaders lack. Moreover, the leaders of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries wrought the national and international institutions that govern us today – a creative triumph that eludes current leaders.</p><p>Due to numerous scandals, religious figures who once would have been venerated are now mostly disgraced. As for modern celebrities, while many are simply too vapid to be worth imitating, this does not stop the vapid from doing exactly that — to the delight of all manner of brands for whom the celebrity becomes a purchasable ambassador.</p><p>The decline of creativity is also evident in the world of fashion. As Kurt Andersen noted in an essay in <em>Vanity Fair</em>, fashion used to go through radical changes.[11] Every ten years from the 30s to the 90s, style changed radically. It has since stagnated. Taking a longer historical perspective, the dominance of the business suit since the thirties is anomalous, given that for centuries formal wear underwent radical changes relatively frequently.</p><p>How did this creative decline come about? Toynbee noted that once the masses cease to mimic the elite, the elite begins to mimic the masses in an attempt to gain popularity. This process, which Toynbee termed proletarianisation, is already quite advanced: consider the carefully calibrated way in which politicians seek to echo the opinions and language of the electorate. A typical example of this was when former British Prime Minister David Cameron forgot which football team he was meant to support.[12] To this theatre we can add the rise and now ubiquity of profanity, and the decline of formal dress. Perhaps this proletarianisation is the root of the stagnation in fashion: the elites mimic the masses, who are in general less likely to wear something radically different for fear of ridicule.</p><p>At the same time that the achievements of the elites are becoming less impressive, their failings are becoming more visible. Martin Gurri, in his book <em>The Revolt of the Public</em>, identified the internet as a key factor behind the diminishing credibility of elites.[13] The explosion of information has undermined traditional hierarchies, which formerly relied on control of information in order to hide their incompetence and thus preserve their legitimacy.</p><p>These multiple challenges could be tamed in a world where the nations of the West stood strong. Unfortunately, they continue to weaken. One example is the high level of debt in many Western countries, and their inability to stop borrowing. There was no clear plan to reduce such debt levels before the Coronavirus, and now the load has weightened significantly. As such, the West remains prone to a major financial crisis in the event a large economy, such as Italy, slips into bankruptcy.</p><p>As argued by Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University, high levels of government debt will be compounded by extravagant commitments governments have made on pensions and healthcare. These unfunded liabilities are considerable and much greater than the official levels of public debt. In the case of the US, while public debt is around one hundred percent of GDP, the amount of unfunded liabilities is twelve times greater. The equivalent in the UK and the Netherlands is about five times annual GDP, while in France, Germany and Italy it does not exceed a multiple of two.[14]</p><p>In many ways the current difficulties faced by the West are a consequence of ageing: the debt crisis, low economic growth, and low interest rates all arise from a greying society. In Europe, the ageing German population needed to save a vast amount of money at …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

      <h2> Expressing Epidemiological Models</h2>
<p>Understanding how infectious diseases propagate is a key challenge for the 21st century.
Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for studying complex systems that are commonly used in many scientific disciplines.
It is widely used to model infectious diseases in order to study the mechanisms of transmission, explore characteristics of epidemics, predict the future course of an outbreak and evaluate strategies to find a best control-program like quarantine.
The first mathematical model of epidemiology was proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1766 to defend the practice of inoculation against smallpox.
The major contribution to modern mathematical epidemiology was carried out by Kermack and McKendrick who formulated a compartmental model based on relatively simple assumptions on the rates of flow between different classes categorized by epidemiological status.</p>
<p>Kendrick is an embedded domain-specific language in Pharo for defining mathematical models of epidemiology.
This chapter analyzes and visualizes the spatiotemporal evolution of epidemiological models using Roassal.</p>
<p>This chapter was written with the participation of Bui Thi Mai Anh (<a href="mailto:maianht2@gmail.com">maianht2@gmail.com</a>), Serge Stinckwich (<a href="mailto:serge.stinckwich@ird.fr">serge.stinckwich@ird.fr</a>), and Nick Papoulias (<a href="mailto:npapoylias@gmail.com">npapoylias@gmail.com</a>).</p>
<h3>1.  Compartmental models of epidemiology</h3>
<p>The targeted models of the <strong>Kendrick</strong> language are the SIR or SEIR compartmental model in which each individual goes through three distinct phases:</p><ul><li> First an individual is considered to be <em>Susceptible</em> to pathogens (status S),</li><li> Once infected, the individual is <em>Infectious</em> (status I) and spreads the infection,</li><li> After <em>Recovery</em> (status R), the individual is immunized and cannot become infected again.</li></ul>
<p>The transition of status between compartments is represented mathematically as derivatives of compartment size with respect to time.</p>
<p>At the moment, <strong>Kendrick</strong> supports for the mathematical models of epidemiology based on ordinary differential equations (<strong>ODEs</strong>).
The system of ODEs followed represents the SIR classic model of epidemiology (see figure <a href="#equation1">1.1</a>).</p>
<figure><img src="http://agilevisualization.com/AgileVisualization/EpidemiologicalModels/figures/equation1.png" width="35%"><figcaption>1.1. Mathematical description of SIR model using ODEs</figcaption></figure>
<p>These models are specified using the Kendrick domain-specific language and modeled using the simulation modules integrated into Kendrick platform.
The simulator takes a Kendrick model (<em>i.e.,</em> an epidemiological model written in the Kendrick language) and performs a simulation algorithm and outputs the result showing the spatial and temporal evolution dynamics of each compartment.
Roassal visualizes the result.</p>
<p>The simulation module supports three modeling formalisms: deterministic, stochastic and individual-based (also called agent-based).
The modelers can switch between the simulation modes by indicating the algorithm used.</p>
<p>The deterministic simulation resolves the ODEs system of the model and produces numerical results.
Kendrick uses deterministic solvers implemented in the package PolyMath, including RungeKutta and Euler.
These solving methods are used to find numerical approximations to the solutions of ODEs.
The results are always the same for all simulations under the predefined model parameters and initial conditions (initial values of compartments).
Therefore, deterministic models reflect the average dynamics of the disease.</p>
<p>While deterministic models provide insights into the endemic equilibrium and its stability, shifting to stochastic models is known to be more realistic in unrderstanding and predicting the dynamics of diseases.
Kendrick currently supports some Simulation Stochastic Algorithms (SSA) of Gillespie -  converting the ODEs system of the model to stochastic events. After each time step, an event is randomly choosen to be executed.
Kendrick allows one to increase the model accuracy using an individual-based simulator.
Every individual of the population is examined at each time step and each individual has the probability of changing its current status.</p>
<p>The numerical results produced by simulations can be displayed graphically by using visualization modules of Kendrick.
Such modules are implemented based on some features of Roassal.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of visualizations: diagrams (using <code>RTGrapher</code> of Roassal), maps (using <code>RTMapBuilder</code>) and networks (using <code>RTMondrian</code>).</p>
<h3>2.  Visualizing Ebola epidemic outbreak from data</h3>
<p>The website <a href="https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola">https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola</a> provides data that represents the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West African countries.
The following script visualizes data for Guinea and Liberia (Figure <a href="#kendrickEbola01">2.1</a>):

<p>Kendrick is loadable using a Roassal plugin (Figure <a href="#loadingKendrick">3.1</a>):</p>

<h3>4.  Measles model</h3>
<p>Measles is a well-known childhood infectious disease. The most appropriate model representing measles epidemics is the SEIR model where individuals are categorized to be in four classes: first, all newborn individuals are assumed to be in the <em>Susceptible</em> (S) class at birth rate <i>mu</i>, then enter in <em>Exposed</em> (E) class who are infected but not yet infectious with transmission rate , then become <em>Infectious</em> (I) after a latent period given by <i>sigma</i>, and finally change to <em>Recovery</em> after an infectious period <i>gamma</i>. The parameter <em>N</em> represents the total size of the population.
In this example, the diagrams will be used to visualize the dynamics of the infectious disease.
The following script illustrates the SEIR model of measles (Figure <a href="#measles">4.1</a>):
</p><figure><pre><code>	model := KEModel new population: (KEPopulation size: 100000).
	model addAttribute: #status value: #(S E I R).
	model atCompartment: { #status-&gt;#S } put: 99999 atOthersPut: 0.
	model atCompartment: { #status-&gt;#I } put: 1.
	model addEquations: {
	            'S:t=mu*N - beta*S*I - mu*S'.
	            'E:t=beta*S*I - sigma*E - mu*E'.
	            'I:t=sigma*E - gamma*I - mu*I'.
	            'R:t=gamma*I - mu*R'
	            }.
	model addParameters: {
	        #beta-&gt;0.0000214.
	        #gamma-&gt;0.143.
	        #mu-&gt;0.0000351.
	        #sigma-&gt;0.125 }.
	simulator := KESimulator new: #RungeKutta from: 0.0 to: 150 step: 1.
	simulator executeOn: model.
	diag := (KEDiagramBuilder new) data: simulator allTimeSeries.
	diag xLabel: 'Time (days)'.
	diag open</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>
The rates mentioned of the model are introduced as parameters.
This model is run in deterministic simulation in a period of 150 days (using the classical Runge–Kutta method, also known as RK4) with an initial population of 100000 individuals.
Figure <a href="#measles">4.1</a> shows the temporal dynamics of all compartments S, E, I and R.
The Y axis counts the number of individuals in each class and the X axis is the time period of simulation (in days).</p>
<figure><img src="http://agilevisualization.com/AgileVisualization/EpidemiologicalModels/figures/measlesKendrick.png"><figcaption>4.1. Modeling the Measles model with Kendrick</figcaption></figure>
<p>The figure shows that after about 37 days, the endemic reaches the peak, then the number of infectious reduces, and finally the number of recovered individuals increases.</p>
<h3>5.  Complex models in Kendrick</h3>
<p>The modeling of infectious disease involves not only the study of their transmission cycle (as shown in the previous example) but also the effects of the population heterogeneities due to age intervals, sexes, species, viral strains or spatial regions etc.
We consider such heterogeneities as concerns of epidemiology.
The Kendrick DSL allows one to construct a model as a composition of modular models that describe specific epidemiological concerns.
Each concern is separately defined and then integrated into the model.
Look at the following examples.</p>
<h3>6.  Example of multi-host model</h3>
<p>In many situations, due to the fact that the primary hosts do not interact directly to transmit infection, the spreading of diseases requires a secondary host (vector-borne diseases).
In this example, we investigate the mosquito-borne disease with two sources.
Here, the matrix of transmission  indicates that the disease is only transmitted between mosquitos and two reservoirs, so that the main diagonal of this matrix is zero.
A reservoir is the long-term host of a pathogen of an infectious disease. Example of natural reservoirs for pathogens are: rats or bats.
This disease is mathematically formulated as shown in figure <a href="#equation2">6.1</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="http://agilevisualization.com/AgileVisualization/EpidemiologicalModels/figures/equation2.png" width="50%"><figcaption>6.1. Mathematical description of the multi-hosts model using ODEs</figcaption></figure>
<p>We specify the multi-host aspect of epidemiology as a concern (called multi-host concern) and then apply it to the model.</p>
<p>The Kendrick model of this disease is specified as follows:
</p><figure><pre><code>	multiHostConcern := KEConcern new.
	multiHostConcern
		addAttribute: #species
		value: #(#mosquito #reservoir1 #reservoir2).

	model := KEModel new.
	model population: (KEPopulation size: 13000).
	model addAttribute: #status value: #(#S #I #R).
	model addParameters: {
			#beta -&gt; 1.
			#gamma -&gt; 52.
			#mu -&gt; 12.17.
	}.
	model addParameter: #lambda value: 'beta*I'.
	model addEquations: {
		'S:t=mu*N - lambda*S - mu*S'.
		'I:t=lambda*S - gamma*I - mu*I'.
		'R:t=gamma*I - mu*R'
	}.

	model integrate: multiHostConcern.

	…</code></pre></figure></div></div>

</ul><p>The most powerful machine learning models train on a lot of data. Where is this data from? It usually is from the internet and is then
filtered, labeled and curated by humans.  Assuming all data that current machine learning models are trained on is in some form available on the internet, you might need to ask for it on a specific forum, though. A major way forward towards more intelligent machines is to think about ways to allow ML models to
use the internet themselves to learn. This isn’t an access to the “real world”, but is much less expensive than having a robot incarnation of 
an ML model roll around in our 3-dimensional world. Is this 3-dimensional world as important as we think, anyways? Even we spend a pretty fat share of our time interacting with the internet, even though our interfaces to the internet are pretty bad. Compare how much data bandwidth your body has to interact with the world with the share of it that can be used to interact with the internet.</p>

<p>A way to think about an ML model that learns from the internet directly is to look at it as a baby that is left to live on the internet. I would like to describe a three-step curriculum such a model might go through and relate it to human babies to give inspiration for how such a baby-on-the-internet model might learn. Each stage represents a new learning capability, but previously learned capabilities are not forgotten and still used when applicable.</p>

<p>At first it will just experience whatever random things it comes across: articles, terms of service, spam, pictures of random noise, ingredient lists. Just like a small baby can’t choose what it will listen its parents discuss about or what it sees when it is carried around.</p>

<p>In the second step preferences develop for what kind of data to consume. The model will look for data it can incorporate easily, but does not know yet, especially data that helps it understand the world better. It might look at Simple Wikipedia entries, simple images or listen to repetitive music. Similar to a baby that prefers to look into faces over looking into the sky.</p>

<p>The last stage of progress is for the model to interact with the internet and its human users to learn by interaction.
In this last stage I imagine the model to participate in forum discussions, or tweet. The equivalent in humans is to be able to interact with the environment at first by noises or gestures for example, later using language.</p>

<p>I see these stages not only as stages a model goes through during training, but as stages in research as well. Currently we only have stage one models, that learn from whatever they come across and we rarely train them on random samples from the internet directly, since the samples would be noisy and low quality compared to the handcrafted datasets. The next step will be to incorporate stage two learning capabilities, such that training on the internet directly becomes feasible for the first time: the model itself builds the high-quality dataset. 
Finally, at the last step we are able to build models that can interact with the internet, too.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to draw a parallel between ML models in the online world and Sapiens models in the physical world to inspire more people to think about ML models as babies on the web. I really believe that progress can be made if we move forward from our current dataset-centric focus in the machine learning community.</p>

<p><strong>Mass Effect</strong> is a popular franchise of sci-fi roleplaying games. The first game was initially released by BioWare in late 2007 on Xbox 360 exclusively as a part of a publishing deal with Microsoft.
A few months later in mid-2008, the game received PC port developed by Demiurge Studios. It was a decent port with no obvious flaws, that is until 2011 when AMD released their new Bulldozer-based CPUs.
When playing the game on PCs with modern AMD processors, two areas in the game (Noveria and Ilos) show severe graphical artifacts:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://cookieplmonster.github.io/assets/img/posts/mass-effect/me1-blobs.jpg"><br>
<em>Well, that doesn't look nice.</em>
</p>

<p>While not unplayable, it’s definitely distracting. Thankfully, workarounds exist – such as
<a href="http://abesmissioncontrol.blogspot.com/2015/04/mass-effect-fixing-blocky-player-models.html">disabling lighting via console commands</a>
or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect/mods/181">modifying the game’s maps to remove broken lights</a>, but seemingly the issue has never been fully understood.
Some sources claim that an FPS Counter mod can also fix that issue, but I couldn’t find much information about it and the mod’s sources don’t seem to be available online,
and there is no documentation on how the mod tackles this error.</p>

<p>What makes this issue particularly interesting? Vendor-specific bugs are nothing new, and games have had them for decades. However, to my best knowledge, this is the only case where a graphical
issue is caused by a <strong>processor</strong> and not by a graphics card. In the majority of cases, issues happen with a specific vendor of GPU and they don’t care about the CPU, while in this case, it’s the exact opposite.
This makes the issue very unique and worth looking into.</p>

<p>Looking up existing discussions online, this issue seems to affect AMD FX and Ryzen chips. Compared to the older AMD chips, these lack a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DNow!">3DNow! instruction set</a>.
Unrelated or not, the community consensus was that this was the cause of the bug and that the game tried to use those instructions upon detecting an AMD CPU.
Given that there are no known cases of this bug occurring on Intel CPU’s and that 3DNow! instructions were exclusive to AMD, it’s no surprise the community assumed that this is the issue.</p>

<p>Is this really the issue, or is it caused by something entirely different? Let’s find out!</p>



<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>Even though the issue is trivial to reproduce, I couldn’t look into it for the longest time for a simple reason – I don’t have access to any PCs with AMD hardware!
Thankfully, this time I’m not approaching research alone – <a href="https://withinrafael.com/">Rafael Rivera</a> got my back during the entire process of R&amp;D,
providing a test environment with an AMD chip, insights, ideas as well as putting up with hundreds of blind guesses I usually throw around when trying to find the way to the root of such unknown problems.</p>

<p>Since we now had a good testing environment, the first theory to test was of course <code>cpuid</code> – if people are right in assuming that 3DNow! instructions are to blame, there should a place in the game’s code
where they check for their presence, or at the very least check for the CPU vendor. That reasoning is flawed, though; if it was true that the game attempts to use 3DNow! instructions any time it runs on an AMD chip,
without checking if they are supported, the game would most likely crash when trying to execute an illegal instruction. Moreover, a quick scan around the game’s code reveals that the game <strong>doesn’t</strong>
check for CPU capabilities. Therefore, whatever is up with this issue, it doesn’t appear to be caused by the game mis-detecting CPU features, because it seemingly doesn’t care about them in the first place.</p>

<p>When this started looking like an undebuggable case, Rafael came back to me with a realization – disabling <strong>PSGP</strong> (Processor Specific Graphics Pipeline) fixes the issue and the characters are properly lit!
PSGP is not the best documented term, but in short, it’s a legacy (concerning only older DirectX versions) feature allowing Direct3D to perform processor-specific optimizations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In previous versions of DirectX, there was a path that allowed to do vertex processing called the PSGP. Applications had to take this path into account and support a path for vertex processing
on the processor and graphics cores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting it this way, it makes sense why disabling PSGP fixes artifacts on AMD – the path taken by modern AMD processors may be somehow broken.
How to disable it? Two ways come to mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible to pass a <code>D3DCREATE_DISABLE_PSGP_THREADING</code> flag to <code>IDirect3D9::CreateDevice</code>. It’s defined as: <br>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Restrict computation to the main application thread. If the flag is not set, the runtime may perform software vertex processing and other computations in worker thread
to improve performance on multi-processor systems.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Sadly, setting that flag doesn’t fix the issue. Looks like, despite the flag having “PSGP” in name, it’s not what we are looking for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>DirectX specifies two registry entries to disable PSGP in D3D and to disable PSGP only for D3DX – <code>DisablePSGP</code> and <code>DisableD3DXPSGP</code>. Those flags can be set system-wide or process-wide.
For information on how to set them only for a specific process, see <a href="https://withinrafael.com/2020/07/11/specify-application-specific-direct3d-flags/">Rafael Rivera’s guide on enabling application-specific Direct3D flags</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>DisableD3DXPSGP</code> appears to be a viable fix for that issue. Therefore, if you have an aversion towards downloading third party fixes/modifications or you must fix this issue without making
any changes to the game, it’s a perfectly fine way of doing it. As long as you set that flag only for Mass Effect and not system-wide, it’s fine!</p>

<h2 id="pix">PIX</h2>
<p>As always with graphical issues, PIX is likely the most useful tool one could use to diagnose them. We captured similar scenes from Intel and AMD hardware and compared the results.
One difference was instantly noticeable – unlike with my past projects, where <a href="https://cookieplmonster.github.io/2018/07/07/farcry-d3d9-bug/">captures did not carry the bug with them</a> and the same capture
would look different on different PCs (indicating a driver or d3d9.dll bug), these captures carry the bug with them! In other words, a capture from an AMD hardware opened on a PC with Intel hardware
<strong>does</strong> show the bug.</p>

<p>An AMD capture on Intel looks no different than on the hardware it was taken from:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://cookieplmonster.github.io/assets/img/posts/mass-effect/me1-pix1.jpg">
</p>

<p>What does this tell us?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since PIX does not “take screenshots” but instead captures the sequence of D3D commands and executes them on hardware, we can observe that executing the commands captured from an AMD box
results in the same bug when executed on Intel.</li>
  <li>This strongly implies that the difference is not caused by the difference in <strong>how</strong> the commands are executed (that’s how you get GPU specific bugs), but <strong>what</strong> commands are executed.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, it’s almost certainly not any sort of a driver bug. Instead, the way inputs for the GPU are prepared seems to be somehow broken<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. That is indeed a very rare occurrence!</p>

<p>At this point, finding the bug is a matter of finding any jarring differences between captures. It’s tedious, but that’s the only viable way.</p>

<p>After a long while spent poking the capture, a full body draw call caught my attention:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://cookieplmonster.github.io/assets/img/posts/mass-effect/me1-pix2.jpg">
</p>

<p>On an Intel capture, this draw outputs most of the character’s body, together with lighting and textures. On an AMD capture, it outputs a plain black model. This looks like a good trail.</p>

<p>The first obvious candidate for checking would be bound textures, but they seem to be fine and are consistent across captures.
However, some of the pixel shader constants looked weird. Not only do they have NaNs (Not a Number), but they also seem to only appear on the AMD capture and not the Intel capture:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://cookieplmonster.github.io/assets/img/posts/mass-effect/me1-pix3.jpg"><br>
<em>1.#QO indicates a NaN</em>
</p>

<p>This looks promising – NaN values causing strange visuals are not unheard of. Funnily enough, a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2
<a href="https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/7397">had a very similar looking issue in RPCS3</a> which was also related to NaNs!</p>

<p>However, before we get too excited, those values could just be leftovers from previous draws and they might end up being unused for the current draw.
Luckily, in this case it’s clearly visible that those NaNs get submitted to D3D for this specific draw…</p>

//   Name                     Reg   Size
//   ------------------------ ----- ----
//   UpperSkyColor            c10      1

<p>Both constants appear to <a href="https://github.com/abaelhe/unrealengine-old/search?q=UpperSkyColor">come straight from Unreal Engine</a> and judging by the name,
they might directly influence the lighting. Bingo!</p>

<p>A quick in-game test further confirms the theory – on an Intel machine, a vector of 4 NaN values was never submitted as pixel shader constants;
meanwhile, on an AMD machine, NaNs would start showing up as soon as the player entered the area where lighting breaks!</p>

<p>Does it mean work is done? No, far from it, as finding broken constants is only half of the success. The question remains, where do they come from, and can they be replaced?
An in-game test replacing NaN values with zeros partially fixed the issue – ugly black blobs disappeared, but characters were still way too dark:</p>

July 19, 2020 | http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-module-system/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-module-system/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust’s module system is surprisingly confusing and causes a lot of frustration for beginners.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll explain the module system using practical examples so you get a clear understanding of how it works and can immediately start applying this in your projects.</p>
<p>Since Rust’s module system is quite unique, I request the reader to read this post with an open mind and resist comparing it with how modules work in other languages.</p>
<p>Let’s use this file structure to simulate a real world project:</p>
<pre><code>my_project
├── Cargo.toml
└─┬ src
  ├── main.rs
  ├── config.rs
  ├─┬ routes
  │ ├── health_route.rs
  │ └── user_route.rs
  └─┬ models
    └── user_model.rs</code></pre>
<p>These are the different ways we should be able to consume our modules:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-module-system/rust-module-system-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These 3 examples should be sufficient to explain how Rust’s module system works.</p>
<h2 id="Example-1"><a href="#Example-1" title="Example 1"></a>Example 1</h2><p>Let’s start with the first example - importing <code>config.rs</code> in <code>main.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>fn</span> <span>print_config</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"config"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The first mistake that everyone makes is just because we have files like <code>config.rs</code>, <code>health_route.rs</code> etc, we think that these files are <code>modules</code> and we can import them from other files.</p>
<p>Here’s what we see (file system tree) and what the compiler sees (module tree):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-module-system/rust-module-system-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the compiler only sees the <code>crate</code> module which is our <code>main.rs</code> file. This is because we need to explicitly build the module tree in Rust - there’s no implicit mapping between file system tree to module tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to explicitly build the module tree in Rust, there’s no implicit mapping to file system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add a file to the module tree, we need to declare that file as a submodule using the <code>mod</code> keyword. The next thing that confuses people is that you would assume we declare a file as module in the same file. But we need to declare this in a different file! Since we only have <code>main.rs</code> in the module tree, let’s declare <code>config.rs</code> as a submodule in <code>main.rs</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mod keyword declares a submodule</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>mod</code> keyword has this syntax:</p>
<pre><code><span>mod</span> my_module<span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, the compiler looks for <code>my_module.rs</code> or <code>my_module/mod.rs</code> in the same directory.</p>
<pre><code>my_project
├── Cargo.toml
└─┬ src
  ├── main.rs
  └── my_module.rs

or

my_project
├── Cargo.toml
└─┬ src
  ├── main.rs
  └─┬ my_module
    └── mod.rs</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>main.rs</code> and <code>config.rs</code> are in the same directory, let’s declare the config module as follows:</p>
<pre><code>// main.rs
<span>+ mod config;</span>

fn main() {
<span>+ config::print_config();</span>
  println!("main");
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>fn</span> <span>print_config</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"config"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We’re accessing the <code>print_config</code> function using the <code>::</code> syntax.</p>
<p>Here’s how the module tree looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-module-system/rust-module-system-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We’ve successfully declared the <code>config</code> module! But this is not sufficient to be able to call the <code>print_config</code> function inside <code>config.rs</code>. Almost everything in Rust is private by default, we need to make the function public using the <code>pub</code> keyword:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pub keyword makes things public</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>
<span>mod</span> config<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  config<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>print_config</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>// config.rs
<span>- fn print_config() {</span>
<span>+ pub fn print_config() {</span>
  println!("config");
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, this works. We’ve successfully called a function defined in a different file!</p>
<h2 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" title="Example 2"></a>Example 2</h2><p>Let’s try calling the <code>print_health_route</code> function defined in <code>routes/health_route.rs</code> from <code>main.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>mod</span> config<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  config<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>print_config</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>fn</span> <span>print_health_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"health_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>As we discussed earlier, we can use the <code>mod</code> keyword only for <code>my_module.rs</code> or <code>my_module/mod.rs</code> in the same directory.</p>
<p>So in order to call functions inside <code>routes/health_route.rs</code> from <code>main.rs</code>, we need to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file named <code>routes/mod.rs</code> and declare the <code>routes</code> submodule in <code>main.rs</code></li>
<li>Declare the <code>health_route</code> submodule in <code>routes/mod.rs</code> and make it public</li>
<li>Make the functions inside <code>health_route.rs</code> public</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>my_project
├── Cargo.toml
└─┬ src
  ├── main.rs
  ├── config.rs
  ├─┬ routes
<span>+ │ ├── mod.rs</span>
  │ ├── health_route.rs
  │ └── user_route.rs
  └─┬ models
    └── user_model.rs</code></pre>
<pre><code>// main.rs
mod config;
<span>+ mod routes;</span>

fn main() {
<span>+ routes::health_route::print_health_route();</span>
  config::print_config();
  println!("main");
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// routes/mod.rs
<span>+ pub mod health_route;</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>// routes/health_route.rs
<span>- fn print_health_route() {</span>
<span>+ pub fn print_health_route() {</span>
  println!("health_route");
}</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how the module tree looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-module-system/rust-module-system-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can now call a function defined in a file inside a folder.</p>
<h2 id="Example-3"><a href="#Example-3" title="Example 3"></a>Example 3</h2><p>Let’s try calling from <code>main.rs =&gt; routes/user_route.rs =&gt; models/user_model.rs</code></p>
<pre><code>
<span>mod</span> config<span>;</span>
<span>mod</span> routes<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  routes<span>:</span><span>:</span>health_route<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>print_health_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  config<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>print_config</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>fn</span> <span>print_user_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"user_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>fn</span> <span>print_user_model</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"user_model"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We want to call the function <code>print_user_model</code> from <code>print_user_route</code> from <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s make the same changes as before - declaring submodules, making functions public and adding the <code>mod.rs</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>my_project
├── Cargo.toml
└─┬ src
  ├── main.rs
  ├── config.rs
  ├─┬ routes
  │ ├── mod.rs
  │ ├── health_route.rs
  │ └── user_route.rs
  └─┬ models
<span>+   ├── mod.rs</span>
    └── user_model.rs</code></pre>
<pre><code>// main.rs
mod config;
mod routes;
<span>+ mod models;</span>

fn main() {
  routes::health_route::print_health_route();
<span>+ routes::user_route::print_user_route();</span>
  config::print_config();
  println!("main");
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// routes/mod.rs
pub mod health_route;
<span>+ pub mod user_route;</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>// routes/user_route.rs
<span>- fn print_user_route() {</span>
<span>+ pub fn print_user_route() {</span>
  println!("user_route");
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// models/mod.rs
<span>+ pub mod user_model;</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>// models/user_model.rs
<span>- fn print_user_model() {</span>
<span>+ pub fn print_user_model() {</span>
  println!("user_model");
}</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how the module tree looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-module-system/rust-module-system-5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wait, we haven’t actually called <code>print_user_model</code> from <code>print_user_route</code>! So far, we’ve only called the functions defined in other modules from <code>main.rs</code>, how do we do that from other files?</p>
<p>If we look at our module tree, the <code>print_user_model</code> function sits in the <code>crate::models::user_model</code> path. So in order to use a module in files that are not <code>main.rs</code>, we should think in terms of the path necessary to reach that module in the module tree.</p>
<pre><code>// routes/user_route.rs
pub fn print_user_route() {
<span>+ crate::models::user_model::print_user_model();</span>
  println!("user_route");
}</code></pre>
<p>We’ve successfully called a function defined in a file from a file that’s not <code>main.rs</code>.</p>
<h2 id="super"><a href="#super" title="super"></a>super</h2><p>The fully qualified name gets too lengthy if our file organization is multiple directories deep. Let’s say for whatever reason, we want to call <code>print_health_route</code> from <code>print_user_route</code>. These are under the paths <code>crate::routes::health_route</code> and <code>crate::routes::user_route</code> respectively.</p>
<p>We can call it by using the fully qualified name <code>crate::routes::health_route::print_health_route()</code> but we can also use a relative path <code>super::health_route::print_health_route();</code>. Notice that we’ve used <code>super</code> to refer to the parent scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The super keyword in module path refers to the parent scope</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>print_user_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>crate</span><span>:</span><span>:</span>routes<span>:</span><span>:</span>health_route<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>print_health_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
  <span>super</span><span>:</span><span>:</span>health_route<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>print_health_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"user_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="use"><a href="#use" title="use"></a>use</h2><p>It would be tedious to use the fully qualified name or even the relative name in the above examples. In order to shorten the names, we can use the <code>use</code> keyword to bind the path to a new name or alias.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use keyword is used to shorten the module path</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>print_user_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>crate</span><span>:</span><span>:</span>models<span>:</span><span>:</span>user_model<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>print_user_model</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"user_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The above code can be refactored as:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> <span>crate</span><span>:</span><span>:</span>models<span>:</span><span>:</span>user_model<span>:</span><span>:</span>print_user_model<span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>print_user_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>print_user_model</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"user_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of using the name <code>print_user_model</code>, we can also alias it to something else:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> <span>crate</span><span>:</span><span>:</span>models<span>:</span><span>:</span>user_model<span>:</span><span>:</span>print_user_model <span>as</span> log_user_model<span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>print_user_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>log_user_model</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"user_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="External-modules"><a href="#External-modules" title="External modules"></a>External modules</h2><p>Dependencies added to <code>Cargo.toml</code> are available globally to all modules inside the project. We don’t need to explicitly import or declare anything to use a dependency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>External dependencies are globally available to all modules inside a project</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, let’s say we added the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rand</a> crate to our project. We can use it in our code directly as:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>print_health_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> random_number<span>:</span> u8 <span>=</span> rand<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> random_number<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"health_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>use</code> to shorten the path:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> rand<span>:</span><span>:</span>random<span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>print_health_route</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> random_number<span>:</span> u8 <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> random_number<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"health_route"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><ul>
<li>The module system is explicit - there’s no 1:1 mapping with file system</li>
<li>We declare a file as module in its parent, not in itself</li>
<li>The <code>mod</code> keyword is used to declare submodules</li>
<li>We need to explicitly declare functions, structs etc as public so they can be consumed in other modules</li>
<li>The <code>pub</code> keyword makes things public</li>
<li>The <code>use</code> keyword is used to shorten the module path</li>
<li>We don’t need to explicitly declare 3rd party modules</li>

with <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> to trigger automations.
I’ve laid out all the information below on how you can use NFC Tags to automate
other apps and devices as well!</p><p>I really like using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">Near Field Communication (NFC)</a>
for home or device based automations because it is really cheap and the
possibilities are endless as you can place them in any environmental condition
and on almost any physical object.</p><p>Here are some of the ways you could use NFC Tags to trigger home automations:</p><ul><li>Place a tag next to your bed to activate good morning/night routines.</li><li>Place a tag next to a door to automatically unlock a door (presence detection is hard).</li><li>Place a tag on the lawn mower and have an automation to open the Garage Door.</li><li>Place a tag under a bed to trigger an emergency action like trigger alarm.</li><li>Place a tag outside next to patio furniture to turn on lights or music.</li><li>Place a tag next to a lamp with a smart bulb to turn it on or off.</li><li>Place a tag next to the cat litter to trigger a future reminder to change it.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the ways you could use NFC Tags to trigger device automations:</p><ul><li>Sharing Guest Wifi information!</li><li>Place under a bed to trigger an emergency action like text emergency services.</li><li>Place a tag by your relaxation place and automatically play relaxing music.</li><li>Put one on your bag and tap it to trigger airplane mode or silence your phone.</li></ul><blockquote><p>A huge shout out to <a href="https://www.architectryan.com/">Ryan Hoffman</a> who inspired
me to look into using NFC after sharing his experiences with it. I’m not sure
I would have stumbled upon NFC Tags otherwise.</p></blockquote><h2 id="what-tag-should-i-get">What Tag Should I Get?</h2><p>There are many different types of <a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/nfc-tag1.htm">NFC tags</a>
that have different form factors, features (write locking, password protection,
number of writes, etc).</p><p>I really like these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015EM34WY?tag=niemyjski-20">heavy duty Type 2 NFC Tags</a>
as they are waterproof, safe for outdoor use and supports all of the NFC
features you’d expect (locking, multi-write, password protection). Additionally,
they come with 3M adhesive backing so you can literally stick them anywhere!</p><p><img src="https://blakeniemyjski.com/img/blog/home-automation/nfc-tag-door-lock-700.png" alt="NFC Tag Near Door"></p><blockquote><p>I could have done more research and found a tag that blended in better with my
door, please keep this in mind when picking out where you want to place these.</p></blockquote><p>You can get NFC Tags in
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015UMPVNI?tag=niemyjski-20">sticker form</a>
as well. Just be sure it supports your all of your requirements. Here are some
factors you might want to consider:</p><ul><li>Location: Some tags are not waterproof and some don’t work on metal surfaces.</li><li>Device support: Will this work with the devices I want to use it with (e.g., iPhone).</li><li>Updatable: Do you need to update this tag once installed (eg., Can I lock it, or write to it multiple times)?</li><li>Form Factor: Does this need to be a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015UMPVNI?tag=niemyjski-20">sticker</a>?</li><li>Color: Does this blend in with the surrounding?</li></ul><h2 id="nfc-tag-tips">NFC Tag Tips</h2><p>It’s important to note that you should associate a name or identifier to a tag
or to the event name you trigger. I’d <strong>strongly recommend</strong> creating tags with
sequentially or with random characters like <code>nfc_tag_1</code> and not with a specific
name like <code>office_lights_tag</code>. The reason behind this is this because you can:</p><ul><li>Potentially leak information publicly as it can be read by anyone with an NFC device.</li><li>Prevents you from reusing tags at a later date.</li></ul><p>Finally, don’t store anything you don’t publicly want exposed (e.g., api keys,
IP addresses, …). Tags can be copied / cloned with enough work. I’ve yet to
figure out how to encrypt the payload of a tag but I’ve seen encrypted tags
mentioned around in my various searches. Even still I wouldn’t put anything
sensitive on a tag!</p><h2 id="triggering-events-when-nfc-is-detected">Triggering events when NFC is detected.</h2><p>I’m pretty new to NFC but in my adventures I’ve only come across two ways to
trigger Home Assistant events when an NFC Tag is detected. You can do it via
the Shortcuts App or via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking">deep</a>/universal
linking.</p><blockquote><p>This article primarily focuses on iOS support as I don’t have any android
devices to try on. The following links may need to be slightly tweaked.
Please leave a comment below on what worked for you and I’ll update this article.</p></blockquote><p>Please note that there are deep links for a wide range of
<a href="http://x-callback-url.com/apps/">applications</a> that you could use NFC tags on.</p><blockquote><p>Skip to the <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a> if you are looking for my recommendations
on what solution to go with.</p></blockquote><h3 id="deep-universal-links">Deep/Universal links</h3><p>For simplicity sake a deep/universal link will open an application with some
arguments contained in the link of which can trigger an action. You can read
more about the differences <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35522618/universal-links-on-ios-vs-deep-links-url-schemes">here</a>.</p><p>You can do a <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/integrations/url-handler/">wide range of actions</a>
with links like Call Services, Fire Events or Send a Location.</p><p>The advantage of using Deep/Universal links is it allows any authorized
user to execute a Home Assistant action with no configuration defined on
device.</p><h4 id="deep-link">Deep link</h4><p>The following Deep link <a href="homeassistant://fire_event/nfc_tag_1"><code>homeassistant://fire_event/nfc_tag_1</code></a>
will launch the Home Assistant application if it’s installed, fire an event
called <code>nfc_tag_1</code> and show an alert dialog saying the <code>nfc_tag_1</code> event has
been called.</p><p><img src="https://blakeniemyjski.com/img/blog/home-automation/home-assistant-ios-app-fired-event-397.png" alt="Fired Event"></p><p>This is less than ideal as you don’t really want a notification interrupting you.
The application opening is jarring enough.</p><h4 id="deep-link-without-notification">Deep link without notification</h4><p>Luckily we can take advantage of a feature called
<a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/integrations/x-callback-url"><code>x-callback-url</code></a>.
This allows us to trigger application actions without a notification. We simply
need to modify the url to
<a href="homeassistant://x-callback-url/fire_event?eventName=nfc_tag_1"><code>homeassistant://x-callback-url/fire_event?eventName=nfc_tag_1</code></a></p><h4 id="universal-link">Universal link</h4><p>Deep links work great as long as the application you are linking to is installed.
If it isn’t, than the link will do nothing. This is one of the problems
<a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/integrations/universal-links">Universal links</a>
solve by redirecting you to the App Store if the application isn’t
currently installed.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: Universal links like <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/ios/nfc/">https://www.home-assistant.io/ios/nfc/</a> are
registered when you install the application and works offline!</p></blockquote><p>Here is the Universal link you’d need to register
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/ios/nfc/?url=homeassistant://x-callback-url/fire_event?eventName=nfc_tag_1"><code>https://www.home-assistant.io/ios/nfc/?url=homeassistant://x-callback-url/fire_event?eventName=nfc_tag_1</code></a>
to fire the action without a notification.</p><h4 id="writing-links-to-nfc-tag">Writing links to NFC Tag</h4><p>I used the free application called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749">NFC Tools</a>
which is also available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a>.</p><p>Open the application and follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>Select the <code>Write</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>Add a record</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>URL / URI</code> option.</li><li>Enter in your Deep/Universal link and select <code>OK</code>.</li><li>Select the <code>Write / xx Bytes</code> button to write the link to the NFC Tag.</li></ol><p><img src="https://blakeniemyjski.com/img/blog/home-automation/nfc-tools-write-record-1200.png" alt="Write"></p><p>When your phone gets close to the NFC tag it will launch a banner prompting
you to click on it to activate the event.</p><p><img src="https://blakeniemyjski.com/img/blog/home-automation/home-assistant-nfc-tag-banner-1192.jpeg" alt="Open in Home Assistant NFC Tag"></p><p>This isn’t ideal but it’s in place for
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/adding_support_for_background_tag_reading">security reasons</a>
so your phone doesn’t automatically execute tasks.</p><h3 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h3><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752">Shortcuts</a> is an iOS
application made by apple that allows you do device based tasks or automations
much like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en_US">Tasker</a>
on Android.</p><p>Shortcuts define tasks and automations in the app that can get triggered several
ways. Shortcut tasks can be shared across devices easily. However Shortcuts
Automations cannot be shared and is currently the only way to trigger an
action when an NFC tag is detected without any prompts.</p><p>The nice thing about Shortcuts is you can have it automate anything (e.g.,
texting, application actions, video calling and more).</p><h4 id="shortcut">Shortcut</h4><p>There are two kind of Shortcuts you can create. The first is referred to a
Shortcut and can be shared or triggered from automations or by NFC Tags. The
second is called Shortcut Automations and those get triggered automatically
based on some kind of action or state like coming into proximity to a NFC Tag.
Shortcut Automations cannot currently be shared as of iOS 13.</p><h5 id="creating-a-new-shortcut">Creating a new Shortcut</h5><p>We first need to create a new Shortcut in order for a NFC tag to trigger it.</p><p>Open the Shortcuts application and follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>Select the <code>Create Shortcut</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>Add Action</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>Apps</code> button and select <code>Home Assistant</code>.</li><li>Select the <code>Fire Event</code> option.</li><li>Enter in the event name you wish to trigger (e.g., <code>nfc_tag_1</code>).</li><li>Select <code>Show More</code> and enter in <code>{}</code> for the <code>Event Data</code>.

We
can now write to an NFC Tag to tell it to run the Shortcut we just added when
the tag is read by our device.</p><h5 id="writing-shortcut-to-nfc-tag">Writing Shortcut to NFC Tag</h5><p>I used the free application called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749">NFC Tools</a>
to write the Shortcut to the NFC Tag.</p><p>Open the application and follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>Select the <code>Write</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>Add a record</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>Shortcut</code> option.</li><li>Enter in the name of the Shortcut and select <code>OK</code>.</li><li>Select the <code>Write / xx Bytes</code> button to write the link to the NFC Tag.</li></ol><p>When your phone gets close to the NFC tag it will launch a banner prompting

automatically execute tasks.</p><h4 id="shortcuts-automations">Shortcuts Automations</h4><p>As stated previously, Automations are setup in the Shortcut apps and cannot be
shared across devices. Which means this will become a lot of work to maintain if
you have more than one user who will be using NFC Tag for automations. The plus
side is you don’t need to write anything to the NFC Tag to use these automations
and they run without any user interaction. I think this is the biggest win of
this approach.</p><p>Open the Shortcuts application and follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>Select the Automation tab.</li><li>Select the <code>Add</code> icon button.</li><li>Select the <code>Create Personal Automation</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>NFC</code> option under the <code>Settings Category</code>.</li><li>Select the <code>Scan</code> button and scan your NFC Tag.</li><li>Enter in the event name as the Shortcut name (e.g., <code>nfc_tag_1</code>).</li><li>Select the <code>Next</code> button.</li><li>Select the <code>Apps</code> button and select <code>Home Assistant</code>.</li><li>Select the <code>Fire Event</code> option.</li><li>Enter in the event name you wish to trigger (e.g., <code>nfc_tag_1</code>).</li><li>Select <code>Show More</code> and enter in <code>{}</code> for the <code>Event Data</code>.</li><li>Select the <code>Next</code> button.</li><li>Turn off <code>Ask Before Running</code>, unless you wish to be prompted.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><em>I'm sorry, but my blog won't be complete unless I write something about privacy. This post was supposed to be about personal privacy but under the influence of alcohol has slipped into big data, so do not judge and read the following article about personal privacy.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say. 
― Edward Snowden</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>You have something to hide</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who cares about me?"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have nothing to hide."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't have anything important, why do I need privacy?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument "I have nothing to hide" is ridiculous and moreover it destroys a person's motivation and reinforces the uselessness of any further efforts. Often the reason for that argument being said is because a <strong>person is unaware of his or her assets</strong>. A person diminishes the importance of the information he or she possesses or processes. It must be understood that privacy is not just about having something to hide, <strong>it's also about keeping information available only to yourself</strong>. Some information just shouldn't concern other people.</p>
<p>It's not only about hiding but also <strong>about protecting</strong>. You defend your assets — it is natural and absolutely clear. Among digital assets, passwords, and PIN codes are the most obvious. You don't tell anyone the password from your email box. You are unlikely to be delighted if someone steals your Facebook account and starts spreading offensive messages, viruses, or spam. You are not hiding the facts here — yes, you have a bank account, an email, a Facebook account. It is not a secret. You are protecting what's listed from unauthorized, arbitrary access, from using your data against your interests.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/big-data-big-privacy-hole/big-data-big-privacy-hole-2.png"></p><p>We don't make it a secret that we own a car, but we use a seatbelt to protect our health and life. These are undeniable physical assets. The same goes for online privacy — you would like to tell your friends where to find you on sunday night, but you don't want a maniac with skills to know about it — you would probably reschedule your plans.</p>
<p>People who "have nothing to hide" easily spread their careless approach to others. They do not wonder what a complex and interconnected world we live in today. Remember that we are in close communication with others who may have their own assets and rules. You don't want to set people up, your loved ones, your friends. Especially if they are the people who are vulnerable and belong to a "risk group". People often ask this question when it comes to personal security — something like "<em>Why would a hacker hack me?</em>" without realizing that maybe the hacker is not interested in them.</p>
<p>Going into the digital era, people forget that crime is also going into the digital era. Earlier people were robbed on the streets, now the robbers choose to be on the Internet and use the same information that people themselves voluntarily made public. Those people who say that they have nothing to hide and easily publish their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html">photos</a> or phone numbers on the internet exposes themselves to very high risk. Usually, when people think about their information on the Internet, they think about their IP address and search history, but in reality, the rate of keystrokes is recorded, how you move the mouse, what routes you take to work, through the camera it is possible to analyze where you look on the screen — and this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>I am surprised by the sluggishness of people — there are so many fans of conspiracy theories in the world. The average inhabitant of the planet is easier to live with the idea of a universal conspiracy of manipulating the consciousness of mankind via microchipping than to realize that it exists for years already. Information is already being recorded from everyone, and there is a global manipulation of behavior. But it's not comfortable for people to think about it.</p>
<h2>Companies</h2>
<p>Cybercriminals are actually a smaller problem, they're not really interested in everyone. The most dangerous criminals are corporations and marketing experts — they want everyone's information.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/big-data-big-privacy-hole/big-data-big-privacy-hole-3.png"></p><p>The new business model for many companies is to provide free content or service in exchange for a person's data. Many of us accept this — we often accept long and confusing documents with terms and conditions — in fact, we do not object to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-chrome-exclusive/exclusive-massive-spying-on-users-of-googles-chrome-shows-new-security-weakness-idUSKBN23P0JO">some information being collected</a> in exchange for free service. With increasing digitalization, we unconsciously <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/08/apple-scans-icloud-photos-check-child-abuse/">giveaway a huge amount of information</a> about ourselves every day, receiving much less than we thought in return.</p>
<p>We are also losing one small detail. Since our data is then stored in proprietary repositories, out of our sight, we lose direct control over that data and choice when and with whom to share it. Moreover, we often do not have the opportunity to revoke access to those data for companies that we would rather not share, especially with third parties — it is just all or nothing. Are you sure that all the services you are using are concerned about security and will never use your data against you? <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/ufo-vpn-data-exposure/">Well, I'm not sure</a>.</p>
<p>And I haven't said anything about the government yet, in the post-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/leaked-cambridge-analyticas-blueprint-for-trump-victory">cambridge-analytica</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">snowden</a> world I don't know what I can add there.</p>
<h3>Big Data</h3>
<p>The whole life of any person nowadays is tied to devices, to social networks, to virtual life. And with the growing number of IoT, devices are everywhere and our role has changed — <strong>a person became a sensor of a system that belongs to someone else</strong>. Each of us has a very big digital footprint, which is much more than we are shown or thought to be. And all our data created and collected by applications and it is stored not on our phones, but in the clouds, on remote servers around the world, owned not by you and me, but corporations that collect this data for their own purposes. But collecting this data is not the worst problem for us as users, but leveraging big data and intelligent analysis technologies together open up the side of big data that is really scary.</p>
<p>Big data analysis systems work with huge amounts of information. The more unique (read "more private") this data is, the more interesting and intimidating conclusions can be drawn from them using modern methods. Imagine that any company you are associated with has four types of information about you. The first one is Personally Identifiable Information (PII) — this is information that allows anyone to directly identify and contact you, such as your name, social security number, email address, phone number, and so on. The second type is Quasi-Identifiers (QI), which in itself is information that is too general and does not provide any insight into you, but in combination, these QIs <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/publications/simple-demographics-often-identify-people-uniquely">uniquely identify 87% of the US population</a>. This is information such as ZIP code, age, gender, etc. There is also Sensitive information that you would like to tell only your wife and doctor, better only your doctor, it could be preferences, salary, sickness, etc. And the last type of information let's call it "everything else" — anything that does not fall under the definition of the others.</p>
<p>Despite all the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>, <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei_Geral_de_Prote%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Dados_Pessoais">LGPD</a> things that have occurred recently, personal privacy is still not protected. Obviously, simply removing the PII columns from the dataset is not enough to protect privacy (which is what is behind all of these acronyms). Even if basic demographic data (which qualifies as QI) is present in the dataset, it can be combined with other publicly available data sources and identify people with great accuracy. The use of big data technologies and analytics blurs the legal and technical limitations with which people maintain privacy.</p>
<p>Another type of harm occurs as a result of combining small fragments of seemingly harmless information. If such information is combined, it can tell much (much) more. By combining pieces of information that we may not care much about protecting, the government and companies may collect information that we would like to hide. For example, suppose you bought a book about cancer. This purchase alone will say little about anything, as it simply indicates your interest in the disease. Let's say you bought a wig. You can buy a wig for many reasons. But if you combine these two pieces of information into one, one can assume that you have cancer and are undergoing chemotherapy. You might not want to tell others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/opinion/facebook-cancer-ads.html">this information</a>, but <strong>you definitely want to have a choice</strong>.</p>
<h3>Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?</h3>
<p>All small businesses competing with big data companies are like playing chess with a computer and hoping for luck. They play and think they are really cool, but the computer has already seen millions of games and it has a mathematical probabilistic model that says clearly how and when it will win if it will do a particular move. And those small businesses have lost already, they just don't know it yet.</p>
<p>Data is the most valuable thing on the Internet. It's the new gold, new oil. If you work with the data properly, you have the advantage. The market is literally killing competitiveness — you want to compete with Amazon? An innovative startup may be 100 times better and cooler than Amazon, but technically it doesn't matter. A company with a lot of data and a lot of money will take a look at this startup and copy the most interesting things and most importantly apply the experience of X billion people to it. It's already know how consumers will behave in different situations. Those who do not have this knowledge will eventually die.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/big-data-big-privacy-hole/big-data-big-privacy-hole-4.png" alt="AI"></p>
<p>Everybody must have read Orwell's 1984, which has posters with "Big Brother is watching you". Imagine if you finally open the door to Big Brother's office, what would you see there?</p>
<p><strong>Actually, it is artificial intelligence.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">When you think about AI it's almost always wrong</a>, so by AI here I mean the idea to incorporate human intelligence into a machine, not replicate, not mimic, but incorporate.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>I spent a considerable time on my <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://mavio.fr/">budget app</a> side project built in Flutter. After a year of development and 25k lines of code later, I wanted to create a blog post about how everything went and my feedback on working with this framework.</p>

<h2 id="the-dart-language">The Dart language</h2>

<p>Flutter is built with Dart, a Javascript/Java inspired language. Dart was built internally at Google with the specific goal to replace Javascript on the web as a saner language, with better defaults. Unfortunately for the Dart team, the project never took off, Dart was stuck in a limbo state for a few years while still being maintained for internal Google needs.</p>

<p>The language itself had very good features which enabled other uses cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Dart VM is a wonderful piece of technology, build with hot reloading at its core</li>
  <li>The language can be interpreted or compiled natively for better performance</li>
  <li>The Dart tooling around the language well built</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully expected the language to be an issue on the project since it’s so niche, but actually it has been a great experience on that level. It’s quick to learn and very easy to pick up, especially if you have done some Javascript previously.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-parts">The good parts</h2>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<p>The Flutter tooling is one of it’s strong parts. Hot reloading your code <strong>actually</strong> works, Flutter is almost the only piece of technology I’ve ever used where the hot reload was working as well as it is. Generally I would disable it elsewhere, it even makes you miss it in other languages.</p>

<p>The package manager (pub) works great, upgrades are smooth (if you are coming from the npm world, it’s honestly a breath of fresh air). After a year of managing my project, I only had a single conflict where I had to pin a specific version of a package to avoid a compilation error with the main Flutter SDK, that only lasted two weeks and then upgrades were smooth again.</p>

<p>The Flutter SDK has multiple channels (master, dev, beta and stable), the stable version is quite good as not reintroducing regressions and flutter upgrades can be done from the command line easily.</p>

<p>The language server in VSCode works perfectly, autocompletion also works wonders, the Dart code formatter is also one of the best I used, I consider it on par with Go, which is one of the best in my opinion.</p>

<h3 id="performance--animations">Performance &amp; Animations</h3>

<p>Flutter uses Skia, an internal and very performant render engine which draws everything to a canvas. Performance is definitely a strong point of the platform. I use a very cheap Samsung J3 as my daily driver which is almost the bottom of the barrel in terms of performance in 2020. Basically every app on my phone is lagging noticeably, including Google apps. My budget app on the other hand is the quickest app on my phone, by a long margin. If you are targetting a market with a lot of low-end budget phones, Flutter is exactly what you need.</p>

<p>Animations are also a very strong point of this platform, high-speed animations can be built with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rive.app/">Rive</a> and imported directly into Flutter, rendered at full speed and weighting a few Kb. I do have a few toy animations built with Rive on my app.</p>

<h3 id="portability">Portability</h3>

<p>I have not published the iOS version yet due to Apple developer account issues but my budget app already works without much effort identically on Android, Linux, Windows &amp; macOS thanks to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover">Hover</a>.</p>

<p>If you are building a desktop app, Flutter can be a good technology to keep in mind. It produces small binaries, fast and reactive applications, works cross-platform and won’t use too much RAM like most Electron apps.</p>

<p>Desktop support is still in an alpha quality at the moment so expect some missing features, you might have to dig into the code and make some pull requests.</p>

<h3 id="the-flutter-sdk">The Flutter SDK</h3>

<p>The SDK is quite complete, a lot of basic and complex components are there. The SDK has material design guidelines by default, which might be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>While you can make your application look native with more work but generally it’s not what you would use Flutter for. Flutter shines primarily as building complex apps which have their own design goals.</p>

<h3 id="styling">Styling</h3>

<p>Styling will look familiar if you are coming from a web background. You will have a stripped-down version of flex, padding &amp; margins, border-radius, font-weight…</p>

<p>The main difference being that there’s a global Flutter theme which applies to your whole app instead of classes. This makes it easier to swap the theme to make a dark theme.</p>

<p>I’m still trying to make my stying code looks nicer, extending the main theme seems to be the right approach.</p>

<h2 id="the-parts-which-would-need-improvements">The parts which would need improvements</h2>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>Testing isn’t that bad, especially if you are coming from the Javascript world. A lot of the testing building blocks you expect are there and you do have a driver where you can tap on elements and see what happens.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/172a2207d60b86a77bfc854290aa6349be0d69a7/3e636/images/flutter-test-terminal.png" alt="A screenshot of a terminal showing that 174 tests passed in 4 minutes 43 seconds"></p>
  <figcaption>Yay! Hopefully everything works.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you come from the Ruby world however, the testing will feel pretty average and you might find yourself needing a bit more boilerplate than you would expect. There’s definitely some room to make testing more enjoyable and faster to write.</p>

<p>There is also no mutation testing in Dart yet (that I’m aware of), so you will have to use the code coverage tool extensively in the mean time and try to catch as much as you can. I had a pretty blocking bug on the code coverage tool which has been fixed in one of the more recent stable versions so I can recommend it now.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Navigation works stateless in Flutter. That can be a great thing, especially when you are importing packages, no need to plug your router for using packages, there’s one big issue however, it’s not really possible to micro-manage the view state when you use the go back button on Android.</p>

<p>That can be a problem for knowing which route you are on at the moment if you want to update the bottom bar with an indicator for example. As far as I know, it’s still an unsolved problem, unless you rebuild an entire navigation system yourself with Provider or another Flutter state management library. I’ll probably do that in the future but that’s a lower priority bug at the moment.</p>

<h3 id="webviews">Webviews</h3>

<p>If you need Webviews for your project (which I needed), it might be a blocker in the current state. Webviews don’t support multiple tabs (which means <em>window.open</em> won’t work in Javascript), the view might crash and there is poor keyboard support at the moment.</p>

<p>Additionally, this alpha-state Webview is only available on Android and iOS, not on any desktop platform yet.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As far as the Flutter platform goes, it’s been a pretty enjoyable experience for me. I will write one or more retrospective blog post on this project. I do recommend Flutter and even as a web developer, where you might prefer React Native initially due to the familiarity with Javascript, I would recommend trying Flutter, it will surprise you.</p>

<li><code>hostgssenc</code> - TCP/IP only GSSAPI</li>
<li><code>hostnogssenc</code> - TCP/IP only without GSSAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>DATABASE</code> we can specify database name or use special value <code>sameuser</code> if database name should be same as name of user that is connecting.</p>
<p>With <code>USER</code> we can specify user or role - role name should be preceded by <code>+</code> sign.</p>
<p><code>ADDRESS</code> field could be - hostname, IP range in CIDR format or special words:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samehost</code> - which correspond to all IP adresses of database server</li>
<li><code>samenet</code> - which correspond to all IP in database server subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>METHOD</code> field we can set one of authentication methods - most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust</code> - allow connection without password - moslty set for local connections from database server itself</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - reject connections</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - allow connections after getting from user password - encrypted</li>
<li><code>password</code> - allow connection after getting plain password - DO NOT USE in untrusted networks - better -&gt; never use this option</li>
<li><code>ldap</code> - getting account authorization data from LDAP server</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>DATABASE</code> and <code>USER</code> fields you can specify special word <code>all</code> if you don’t want to create any restrictions here.</p>
<p>There can be situation when we must use additional field named <code>auth-options</code> for specyfying details for example for <code>hostssl</code> connection type. This topic will be covered in another post.</p>

<p>OpenAI is an artifical intelligence company co-founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and a few others with funding from the likes of Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and Microsoft. The company’s mission is “to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity”.</p>



<p>In the last few days, people have been playing around publicly with OpenAI’s newest available advancement, a text-generating language model that at its best can be difficult to distinguish as non-human.</p>



<p>Since I do not have access to the beta version where people are playing around with the technology, the closest I have been able to interact with it was through McKay Wrigley’s now temporarily defunct website, <em><a href="https://learnfromanyone.com/">learnfromanyone.com</a></em>. I am not sure how exactly he built it or in what ways it may or may not be differentiated from the GPT-3 beta on its own. They seem largely the same and it is clear that the GPT-3 AI is the thing doing most of the work. One key difference is that while people apparently engage directly with the AI via the beta, on McKay’s website they instead write in a “teacher” to engage with and a question or statement to begin the back and forth.</p>



<p>I played around with this for a few hours before the website went down and had many failed or broken conversations. I suspect these may have been errors stemming from the few things layered on top of the AI for this website rather than from the AI itself, but I cannot be sure. Nonetheless, I did have several very interesting dialogues with “teachers” whom I thought it would be interesting to converse with. </p>



<p>Below are some screenshots from one of the dialogues that I had, this one with Socrates. The only writing that I did are the pieces written directly after “Me:”. This does not include two pieces that came up after the text after “Me:” and before Socrates’ response but which were not written by me. Those two pieces are the ones beginning with “(This is a list of” and “You are aware of”. The last thing I should mention is that in the dozens of dialogues that I had on this website, none of the others had the pattern you will see where the responses from the teacher (in this case, Socrates) were supplemented by additional text in parentheses. With that introduction, you have about as much context as I do to understand what is going on with the dialogue below, so I will leave it up to you to interpret for yourself. All I will say is that it certainly seems interesting and it feels like a technology unlike anything I have ever experienced before.</p>

<div>
<p>Worms Armageddon version 3.8 is finally released! It's been a long time coming, and we hope you'll enjoy all the features, changes, and bug fixes that made it into this community-made update. To whet your appetite, here are some change highlights:
</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:ESOButton2.png"><img alt="ESOButton2.png" src="https://worms2d.info/images/0/04/ESOButton2.png" width="146" height="82"></a></p></div></div>
<h3><span id="Extended_Scheme_Options">Extended Scheme Options</span></h3>
<p>Customise your matches in weird and wonderful ways with over 70 new scheme options. Manipulate physics, fire more than one weapon in a turn, have worms bounce around the landscape, or choose from a huge array of other tweaks in order to perfect your scheme. These options are only for the seasoned Worms veteran, and as such you will need to have completed the Single Player mode and unlocked The Full Wormage in order to access them.</p>
<br><center><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:ESO1.gif" title="inline"><img alt="inline" src="https://worms2d.info/images/9/91/ESO1.gif" width="180" height="180"></a> <a href="https://worms2d.info/File:ESO2.gif" title="inline"><img alt="inline" src="https://worms2d.info/images/d/df/ESO2.gif" width="180" height="180"></a> <a href="https://worms2d.info/File:ESO3.gif" title="inline"><img alt="inline" src="https://worms2d.info/images/5/59/ESO3.gif" width="180" height="180"></a> <a href="https://worms2d.info/File:ESO4.gif" title="inline"><img alt="inline" src="https://worms2d.info/images/4/45/ESO4.gif" width="180" height="180"></a></center>
<p>For those who used the RubberWorm module in older versions of the game, all features formerly accessed through that module are now hiding behind the shiny new Extended Scheme Options star button. Relive your past glories — all your old RubberWorm recorded games can be played back with no additional software required.
</p>

<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:Tweening.gif"><img alt="" src="https://worms2d.info/images/5/53/Tweening.gif" width="300" height="240"></a></p><div><p>Demonstration of Tweening</p></div></div></div>
<h3><span id="Tweening">Tweening</span></h3>
<p>Worms Armageddon has never looked this smooth! In older versions, in-game movement and animations would be capped at the update rate of the game engine: 50 frames per second. In 3.8 though, experience the full silky smoothness of whatever frame rate your hardware can support — movement is now visually interpolated between game engine frames as your worms and weapons glide majestically through the air. Watch a recorded game in slow motion and you'll never want to go back!</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:Window.png"><img alt="" src="https://worms2d.info/images/d/dc/Window.png" width="300" height="237"></a></p><div><p>Demonstration of windowed mode</p></div></div></div>
<h3><span id="Windowed_Mode">Windowed Mode</span></h3>
<p>Worms Armageddon can now be played in a window! Awkward screen resolution changes and game capture issues are a thing of the past if you enable this feature in Advanced Settings.</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:Streaming-mode.png"><img alt="" src="https://worms2d.info/images/6/66/Streaming-mode.png" width="211" height="85"></a></p><div><p>Demonstration of Streaming Mode IP address hiding</p></div></div></div>
<h3><span id="Streamers.27_Heaven">Streamers' Heaven</span></h3>
<p>Along with Windowed Mode, a couple of additional options have been added specifically for streamers to make their lives easier. Audio can now be allowed to continue playing when the game window loses focus, and the new Streaming Mode will prevent IP addresses from being displayed when hosting or joining an online game (see the Update Documentation for more information).</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:Cpu-teams.png"><img alt="" src="https://worms2d.info/images/4/4d/Cpu-teams.png" width="252" height="151"></a></p><div><p>Demonstration of CPU teams being added to an online game</p></div></div></div>
<h3><span id="CPU_Teams_at_Large">CPU Teams at Large</span></h3>
<p>CPU teams can now be added to online games. They're always uniquely distinguishable from player teams to prevent shenanigans, but you can now finally team up with your friends to take down a swarm of those computer-controlled invertebrates. Or if you'd just like to watch a relaxing game while you work, matches containing only CPU teams may now also be started, both online and offline.</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:Smapshot.png"><img alt="" src="https://worms2d.info/images/7/71/Smapshot.png" width="300" height="225"></a></p></div></div>
<h3><span id="Mapshot">Mapshot</span></h3>
<p>Have you ever wrought a beautiful trail of destruction on your Worms Armageddon landscape and wished you could play a brand new game on the land that remained? Or have you ever been interrupted in the middle of a game and wished you could extract the remaining landscape to help you set up a rematch? Well, now you can! Simply type <b>/map</b> into the in-game chat or press <b>Alt + Pause</b> at any time to save a snapshot of the current state of the map, allowing you to continue your rampage from where you left off!</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:Wa95-2.png"><img alt="" src="https://worms2d.info/images/a/a0/Wa95-2.png" width="300" height="225"></a></p><div><p>Worms Armageddon running in Windows 95 (on real hardware!)</p></div></div></div>
<h3><span id="Compatibility">Compatibility</span></h3>
<p>Much effort has been expended in allowing everyone, no matter their hardware, to have a good Worms Armageddon experience. Further tweaks have been made to improve the experience of Windows 10 users. Worms Armageddon now runs well under Wine or Proton on Linux. A new OpenGL renderer has been added which, depending on your hardware, might outperform the other renderers. Windowed mode means there's no more need for your hardware to support specific screen resolutions. And for those into retro computing, Worms Armageddon has been seen to once again run on systems of yore...</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://worms2d.info/File:Languages.png"><img alt="" src="https://worms2d.info/images/b/b5/Languages.png" width="222" height="120"></a></p><div><p>Sample of languages supported by Worms Armageddon's volunteer translators</p></div></div></div>
<h3><span id="Translations">Translations</span></h3>
<p>Through the tireless efforts of volunteer translators, Worms Armageddon is now fully translated to seven languages (🇫🇮 Finnish, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹🇧🇷 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇪🇸 Spanish and 🇸🇪 Swedish), with four more languages with partial translations on the way. The Update Documentation (Readme) now has translations to Finnish, French, and Spanish!</p>

<p>I’m tired of note-taking apps. </p>



<p>It’s not because of limited choices. But it’s the other way around. There are so many note-taking apps you could try but end up sticking to none. At least, that’s my story. It’s a perfect example of&nbsp;<strong>the paradox of choice.</strong></p>



<p>I used to wonder why people keep building so many ‘note-taking’ apps when the market is already crowded with choices. Then I figured a few reasons why.</p>



<ul><li><strong>the market size</strong>: the global <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/note-making-management-software-market/#:~:text=According%20to%20Verified%20Market%20Research,5.32%25%20from%202019%20to%202026." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">note-taking management software market</a> is estimated to reach&nbsp;<strong>$1.35 billion </strong>by<strong> 2026</strong>, growing at a&nbsp;<strong>CAGR </strong>of<strong> 5.32% </strong>from<strong> 2019 to 2026</strong></li><li><strong>greater scope for innovation:&nbsp;</strong>eg., be it creating a task list, a roadmap, or a design repository, Notion can handle it all</li><li><strong>lack of satisfaction:&nbsp;</strong>it’s noted that people always use a combination of note-taking apps and hardly stick to one for a long time</li></ul>



<p>Despite such heavy competition, apps like Notion, Google Keep, OneNote, Evernote, etc. have managed to earn a place. People use these apps for</p>



<ul><li>the ecosystem. eg., Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote</li><li>the neat user experience., eg. Bear etc.</li><li>creating a disciplined way of taking notes. eg., Notion, Roam Research</li></ul>



<p>I’ve tried them all. But none of these apps have turned me into a ‘<strong>repeat user</strong>.’ </p>



<p>After battling with so many apps only to feel guilty for not having the discipline to consistently use them, I’ve finally resorted to the most personal and easy alternative ⁠—&nbsp;<strong>writing things down</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m familiar with writing in a notebook since my childhood. It’s not new to me, and it absolutely doesn’t require any learning curve.</p>



<h3>The reasons why I find writing things down useful</h3>



<ul><li>absolute focus and the ability to think through the points I’m writing</li><li>gives a chance to remember what I’m writing</li><li>no way to copy-paste stuff as it is, and that means taking notes in a way I understand</li><li>easy to switch between formats eg., flowchart, mind map, Venn diagram, etc</li><li>helps me stay in touch with my handwriting</li></ul>



<p>Of course, everything has its downsides, and writing things down is no exception here. <br>For example, I will not be able to</p>



<ul><li>add screenshots/images, links, etc</li><li>easily search for content as there’s no ‘search bar’</li></ul>



<p>And maybe there’s more to the list I’m not talking about. </p>



<p>All I can say for sure is, based on my usage behavior, I’m okay missing out on these features. I can always save links to <a href="https://app.getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket</a> for future reference, and take pictures of my notes to share with friends.</p>



<p>So if you ask me if I’d try a beautiful, innovative note-taking app that’s much better than the apps I’ve used so far, my answer is,&nbsp;<em>“<strong>Why not</strong>! <strong>I’d definitely give it a shot</strong></em>.”</p>



<p>But my greatest worry is if I’d continue using it.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>If my opinion on note-taking apps changes over time, I’d be happy to update this post with a “And the hero finally arrived!” heading to talk about the app that helped change my mind. 🤡</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-main"><div><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div><p>With continuous content publishing, you fully automate your publication workflows, so you don't need to push a Deploy button or run a <code>deploy</code> command. For this to work, you need to set up a continuous deployment pipeline, which builds and releases code automatically, without human intervention.</p><h2 id="building-blocks">Building Blocks</h2><p>The final goal of this automation is that a content change, such as modifying a post, will automatically show up on your CDN deployed site. Before setting up a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline, let's talk about the building blocks involved. </p><figure><div></div></figure><h3 id="data-source">Data Source</h3><p>Jamify sites currently only use one data source: a headless Ghost CMS. It's important that your Ghost CMS is hosted on a publicly available domain. A local install is not sufficient, because inline images are still served from your CMS. </p><blockquote>Jamify is working to lift this requirement, so it will become possible to run your headless Ghost CMS locally or on a private network.</blockquote><p>If you want to know how you can run a headless Ghost CMS on your own public cloud server, check out the tutorial on installing a <a href="https://www.jamify.org/2020/04/07/ghost-cms-on-hetzner-cloud/">Ghost CMS on Hetzner Cloud</a>.</p><p>No matter where you run your CMS, first thing you should do is activate headless mode in Ghost Admin. Switch on the <em>Make this site private </em>option under General Settings:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p>This is really important, so search engines don't get confused about the official source of you content. If this option is not set correctly, your SEO gets impacted negatively.</p><h3 id="build-process">Build Process</h3><p>The build process is the crucial step in the chain. It's responsible for making your site secure and flaring fast by design. It's also the computationally most demanding step and will govern the pipeline propagation time: how fast a content change shows up on the live page.</p><p>There are two different kind of changes that require you to re-build your Jamify site: content updates and configuration updates. Content updates are usually more frequent than configuration updates, so the workflow should optimize content updates if possible.</p><p>For use in a CD pipeline, the build process must also run on a public server or cloud service. Cost, speed and availability are the main factors that you need to take into account when deciding for a build service.</p><h3 id="static-assets">Static Assets</h3><p>The outcome of the build process are your static assets, which are typically placed in the <code>public/</code> folder. In a CD setup, this folder does not reside in your public repository. The build process usually makes a local copy of your repository and places the assets there.</p><p>It's worth noting that the notion of <em>static</em> has changed substantially during the last years. That's why Gatsby changed it's wording from a static site builder to <em>building blazing fast </em><strong><em>websites</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>apps</em></strong>. Today's static websites are dynamic as apps and if you are using Jamify you have already seen that in action: when integrating a contact page, a commenting system or a table of contents side pane.</p><h3 id="content-delivery-network-cdn-">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3><p>The last building block is the deploy step, where you copy your static assets over to a CDN provider who then distributes your content and sets your website live. Hosting static assets is much cheaper than hosting dynamic websites, but the most important benefit of a CDN are security and speed.</p><p>If you are building sites with Jamify, there is no excuse not to publish a production website to a CDN. Common options are Netlify, AWS, fastly, firebase and google storage.</p><h2 id="wire-up-the-pipeline">Wire up the pipeline</h2><p>Now that you have a good conceptional understanding of the basic building blocks involved, it's time to wire them up with a CD pipeline. In this guide, I'm going to demonstrate one possible workflow that has proven to be robust and cost-efficient. </p><p>However, I want to stress that I'm not affiliated with any of the companies mentioned in this guide and I will always try to hint at alternatives. </p><blockquote>Jamify wants to enable you to publish flaring fast blogs. We strongly believe that this goal can only be achieved by staying open to all available options.</blockquote><h3 id="setting-up-a-git-repository">Setting up a Git repository</h3><p>The central point where all your wires connect is where your Jamify code resides: a git repository. As the Jamify starter is hosted on Github, the following example is also done with <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. If you prefer Gitlab or Bitbucket, I'm sure it's easy to adapt the steps to these code hubs as well. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> is an interesting option, if you want to self-host your repository.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-starter-try-ghost">Jamify starter</a> has been template enabled which means that you can make a direct copy of the starter into your own Github account.</p><blockquote>You can also use a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-forks">fork</a> instead of a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template">template</a>. We recommend forks if you want to make modifications to the code with the intend to issue PRs and templates if you need a plain copy for setting up CD pipelines. </blockquote><p>After you logged on to your Github account simply click on <a href="https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-starter-try-ghost/generate"><em>Use this template</em></a> to start the copying process. For this example, I use <code>jamify-continuous-publishing</code> for the repository name and a text describing the purpose of this repo:</p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>After clicking <em>Create repository from template </em>you should see a new repository with the given name showing up in your Github account.</p><h3 id="setting-up-the-build-process">Setting up the Build process</h3><p>The build process is most crucial in terms of pipeline speed and also may incur considerable costs as it is an computationally expensive task. If you do not have more than 25 builds a day, the free tiers of <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/pricing/">Gatsby Cloud</a> should all make you happy.</p><p>For this tutorial I pick the newcomer <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby Cloud</a>, who announced their <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-27-announcing-gatsby-builds-and-reports/">build service</a> just recently. While their free tier is generous, the first paid plan is starting steeply at $99/month. </p><p>Unless you really need their stunning incremental build feature, you are better off with Netlify or Github Actions, provided you hit the 25 build/day mark. Of the three, only Github Actions has a pricing model based on actually used runner minutes, which is favourable in most circumstance, especially with highly varying loads.</p><p>Let's start setting up the build process with Gatsby Cloud. Login into your account and click on <em>Create a new site </em>and choose <em>I already have a Gatsby site:</em></p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>After pressing <em>Next</em>, click on <em>Select an organization</em> which brings you to your Github account. I prefer to give Gatsby only access rights to specific repositories, in this case to <code>jamify-continuous-publishing</code>:</p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>You can leave the default values for <code>branch</code> and <code>base directory</code>. <strong>Skip the integration step</strong> as it is not needed here.</p><p>Be attentive to the setup step. <strong>Now you connect your Jamify starter with your own content source.</strong> This is the place where you enter your headless Ghost API url and key. A new key can be generated in Ghost Admin under <em>Integrations</em>, by pressing <em>Add custom integration</em>.</p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><blockquote>In the <a href="https://www.jamify.org/2020/05/19/getting-started-with-jamify/">Getting Started</a> tutorial we used a <code>.ghost.json</code> file for the &nbsp; Ghost API keys. This was fine for a local repository. When you connect the starter to cloud service, using environment variables is more flexible and secure.</blockquote><p>When you press <em>Create site </em>a new build is automatically triggered on Gatsby Cloud.</p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>On build completion you can view your site on the cryptic domain <code>build-*.gtsb.io</code>.</p><h3 id="triggering-builds-on-configuration-changes">Triggering builds on configuration changes</h3><p>Due to the connection you made between Gatsby Cloud and your Github repository, a build is already automatically triggered whenever you make configuration changes to your repository code in <code>jamify-continuous-publishing</code> for this example. To see that in action, clone the repository locally:</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>git</span> clone https://github.com/styxlab/jamify-continuous-publishing.git
$ <span>cd</span> jamify-continuous-publishing</code></pre></div><p>Let's make a simple configuration change, by removing dark mode from <code>gatsby-config.js</code>. Comment out all lines that belong to the plugin <code>gatsby-theme-ghost-dark-mode</code>:</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
plugins<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        resolve<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-theme-try-ghost</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>

<span>]</span>    </code></pre></div><p>Stage and commit these changes:</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>jamify-continuous-publishing<span>]</span>$ <span>git</span> <span>add</span> <span>.</span>
<span>[</span>jamify-continuous-publishing<span>]</span>$ <span>git</span> commit -m <span>"remove dark-mode"</span>
<span>[</span>jamify-continuous-publishing<span>]</span>$ <span>git</span> push</code></pre></div><p>The push immediately triggers a re-build on Gatsby Cloud.</p><h3 id="triggering-builds-on-content-changes">Triggering builds on content changes</h3><p>To automatically trigger builds on content changes, you need a way to initiate news builds without making code changes to your repository. This can be done with webhooks. A webhook is an endpoint to which you send a <code>POST</code> request. This request triggers an action, in our case a re-build.</p><p>Gatsby Cloud provides two webhooks, one for <code>Preview</code> and one for <code>Production</code>. Only the <code>Production</code> build can be connected to a CDN, so we use the <code>Builds Webhook</code> here:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p>This webhook must be connection with an action in your headless Ghost CMS. In your Ghost Admin panel go to <em>Integrations </em>and click on<em> Add a new custom integration.</em></p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>Fill out the the name with <code>gatsby-cloud-builds</code> and give it a description, e.g. <em>Add webhooks for continuous deployment builds</em>. Next, add a new webook with event <code>Site changed (rebuild)</code> and copy/paste the production webhook URL from Gatsby Cloud into the target field. Creating and saving these settings activates this connection between CMS content changes and Gatsby Cloud builds.</p><p>Let's make a content change and see, if a build is automatically triggered. Here I change <code>Gatsby</code> to <code>Gatsby Builds</code> and press <code>Update</code>:</p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>You should see a new build process triggered immediately, with the notification: <em>Triggered by Gatsby Build webhook</em>. Open your site on <code>gtsb.io</code> to verify that the changes show up on your website.</p><figure><div><div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="deploy-to-cdn">Deploy to CDN</h2><p>A CDN is a globally distributed group of servers that store static content.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>What is the most common way to create an object of a class? Yeah, you probably guessed it right! By using a constructor. But is it always the best way? We’ll find out here!</p>
<p>Another way to create objects of a class is by using a public static factory method. This method creates an instance of a class and then returns it.  Providing a static method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most important advantage  of using a static factory method is that it can have a proper name. You don’t have to check the documentation every time to know what is the constructor you should use if you need a particular type of object. Consider the example <code>BigInteger</code> constructor <code>BigInteger(int, int, Random)</code>  which is expected to return a prime number. This could be better expressed by using a function name <code>createProbablePrime</code>.  A class can have only one constructor with a particular signature. Programmers tend to have a workaround where the order of parameters is different for constructors that behave differently. This is a bad practice since the caller class might call the  wrong constructor when there are multiple such permutations of the same set of parameters.</li>
<li>Another advantage of using static factory methods is that they can cache the objects once created and need not create a new object every single time they are invoked like a constructor. This practice often improves the performance and makes the program light weight to run. This is generally used when dealing with classes where the object creation is a costly affair.</li>
<li>Static factory methods can also return any subtype of their return type. This is something which cannot be achieved by constructors. The return types can also vary as according to the set of parameters provided as input to the factory method which gives great flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us come to the disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the major disadvantages is that the classes that do not have a public or protected constructor cannot be subclassed further. However, this also propagates the idea of preferring composition over inheritance which is considered a good practice.</li>
<li>Another disadvantage of considering static factory methods is that they are hard to find for the programmer. This can be avoided by using proper naming conventions like <code>getInstance()</code>,  <code>valueOf()</code> etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time for some code probably?</p>
<p>Consider the Student class given below:</p>
<pre><code>public class Student {
    
    private final String name;
    private final String branch;
    private final String yearOfStudy;
    
    public User(String name, String branch, String yearOfStudy) {
        this.name = name;
        this.branch = branch;
        this.yearOfStudy = yearOfStudy;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you take a first look there is nothing wrong with the constructor. But when a student takes admission into a university we would want the the <code>yearOfStudy</code> to be set as <code>First</code>, wouldn’t we? Now this is where the static factory method comes to your rescue.</p>
<pre><code>public static Student createFreshmanStudent(String name, String branch) {
    return new Student(name, branch, "First");
}
</code></pre>
<p>And we can create an object of the <code>Student</code> by using the code below,</p>
<p><code>Student student = Student.createFreshmanStudent(“John Doe”, “Computer Science”);</code></p>
<p>That will be all folks! Until the next time :)</p>

<p>Is it unfair your team is constantly called for weekend work?<br>Are your team members complaining that they have no social life anymore?<br>Are they threatening to leave if something does not change?</p>



<p>The good news is, there are many scenarios where you can reduce or remove the need for your team in their downtime. First, you need to understand why you team is being called for weekend work. Let’s go through a few reasons and how we might prevent them from happening.</p>



<h2>Reasons For Weekend Work</h2>



<h3>Site Outages</h3>



<p>A Class A, highest priority ticket has come in on Friday evening as everyone is preparing to leave – a customer’s site has crashed. Your team must drop everything (including their social plans) to get online and come up with a solution.</p>



<p>After working all night Friday and half of Saturday, your team puts in a fix and calls it a day. But they are not happy – their weekend with their family and friends has been cancelled, and they wonder if the job is worth these weekend calls.</p>



<h4>Prevent Site Outages</h4>



<p>After the issue has been resolved, take a whiteboard or pen and paper and answer these questions.</p>



<ul><li>What did the user experience? For example, did they receive an alarm, get a 500 response error, etc.?</li><li>Why did the site go down?</li><li>Did something like this happen before?</li><li>Who was involved / what expertise was required?</li><li>How can we prevent this from happening ever again?</li></ul>



<p>Once you have these answered, put a plan in place to mitigate this issue happening ever again. Sometimes, it can be as simple as adding a new test case. Other times it may be more complicated and involve setting up new test environments. Look at the cost/reward of fixing it going forward and make a decision.</p>



<h3>Late Release Work</h3>



<p>The release deadline fast approaches. There is only a few days left until the software is released. Everything is late, and your team are under pressure to deliver.</p>



<p>One of the tasks your team was working on is blocked because the environment was down the past two days. Now the environment is up, but management has requested the task be worked on over the weekend and completed by Monday morning.</p>



<h4>Prevent Late Release Work</h4>



<p>All teams understand the pressure of having features that are late and in danger of not making the deadline.<br>To prevent late delivery of features, here are a list of DON’Ts you can apply.</p>



<ul><li>Don’t underestimate the work. Always take your final estimate and add an extra 20% onto it.</li><li>Don’t plan optimistically. Assume that things will go wrong, other teams will be late, code will break. In Ireland, there is a phrase “It’ll be grand”, meaning that everything will work itself out. It won’t be grand. Nothing will work itself out. Plan accordingly.</li><li>Don’t promise delivery dates that are not feasible. Pressure from management may tempt you to do this. Do not give in. Have data to backup your claims.</li><li>Don’t promise delivery dates without doing your homework and gathering as much data as possible. List out as many tasks as possible and estimate each of them. What are your risks? How could your risks affect the delivery date? Are the risks low, medium or high?</li><li>Don’t hide problems from your manager during the release. Is a task going to be late? Tell your manager asap and show what you are doing to mitigate it.</li></ul>



<p>An experienced team lead will have this list off by heart without even realising it. Have you got more Don’ts you have learned the hard way? Comment them below.</p>



<h3>Late Sprint Work</h3>



<p>This depends on your team. There are teams that are not strict on their sprint commitments, and there are other teams which require themselves to work weekends if the work is not ready to deliver.</p>



<h4>Prevent Late Sprint Work</h4>



<p>Late sprint work usually comes down to poor sprint planning in the first place.</p>



<ul><li>Did your sprint planning cover this task sufficiently?</li><li>Why did the team underestimate this task in their planning?</li><li>What can you take from this going forward to ensure future similar tasks are estimated more accurately?</li></ul>



<p>Effective sprint planning is difficult, but is worth it to get the team in the habit of delivering their committed work.</p>



<h3>Supporting Other Teams</h3>



<p>If you are leading a high performing team, then more than likely you will have at least one or more persons who act as experts or specialists in a particular area. This is great for your team…most of the time.</p>



<p>A downside of being an expert is you get called up for consultation on things you were not even involved in. You could be called into an escalation because another team is behind in their commitments. I have often seen specialists called into very tricky situations like performance test failures, where an application is failing at scale and nobody knows why. Scenarios like this are dangerous for experts, because it could bleed your evening and weekends dry.</p>



<h4>Prevent Supporting Other Teams</h4>



<p>The title here seems unprofessional. Experts are there to act as experts, right? </p>



<p>This may be true, but the fact is that even experts don’t like getting called on a Friday evening or Saturday morning and asked to go online. As the team lead, it is your job to protect your team as much as possible in their downtime, so that they can focus more effectively during working hours.</p>



<p>There is a host of reasons your team expert could be called into work unexpectedly. Work with your team to brainstorm how to reduce the need for being called to unplanned work. Here are some suggestions.</p>



<ul><li>Train a member from the other team in some debugging techniques for the particular area of expertise.</li><li>Document troubleshooting procedures for various scenarios. Share this document with the organisation.</li><li>If a call comes in, brainstorm some possible solutions for the caller to explore. There may not be a need for you to be online. Give enough information that they can proceed with troubleshooting.</li></ul>



<p>As the team lead, your goal is to keep everyone happy as much as possible. Can you prevent the team from being called in the first place by preparing in advance during working hours? Discuss the above with the experts in your team and get a plan together to protect their weekends.</p>



<h2>Dealing With Necessary Weekend Work</h2>



<p>Sometimes weekend work is absolutely necessary – there is no way around it. That bug isn’t fixing itself and the release date isn’t moving, so your team is left with no choice.</p>



<p>Now your job as team lead is to reduce the team’s pain as much as possible. Here are some suggestions for reducing this pain.</p>



<ul><li>Instead of John working Saturday and Sunday, can John work Saturday and Jess work Sunday?</li><li>Challenge the work that is requested. Can some part of it can be investigated on Monday instead of now?</li><li>Develop a rota for the next 4-8 weekends so that your team can plan in advance that they might need to be online. This will also prevent last minute requests to your team members and ruining their weekend plans.</li><li>Is there a support team that could take some of the requested work? In my case, I discovered a ‘secret’ team that were setup specifically to support internal stakeholder escalations, yet my team had been supporting these cases for the past few months. Nowadays, any time an internal stakeholder asks my team directly for support, I forward their email to the dedicated support team. They’re happy, I’m happy, and my team are none the wiser that I have protected their evening and weekend.</li><li>Work smart, not hard. Most likely, your team do not need to be online 24/7. If so, propose time slots that your team will be online to check emails and answer requests. For example, when my team are asked to be online over the weekend ‘just in case’ something goes wrong, I insist that we give a list of times where we will be online and contactable. In general, the time slots are 10-11am and 3-4pm. Outside of these times, my team can relax and go about their day.</li></ul>



<p>If all else fails and someone has to be online to support a problem, make sure they are not working alone. Any work is painful when it is done alone, and weekend work it is 10 times worse. It may be you that needs to make the sacrifice and go online to brainstorm ideas and support in the troubleshooting. They will be secretly grateful for your company, and won’t feel the weight of the world on their shoulders.</p>

<![CDATA[Inheritance in C using structure composition]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>C language does not support inheritance however it does support Structure Compositions which can be tweaked to serve use-cases requiring parent-child relationships. In this article, we find out how Structure Compositions help us emulate inheritance in C and keep our code extensible. We will also find how it powers two of the most important things to have ever been invented in the field of computer science.</p>

<p>Structure Composition is when we put one structure within another, not through its pointer but as a native member - something like this</p>
<pre><code>


<span><span>struct</span> <span>list_head</span> {</span>
	<span><span>struct</span> <span>list_head</span> *<span>next</span>;</span> 
	<span><span>struct</span> <span>list_head</span> *<span>prev</span>;</span> 
};


<span><span>struct</span> <span>list_int</span> {</span>
	<span><span>struct</span> <span>list_head</span> <span>list</span>;</span>  
	<span>int</span> value;              
};


<span><span>struct</span> <span>list_str</span> {</span>
	<span><span>struct</span> <span>list_head</span> <span>list</span>;</span>  
	<span>char</span> * str;             
};
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we define a node of a linked list using structure composition. Usually, a linked list node has 3 members - two pointers to adjacent nodes (next and previous) and a third one could either be the data or a pointer to it.  The defining factor of a linked list is the two pointers that logically form a chain of nodes. To keep things abstract we create a struct named <code>list_head</code> which holds these two pointers  <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> and omits the specifics i.e. data.</p>
<p>Using <code>list_head</code> structure, if we were to define a node of a linked list holding an integer value we could create another struct, named <code>list_int</code> that holds a member of type <code>list_head</code> and an integer value <code>value</code>. The next and previous pointers are brought into this struct through <code>list_head list</code> and could be referred to as <code>list.next</code> and <code>list.prev</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a very genuine reason for picking such weird names for a linked list node and members of structures; the reason to do so will be cleared in the later sections of this essay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of the above structure definition, building a linked list node holding of any type becomes a breeze. For example, a node holding string could be quickly defined as a struct <code>list_str</code> having <code>list_head</code> and a <code>char *</code>. This ability to extend <code>list_head</code> and build a node holding data of any type and any specifics make low-level code simple, uniform, and extensible.</p>
<h2>Memory Representation of <code>list_int</code></h2>
<p>Structures in C are not padded and they do not even hold any meta information, not even for the member names; hence during allocation, they are allocated the space just enough to hold the actual data.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/83953834-694a6a00-a861-11ea-8ff7-fa69af6af7d6.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/83953834-694a6a00-a861-11ea-8ff7-fa69af6af7d6.png"></p>
<p>In the illustration above we see how members of <code>list_int</code> are mapped on the allocated space - required by its individual members. It is allocated a contiguous space of 12 bytes - 4 bytes for each of the two pointers and another 4 bytes for the integer value. The contiguity of space allocation and order of members during allocation could be verified by printing out their addresses as shown below.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>print_addrs</span><span>()</span> </span>{
    
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>list_int</span> *<span>ll</span> = <span>new_list_int</span>(41434);</span>

    
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%p: head\n"</span>,             head);
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%p: head-&gt;list.next\n"</span>,  &amp;((head-&gt;<span>list</span>).next));
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%p: head-&gt;list.prev\n"</span>,  &amp;((head-&gt;<span>list</span>).prev));
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%p: head-&gt;value\n"</span>,      &amp;(head-&gt;value));
}

~ $ make &amp;&amp; ./a.out
<span>0x4058f0</span>: head
<span>0x4058f0</span>: head-&gt;<span>list</span>.next
<span>0x4058f4</span>: head-&gt;<span>list</span>.prev
<span>0x4058f8</span>: head-&gt;value
</code></pre>
<p>We clearly see all the 3 members, occupying 12 bytes contiguous memory segments in order of their definition within the struct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The above code was executed on a machine where the size of integer and pointers were 4 bytes each. The results might differ depending on the machine and CPU architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Casting pointers pointing to struct</h2>
<p>In C language, when a pointer to a struct is cast to a pointer to another struct, the engine maps the individual members of a target struct type, depending on their order and offsets, on to the slice of memory of the source struct instance.</p>
<p>When we cast <code>list_int *</code> into <code>list_head *</code>, the engine maps the space required by target type i.e. <code>list_head</code> on space occupied by <code>list_int</code>. This means it maps the 8 bytes required by <code>list_head</code> on the first 8 bytes occupied by <code>list_int</code> instance. Going by the memory representation discussed above, we find that the first 8 bytes of <code>list_int</code> are in fact <code>list_head</code>, and hence casting <code>list_int *</code> to <code>list_head *</code> is effectively just referencing the <code>list_head</code> member of <code>list_int</code> through a new variable.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/83943610-2e254800-a81b-11ea-8b25-056e1b1df85e.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/83943610-2e254800-a81b-11ea-8b25-056e1b1df85e.png"></p>
<p>This effectively builds a parent-child relationship between the two structs where we can safely typecast a child <code>list_int</code> to its parent <code>list_head</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to note here that the parent-child relationship is established only because the first member of <code>list_int</code> is of type <code>list_head</code>. it would not have worked if we change the order of members in <code>list_int</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As established above, by putting one struct within another as its first element we are effectively creating a parent-child relationship between the two. Since this gives us an ability to safely typecast child to its parent we can define functions that accept a pointer to parent struct as an argument and perform operations that do not really require to deal with specifics. This allows us to <strong>NOT</strong> rewrite the functional logic for every child extensions and thus avoid redundant code.</p>
<p>From the context we have set up, say we want to write a function that adds a node between the two in a linked list. The core logic to perform this operation does not really need to deal with any specifics all it takes is a few pointer manipulations of <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code>. Hence, we could just define the function accepting arguments of type <code>list_head *</code>  and write the function as</p>
<pre><code>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> __list_add(struct list_head *<span>new</span>,
                       struct list_head *prev,
                       struct list_head *next)
{
    next-&gt;prev = <span>new</span>;
    <span>new</span>-&gt;next = next;
    <span>new</span>-&gt;prev = prev;
    prev-&gt;next = <span>new</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since we can safely typecase <code>list_int *</code> and <code>list_str *</code> to <code>list_head *</code> we can pass any of the specific implementations the function <code>__list_add</code> and it would still add the node between the other two seamlessly.</p>
<p>Since the core operations on linked lists only require pointer manipulations, we can define these operations as functions accepting <code>list_head *</code> instead of specific types like <code>list_int *</code>.  Thus we need not write similar functions for specifics. A function to delete a node could be written as</p>
<pre><code>
<span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>void</span> __list_del(struct list_head * prev, struct list_head * next)
{
    next-&gt;prev = prev;
    prev-&gt;next = next;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Other linked list utilities like <em>adding a node to tail</em>, <em>swapping nodes</em>, <em>splicing the list</em>, <em>rotating the list</em>, etc only require manipulations of <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers. Hence they could also be written in a very similar way i.e accepting <code>list_head *</code> and thus eliminating the need to reimplement function logic for every single child implementation.</p>
<p>This behavior is very similar to how inheritance in modern OOP languages, like Python and Java, work where the child is allowed to invoke any parent function.</p>

<p>There are a ton of practical usage of using Structure Compositions but the most famous ones are</p>
<h2>Linux Kernel</h2>
<p>In order to keep things abstract and extensible, Linux Kernel uses Structure Composition at several places. One of the most important places where it uses composition is for managing and maintaining Linked Lists, exactly how we saw things above. The struct definitions and code snippets are taken as-is from the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/list.h">Kernel's source code</a>, and hence the structure and variable names look different than usual.</p>
<h2>Python Type and Object Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Python, one of the most important languages in today's world, uses Structure Composition to build Type Hierarchy. Python defines a root structure called <code>PyObject</code> which holds reference count, defining the number of places from which the object is referenced - and object type - determining the type of the object i.e. <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>, etc.</p>
<pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span><span>struct</span> _<span>object</span> {</span>
    Py_ssize_t     ob_refcnt;  
    PyTypeObject   *ob_type;   
} PyObject;
</code></pre>
<p>Since Python wants these fields to be present in every single object that is created during runtime, it uses structure composition to ensure that objects like integers, floats, string, etc put <code>PyObject</code> as their first element and thus establishing a parent-child relationship. A Float object in Python is defined as</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>define</span> PyObject_HEAD PyObject ob_base;</span>

<span>typedef</span> <span><span>struct</span> {</span>
    PyObject_HEAD
    <span>double</span> ob_fval;    
} PyFloatObject;
</code></pre>
<p>Now writing utility functions that increments and decrements references count on every access of any object could be written as just a single function accepting <code>PyObject *</code> as shown below</p>
<pre><code><span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>void</span> _Py_INCREF(PyObject *op) {
    op-&gt;ob_refcnt++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thus we eradicate a need of rewriting <code>INCREF</code> for every single object type and just write it once for <code>PyObject</code> and it will work for every single Python object type that is extended through <code>PyObject</code>.</p>

<p>GNU/LINUX is popular amongst paranoid types due to the audit-able nature of its codebase (or at least most of it).</p>

<p>Many, however, are ultimately misled into thinking that mainstream distributions of GNU/Linux are more secure than windows out of the box. If you scrutinize a newly installed machine, you will find that this is not the case. In fact, almost all distributions start off without a host firewall: That means the machine is open to all incoming connections within its network!</p>

<p>Linux machines are generally unsecured by default. On first boot, most distros do not even have firewalls running by default: they are open to the world. This ultimately implies that Windows 10 is more hardened out of the box than nearly every GNU/Linux. But if a user is willing to experiment and tinker, a Linux machine can be made to compete with Windows in a serious way. Linux machines are, after all, a prime choice for enterprise servers, but are typically maintained by experienced admins.</p>

<p>I'll lay out a number of tips in this post for how to harden one particular distribution of GNU/Linux: Debian. Debian is maintained by the non-profit <a href="https://www.debian.org/" rel="nofollow">Debian Project</a> (also: http://sejnfjrq6szgca7v.onion/). It is used as the basis for non-privacy oriented distributions like Ubuntu, but also for security and privacy focused distributions such as the ephemeral operating system <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" rel="nofollow">Tails</a>, an anonymizing operating system made to be run as a virtual machine called <a href="https://www.whonix.org/" rel="nofollow">Whonix</a>, etc. There are many more, but I will leave it there.</p>

<p>Debian has one strong benefit: its default software is free software/open sources open license/public. And the software made available via its package manager is verified via a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds" rel="nofollow">reproducible builds</a> which prevent developers from offering compiled software that is different than the source code they release publicly. Nearly every package offered by the Debian project is complied multiple times by multiple people, so that the hashes of each compilation can by referenced against the package maintainers version to verify he/she has not secretly modified the package. The Debian infrastructure has removed as much trust as possible between the user and the developer, and has thus weakened a serious avenue of attack (an attack made all the more real after the Snowden revelations).</p>

<p>I will start by offering a couple guides that are already available elsewhere:</p>

<p><a href="https://anonguide.cyberguerrilla.org/" rel="nofollow">The AnonGuide</a> is one of the best available starting points for a hardened Debian. It walks you through verifying that your Debian installation file is legitimate, directing debian to update over Tor to official Debian .onion servers, use Whonix within a virtual box, harden your kernels network stack, and even use a keyfile when encrypting your hardrive (the keyfile thing is next level paranoid, but losing that keyfile is losing your data).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch-sec-tools.en.html" rel="nofollow">The securing Debian manual</a>, the age shows in this own. Some of its suggested tools no longer exist, and there are more that could be added.</p>

<p>Remember that the goal is to make attacks expensive to carry, not impossible. I am assuming the user is relatively new to using Debian. So many readers will not find this helpful.</p>

<p>Now for my tips:</p>

<ol>
<li> <p>Use disk encryption, particularly with laptops. </p></li>

<p>In the installation of Debian, you will be offer the opportunity tor partition the drive use LVM with disk encryption.</p>

<p>Do so, and utilize a strong passphrase</p>

<li> <p>Put strong passwords on your root user and any sudoer/sudo enabled user</p>

<p>You want to reduce the likelihood of malware being executed by root. An easy way to do so is to make root passwords too strong for malware to guess. </p></li>

<li><p>Create separate users for less trustworthy applications</p></li>

<p>Separate users based on the trustworthiness of applications. Keeping essential files and software away from </p>

<li><p>Start by activating some kind of firewall and setting it to blocking incoming connections. This will allow your machine to initiate connections, but not accept unsolicited.</p></li>

<p>If you're a newbie, try UFW (uncomplicated firewall): </p>

<p><code> sudo apt-get install ufw </code></p>

<p><code> sudo ufw default deny incoming </code></p>

<p>Also (from anondistro):</p>

<p><code> sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules</code></p>

<p><code>LEFT-CTRL+W </code></p>

<p> Now search for "icmp" </p>

<p> Add "#" before each line under "# ok icmp codes" until the line "# allow dhcp client to work" </p>

<p><code> sudo ufw enable </code></p>

<li> <p> Configure Debian to update over TOR with <a href="https://bits.debian.org/2016/08/debian-and-tor-services-available-as-onion-services.html" rel="nofollow">apt-transport tor</a></p> </li>

<p>When Debian fetches software via its package manager, apt, it uses a locally available public key to verify/authenticate the packages it receives to ensure only legitimate software is installed. A bad guy, including one who had taken control of the server you update from, cannot tamper with the software unless he has the private key used to sign the software. The problem is, however, that most servers do not provide any encryption. You can see this when your run apt-get update and see "http://arbitrary-mirrorserver". That means a bad guy can still see what you're installing and utilize that information in an attack. </p>

<p>The Debian project thus responded with quite a leap in privacy by providing the apt-transport-tor utility, which forces apt to anonymize its traffic, then by providing official .onion servers in order to prevent the apt traffic from leaving the tor network. </p>

<p><code> sudo apt-get install apt-transport-tor </code></p>

<p><code> sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list </code></p>

Modify to match the following:

<p><code> deb  tor+http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian          stretch            main </code></p>
<p><code> deb  tor+http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian          stretch-updates    main </code></p>
<p><code> deb  tor+http://sgvtcaew4bxjd7ln.onion/debian-security stretch/updates    main </code></p>

<p> You may add "tor+" to any repo's address you wish. But the traffic will leave the tor network if it is not .onion. </p>

<li> <p> Utilize sandboxing </p> </li>

<p>Sandboxing constrains running programs under default or user written rules. These rules can vary from file and directory access rules to network and window manager rules</p>

<p>Two popular sandboxing solutions on linux are Apparmor and Firejail. Both are easy to use, and are widely available in distros.</p>

<p>You also have the option of installing applications through Flatpak</p>

<p> I have another post on firejailing steam, which can be used as a guide for how to utilize private directories within firejail. A use feature if that application is taking in files and remote code from the outside world.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System#Client%E2%80%93server_separation" rel="nofollow">X11 problem</a>, wherein any application listening on X11 can see anything other applications receive or send through the GUI, can be mitigated by firejail.</p>

<p>Firejail offers a --x11 option that can designate an alternative display server such as xephyr. Adding "--x11=xephyr" will pick up its configuration from /etc/firejail/firejail.conf and open up a strange, unadjustable window on your screen containing the sandboxed software. You will notice that the xephyr window is effectively its own desktop. A window manager can be run within the xephyr X11 sandbox window, meaning the sandboxed programs can be resized within the statically sized xephyr window.</p>

<p>If you read that last paragraph without trying it yourself, you will probably not have understood a word of it. Try it out, and you'll see.</p>

<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.</p>
<p>If there is no common prefix, return an empty string&nbsp;<code>""</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input: </strong>["flower","flow","flight"]
<strong>Output:</strong> "fl"</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input: </strong>["dog","racecar","car"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ""
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no common prefix among the input strings.</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>All given inputs are in lowercase letters&nbsp;<code>a-z</code>.</p>
<h2>The solution in Python</h2>
<pre title="">def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -&gt; str:
    # the return string
    prefix = ''

    # break words into groups using `zip` and `*`
    # ["flower","flow","flight"] becomes:
    # (('f', 'f', 'f'), ('l', 'l', 'l'), ('o', 'o', 'i'), ('w', 'w', 'g'))
    for group in zip(*strs):
        # if the characters don't match, then break
        if not all(char==group[0] for char in group):
            break

        # otherwise, grow the prefix
        prefix += group[0]

    # return the prefix
    return prefix

How does it compare to a slice? How do you declare a map? How do you initialize a map in Go? Fear not, all these questions are answered in this friendly introduction to one of Go’s most powerful features.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang">Golang tutorial</a> series on <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/tag/map">maps</a>. Check out the other posts in the series:</p>

</ul>
<p>Call 'em what you like—hashes, dictionaries, associative arrays, or, in the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang">Go</a> language, <em>maps</em>—this kind of data structure is familiar to every programmer:</p>
<pre><code>{
    'eggs': 1.75,
    'bacon': 3.22,
    'sausage': 1.89,
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-is-a-golang-map-">What is a Golang map?</h2>
<p>The map data type is built in to Go, so we use it a lot. Essentially, it lets us store some <em>value</em> (like the <code>1.75</code> value in the example above) and retrieve it by looking up a <em>key</em> (like <code>eggs</code>).</p>
<p>Why is this useful? Well, another way to store a bunch of related data values would be in a <code>slice</code>:</p>
<pre><code>menu := []float64{1.75, 3.22, 1.89}</code></pre>
<p>This is inconvenient to deal with, because we can only retrieve a value by its <em>index</em> (0, 1, 2, 3, etc), or by looking at every value in turn to see if it's the one we want. And we can't relate the values to other things. For example, which of these values corresponds to the price of eggs? It's impossible to know.</p>
<p>By contrast, a map lets us take one set of things (<code>eggs</code>, <code>bacon</code>, <code>sausage</code>), and set up a one-to-one correspondence (a <em>mapping</em>) with another set of things (1.75, 3.22, 1.89). Much more convenient when we want to look up the price of eggs, for example.</p>
<h2 id="declaring-and-initializing-maps">Declaring and initializing maps</h2>
<p>As usual in Go, we can <em>declare</em> our variable first, and then <em>assign</em> it a value:</p>
<pre><code>var menu map[string]float64
menu = map[string]float64{
    "eggs": 1.75,
    "bacon": 3.22,
    "sausage": 1.89,
}</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, we can use the <em>short declaration syntax</em> to do both operations in one step:</p>
<pre><code>menu := map[string]float64{
    "eggs": 1.75,
    "bacon": 3.22,
    "sausage": 1.89,
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="golang-map-literals">Golang map literals</h2>
<p>The value assigned here is a <em>map literal</em>. It takes the form:</p>
<pre><code>TYPE{
    KEY: VALUE,
    ...
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to declare and initialize a map, it's time to look at <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-types">map types</a>; what are the key and value types of a Go map, and how do we use them?</p>

CI runners can scale to meet demand and can be on standby during core hours to minimize delays.</li><li>Secrets are stored outside of the pipeline and their output is masked, leading to higher security.</li></ul><h3>Pipeline Design Pattern #2: Externalize Logic into Reusable Libraries</h3><p><em>Reusable libraries contain common pipeline logic</em><em> that is</em><em> referenc</em><em>e</em><em>able from pipeline code and </em><em>independently developed and tested.</em></p><div><figure><img src="https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM.png" alt="Externalize Logic into Reusable Libraries" width="242" height="369" srcset="https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM.png 822w, https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM-432x660.png 432w, https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM-768x1173.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" data-srcset="https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM.png 822w, https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM-432x660.png 432w, https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM-768x1173.png 768w" data-src="https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-12.46.15-PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>State of the Art:</p><ul><li>Treat pipeline libraries as any other releasable software.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a practice for managing the reliability of systems that began at Google in the early 2000s. Ben Treynor Sloss from Google started the first SRE team and coined the name. As he puts it in the book&nbsp;<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html">Site Reliability Engineering</a>&nbsp;(published by Google), SRE teams are generally responsible for “the availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their service(s).” That’s a similar list to the responsibilities of many traditional Operations teams.</p><p>SRE was initially a Google innovation, but it’s now spread much more extensively in the industry, mainly due to Google opening up about the practice and evangelizing it. USENIX launched the first SREcon in 2014, and Google published the Google SRE Book in 2016. As more companies have adopted SRE in their own ways, the meaning of the term has evolved. Every SRE team is different, but many themes will apply to SREs across companies.</p><p>We’ll next a look at the Engineering and Reliability parts of SRE, SRE team structures, and then talk about some ways you can get started as an SRE.</p><h2>Engineering</h2><p>As Ben Treynor Sloss says in the Google SRE book, “SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team.” In building the SRE team at Google, he focused on hiring software engineers, as opposed to traditional systems administrators. The idea was to make the SRE team a force multiplier. By automating more of the work they do, the SRE team could manage the rapidly growing systems at Google while scaling the team less.</p><p>Toil is an essential concept in SRE. As Vivek Rau points out&nbsp;<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/">in the Google SRE book</a>, toil isn’t simply work that the Goole SREs don’t want to do. He defines some criteria for what kind of work is considered toil:</p><ul><li>Manual</li><li>Repetitive</li><li>Automatable</li><li>Tactical</li><li>No enduring value</li><li>Scales with service growth</li></ul><p>By working to eliminate the tasks we do that are toil, we give ourselves time to focus on more exciting work. Google expects its SREs to spend 50% or more of their time working on engineering projects outside of regular operational work.</p><p>It’s important to note that the SRE focus on automation didn’t arise in a vacuum. The early 2000s saw Configuration Management emerge as a practice and Infrastructure as Code. Titles like Operations Engineer and Infrastructure Engineer became more common, as teams realized they could leverage automation to make the tasks they do more repeatable. Tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and later Terraform, have allowed people to provision and maintain large infrastructures through code.</p><p>The level of engineering work that happens in an SRE shop outside of Google can vary pretty widely. In some shops, teams will be mainly focused on using tools like Terraform and Kubernetes that are written by someone else, and using APIs to glue things together. Other shops will have SREs that write a lot of code, and even write services that manage things like provisioning or deployments. Some of those tools become open sourced and shared with large communities.</p><p>SREs at Google contribute code to the services written by Google’s Sofware Engineers (SWEs). In other shops, there may be a more explicit boundary between who commits code for those services, and SREs may only be able to land code to their SRE team’s codebases.</p><p>If you’re looking at potential SRE roles, it’s important to get an idea of what kind of engineering work the team does and how that fits with your skills and interests.</p><h2>Reliability</h2><p>Reliability is the core job of SREs, and it encompasses many areas (see that list in the first paragraph). We’ll focus here on some key concepts that are unique to SRE: service level indicators, service level objectives, and error budgets.</p><h3>Service Level Indicators (SLIs)</h3><p>Let’s start with service level indicators. The chapter in the Google SRE book that covers them (written by Chris Jones, John Wilkes, and Niall Murphy with Cody Smith) defines an SLI as “a carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.” Said more simply, an SLI is a metric of some sort that indicates something about the performance or health of the service. Some common examples of SLIs are request latency and error rate, but there can be many others depending on your service. It’s important to note that “the CPU of the host is at 75 percent usage” is not the kind of thing that makes for a good SLI. We want to look at metrics that describe the health of the service to the people that are using it. An end-user doesn’t care about your CPU usage. They only care that they can do what they need to with your application in a reasonable amount of time.</p><h3>Service Level Objectives (SLOs)</h3><p>Next are service level objectives (SLOs). The Google SRE book defines an SLO as “a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI.” So what does that mean? An SLO is the higher-order measure of the service’s health and performance from the perspective of the user. When you think about SLOs, think about things that impact users. An example of an SLO from the book is, “99% (averaged over 1 minute) of Get RPC calls will complete in less than 100 ms (measured across all the backend servers).” It’s very precise. We can infer that if the Get RPC calls fail more than 99% of the time, or complete slower than 100 milliseconds, users will be unhappy. In the end, that’s what reliability is for, making the people who use our applications happy.</p><h3>Error Budgets</h3><p>Error budgets are the last of these three pillars of reliability. Error budgets are covered in&nbsp;<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/">another chapter</a>&nbsp;of the Google SRE book, written by Marc Alvidrez. Alvidrez defines an error budget as “a clear, objective metric that determines how unreliable the service is allowed to be within a single quarter.” SLIs and SLOs bubble up into error budgets, and error budgets are the clear, quantitative measure of how our service is doing reliability wise. Error budgets also give us guard rails for how we operate our services. If your service is well below its error budget for the quarter, that’s a great time to innovate and take risks. If your service is running out of error budget, that’s a time to slow down and be more conservative. With an error budget, we have a number that lets us know whether we’re at risk of making our users unhappy.</p><h3>Alerting</h3><p>SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets represent a huge shift in thinking from how traditional sysadmins looked at systems. One of the biggest things this impacts is what teams send alerts on. I recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.firehydrant.io/blog/qa-with-alex-hidalgo-on-slos/">interviewed Alex Hidalgo</a>, who is writing a book called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-service-level/9781492076803/">Implementing Service Level Objectives</a>&nbsp;for O’Reilly, and I asked him about this topic. He said:</p><blockquote><p>“In a perfect world, the only page a team receives is when you’re burning through your error budget at a rate that you cannot recover from without human intervention. It takes a lot of maturity and time to get there, but I’ve worked on teams where we successfully got to this point. It’s not impossible! The idea is that if your SLI is meaningfully measuring what your users need from your service, why wake people up in the middle of the night for any reason beyond this SLI reporting things are bad for your users too much of the time? Why wake someone up if error rates have spiked if that doesn’t actually impact the user experience in any way?”</p></blockquote><p>So instead of Pager Duty or your NOC calling someone at 3 AM to tell them that a CPU is at 75 percent usage, you alert on situations where you’re at risk of running out of error budget.</p><p>But what about the lower-level problems? What if a disk is full or a host is down? We want to know about that still, right? Well, we do, but not at 3 AM. Instead, we can create a ticket in our ticketing system to let us know about the problem. If those conditions are impacting users, we’ll get an alert about it indirectly based on the error budget, and we can deal with the problem then. If not, we can clean up that disk or provision a new host during regular working hours.</p><p>As Alex mentioned, it takes some work to get to that point, but it’s well worth it if you can make it there.</p><h2>Team Structures</h2><p>Every SRE team is different and will have its own structure, but some popular patterns for team structures have emerged. At Google, while SREs belong to a team together, they work embedded on teams that are building services. Another common pattern is to have a core team of SREs that support all of the other teams. Let’s compare these two options.</p><p>The pattern where SREs are embedded in service teams makes a lot of sense. People who specialize in a specific service or several are likely to gain a lot of expertise and domain knowledge about how those services work. That can be very handy when troubleshooting, or rolling out new versions of the service. But I think there’s at least the potential that people working in this model end up heads down, focused on the services they support, and not sharing knowledge across the broader SRE team. I’ve also spoken to several Google SREs who supported different kinds of services, and it became clear to me pretty quickly that their experiences differed quite a bit depending on the service team they were embedded with. Some factors that may come into play are the age of the service, and the risk tolerance of the company when it comes to operating that service.</p><p>The core SRE team pattern, where there is a central team of SREs, also has advantages. This team can potentially work closer together and communicate better, but that comes with likely having less expertise in the services, depending on how many services there are. Teams in this pattern often operate more as a higher tier of escalation for problems, and provide infrastructure and tools that the service teams use. A big focus of this kind of team is creating self-service infrastructure. They want to make their infra as easy as possible for other teams to consume. They may manage Kubernetes clusters that all of the service teams run their …</p></div></div>

It was absolutely unintentional,â€� said Dr. MozsÃ¡r.</p><p>Hundreds of hybrids emerged from those eggs and a month later, more than two-thirds of them were still alive. Around 100 of these hybrids are alive today.</p><p>Both creatures are known as â€œfossil fishâ€� because of their ancient lineage. Their last common ancestor swam during the age of the dinosaurs, and the two have been evolving independently, on opposite sides of the planet, for over 184 million years â€” which makes them nearly twice as evolutionarily diverged as humans and mice. That led scientists to assume that they were too evolutionarily diverged to be hybridized.</p><p>The sturddlefish created in Hungary exhibited traits from both species. Although all have their motherâ€™s mouth and carnivorous appetite, some have their fatherâ€™s fins and snout â€” though slightly smaller. After conducting DNA analysis on eight sturddlefish, the researchers were able to separate the hybrids into two groups. Some of the sturddlefish got a double-dose of DNA from their mother, and look far more like sturgeon than paddlefish. The others received nearly equal amounts of maternal and paternal DNA, and look like a perfect mash-up of the two species.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/15/science/15TB-STURGEON3/merlin_174585732_3ca9c5f1-bbcf-4c89-a7ba-d03f4885b037-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div></div></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>FlÃ³riÃ¡n TÃ³th</span></span></figcaption><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/15/science/15TB-STURGEON3/merlin_174585732_3ca9c5f1-bbcf-4c89-a7ba-d03f4885b037-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp"></figure></div></div><div><p>Russian sturgeon and American paddlefish may not seem as if they have much in common, but the fact that they can hybridize suggests they may be more alike than previously thought.</p></div><div><div><p>â€œMany aspects of their anatomy and physiology are actually very similar,â€� said Dennis Scarnecchia, professor of fishery resources at the University of Idaho.

                        <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591848729219073">hacks</a> are the last straw. We need to exit Twitter.</p><p>But you may be invested in Twitter! So what do you do? Here's one recipe for <em>gradual</em> exit.</p><ol><li>Step one is to set up an (optionally pseudonymous) newsletter at your <em>own</em> custom domain using the instructions <a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">here</a>. You can do this in an hour and maintain it for less than $30 per month. Then only tweet out posts from your site, using your domain name as a simple form of authentication.</li><li>Step two is to start building your membership list at your own site. If you want, help us review <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export">open source tools</a> to export your Twitter following to an email list and <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1284155565770498050">mass delete any DMs</a>.</li><li>And step three is to get off Twitter all together, and start building a decentralized media ecosystem that combines the sovereignty of individual domain names with the community of social networking. The v1 of that is a simple joint RSS feed that aggregates multiple independent newsletters, but we can get much more <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1280005821028397057">sophisticated</a> <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb">with</a> <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-state-of-the-art-of-decentralized-web-part-4-212732f74894">tech</a> <a href="https://gun.eco/docs/dWeb-The-Decentralized-Web">for</a> <a href="https://ens.domains/">the</a> <a href="https://handshake.org/">decentralized</a> <a href="https://ipfs.io/">web</a>. It may turn out that what we build helps reform Twitter itself, but at a minimum it will present an alternative.</li></ol><p>Before we get there though, let's go through the problems with Twitter.</p><h2 id="the-problems-with-twitter">The Problems with Twitter</h2><p>It's not just the hack. There are several overlapping issues with Twitter around security, authentication, pseudonymity, distribution, incentives, and culture.</p><ul><li><em>Twitter is insecure</em>. It was a mistake to think that personal security could compensate for the fundamental flaw of centralized web services: anyone who gains control over twitter.com gains control over your account. We knew this already from the <a href="http://archive.is/Bq5qi">2017 incident</a> and the <a href="http://archive.is/wip/scJMn">Jack Hack</a>. But now the most prominent people and companies in the world (Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Musk, Apple, Uber, among others) have been <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591848729219073">openly and publicly hacked</a>. Tomorrow you may be the victim. And unlike these worthies, you may be <em>silently</em> and <em>privately</em> hacked. Perhaps you already have been.</li><li><em>Twitter is not authenticated</em>. It was a mistake to trust Twitter's centralized verification process to validate everything posted to the service. There weren't any <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp#:~:text=A%20digital%20wallet%20stores%20the,to%20use%20the%20private%20key.">digital signatures</a> to help establish whether the messages were really coming from a user-controlled device, or faked by a central server.</li><li><em>Twitter is not fully pseudonymous</em>. It was a mistake to use our real names everywhere online, particularly on Twitter. It made us vulnerable to personal and physical attacks. Social media mobs can swarm your real name online and cancel you in real life. Doxxing can heighten the danger by making threats <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/reflections-upon-a-swatting/">materialize in</a> <a href="https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md">meatspace</a>. Pseudonymity is a better default, especially now that we can <a href="http://www.marknagelberg.com/notes-on-the-pseudonymous-economy-balaji-srinivasan/">earn under a pseudonym</a>.</li><li><em>Twitter is a distribution chokepoint</em>. It was a mistake to outsource our distribution to Twitter. Twitter users don't fully control their reach, brand, or monetization. You can be <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-reveals-how-it-ranks-tweets-in-search-results/263869/">downranked</a> or <a href="http://archive.is/mhgyB">deplatformed</a> at any time, just like you can on YouTube and other centralized platforms. Owning your <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465992-How-do-I-export-my-email-or-subscriber-list-">own</a> <a href="http://locals.com/">email</a> <a href="https://ghost.org/members">list</a> is a far better alternative.</li><li><em>Twitter doesn't create wealth</em>. It was a mistake to have so many people spending so much time on something that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1271834488998440961">arguably</a> destroys more wealth than it creates. Because by default, you don't create wealth on Twitter. You may create wealth <em>for</em> Twitter, or for the media corporations whose links are circulated, but not for yourself or for others. There's no sense of economic alignment with other users, no sense of mutual obligation.</li><li><em>Twitter turns society into Twitter</em>. It was a mistake to let Twitter set up the incentives for our society. It's not good for the world when the one thing every prominent person knows how to do is <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1272653587617701888">fight</a> each other on Twitter for likes and followers. It has converted society into a zero-sum status game played by elites with real consequences. Every day, blue checks compete for a finite pie of attention with ever more sensational posts. There is instant feedback on what is popular, but none on what is true. The lack of economics, the presence of real names, the toxic culture, and the UX itself all encourage constant fighting.</li></ul><p>Now, let me qualify these comments. I personally have gotten <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1271834488998440961">enormous value</a> out of Twitter, despite all the points above. After all, you only critique the services you use!</p><p>And to be clear, Jack Dorsey is a phenomenal entrepreneur. I respect everything he's done and the team that he's built. It's hard to build one multibillion dollar company, let alone <a href="http://archive.is/wip/bu6hJ">two</a>. He's done immense good for the world overall, both through his <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1247616214769086465">personal generosity</a> and his startup vehicles. And I also don't wish any Twitter employee ill, as many of them are truly great people and I know how hard this stuff is.</p><p>Moreover, even after this hack, Twitter will likely continue to be an important internet battlefield for quite sometime. It's just too easy, too convenient. And it may turn out that whatever is built to exit Twitter will end up interfacing with Twitter itself, via their <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky">decentralized protocol</a>, if only as a form of training wheels to help people get off. Hopefully this can be done in a win-win way, such that Twitter and its employees are incentivized to allow people to gradually exit and fix the issues on the centralized service.</p><p>But it's past time for us to start building something better, that keeps the good aspects of Twitter (the serendipitous learning, the fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1214585024772788224">people</a>) but filters the bad. That may mean exiting to our own domains and then networking them into decentralized media.</p><h2 id="decentralization-starts-with-a-domain">Decentralization Starts with a Domain</h2><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Can we network together websites into decentralized media with something deeper than links?</figcaption></figure><p>I may be wrong about this, but I don't think a "better Twitter" starts with a service which is simply a clone of Twitter except with a different community. I think it starts with a community of independent (and independently monetizable) domains that we network together in novel ways, to build <em>decentralized media</em>.</p><p>Towards this end, the first step in gradually exiting Twitter is to set up your own paid newsletter at a custom domain (<a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">instructions here</a>) and restrict yourself mainly to tweeting out posts. This does require more effort than writing 280 characters! But that's why it's good. Effort helps restore your attention span and improves average post quality. And in addition to the other benefits, the link to your domain doubles as a simple alternative to a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp#:~:text=A%20digital%20wallet%20stores%20the,to%20use%20the%20private%20key.">digital signature</a>, a way for people to see that the content is authentically yours. </p><p>The medium-term step is to develop <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export">tools</a> to migrate your followers off Twitter to an email list, and to mass delete all DMs as a precautionary step. If you want to help review some existing tools towards this end, we're working on it <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export/issues/1">here</a>.</p><p>The long-term step is to start addressing the issues with Twitter by knitting these individual domains together into an open source decentralized media ecosystem. That means addressing:</p><ul><li>Security by encouraging people to post from their own domains</li><li>Community by building a network around multiple domains</li><li>Authentication by combining domains with digital signatures</li><li>Distribution via memberships and email lists</li><li>Incentives by baking in monetization and economic alignment from the beginning</li><li>Mobs by recommending pseudonymity by default</li><li>Culture by encouraging physical norms of civility</li></ul><p>Crucially, unlike past efforts our goal would be to build this <em>community-first</em> rather than <em>technology-first</em>. Specifically, once we get enough paid newsletters set up at their own domains, we can experiment with new decentralized web technologies for linking them together. If you submit your URL to <a href="https://forms.gle/xqvAFgW43Hc7rVzJA">this form</a>, we'll see if we can form a community. We'll probably start with a joint <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feed and then <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/">get more sophisticated</a>.</p><p>Oh, and you can signal that you're interested in decentralized media by changing your name on Twitter to your URL, as <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">follows</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Exiting Twitter and building decentralized media will be a long project and we aren't assured of success. But this journey of a thousand miles begins with a single newsletter at your own domain! So <a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">set yours up</a> now. </p><p>It's time to start gradually exiting Twitter.</p>

<p>When it comes to hashing, sometimes 64 bit is not enough, for example, because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday paradox</a> — the hacker can iterate through random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> entities and it can be proven that with some constant probability they will find a collision, i.e. two different objects will have the same hash. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> is around 4 billion objects and with the current power capacity in each computer it is certainly achievable. That’s why we need sometimes to advance the bitness of hashing to at least 128 bits. Unfortunately, it comes with a cost because platforms and CPUs do not support 128 bit operations natively.</p>



<p>Division historically is the most complex operation on CPUs and all guidelines suggest avoiding the division at all costs.</p>



<p>At my job I faced an interesting problem of optimizing 128 bit division from <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/numeric/int128.cc#L155">abseil library</a> in order to split some data across buckets with the help of 128 bit hashing (the number of buckets is not fixed for some uninteresting historical reasons). I found out that the division takes a really long time. The <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/numeric/int128_benchmark.cc#L52">benchmarks</a> from abseil on Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2135 CPU @ 3.70GHz show some horrible results</p>



<pre><code>Benchmark                       Time(ns)  CPU(ns)
BM_DivideClass128UniformDivisor     13.8     13.8  // 128 bit by 128 bit
BM_DivideClass128SmallDivisor        168      168  // 128 bit by 64 bit</code></pre>



<p>150 nanoseconds for dividing the random 128 bit number by a random 64 bit number? Sounds crazy. For example, <code>div</code> instruction on x86-64 Skylake takes 76 cycles (also, for AMD processors it is much less), the division takes around 20-22ns.</p>

<p>In reality everything is slightly better because of pipeline execution and division has its own ALU, so if you divide something and do something else in the next instructions, you will get lower average latency. Still, 128 bit division cannot be 8x slower than 64 bit division. All latencies you can find in Agner Fog <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf">instruction table</a> for most of the modern x86 CPUs. The truth is more complex and division latency can even depend on the values given.</p>

<p>Even compilers when dividing by some constants, try to use the reciprocal (or, the same as inverse in a ring) value and multiply the reciprocal and the value with some shifts afterwards</p>

<p>Overall, given the fact that only some <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code> instructions cost more than division, division is one of the most complex instructions in CPUs and optimizations in that place matter a lot. My exact case was more or less general, maybe I was dividing 128 bit by 64 bit a bit more frequent. We are going to optimize the general case in LLVM.</p>



<p>We need to understand how 128 bit division is working through the compiler stack.</p>

<p>It calls <code>__udivti3</code> function. Let’s first understand how to read these functions. In runtime libraries the modes of the functions are:</p>



<div><div>
<pre><code>QI: An integer that is as wide as the smallest addressable unit, usually 8 bits.
HI: An integer, twice as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 16 bits.
SI: An integer, four times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 32 bits.
DI: An integer, eight times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 64 bits.
SF: A floating point value, as wide as a SI mode integer, usually 32 bits.
DF: A floating point value, as wide as a DI mode integer, usually 64 bits.
TI: An integer, 16 times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 128 bits.</code></pre>
</div></div>



<p>So, <code>udivti3</code> is an <strong>u</strong>nsigned division of TI (128 bits) integers, last ‘<em>3′</em> means that it has 3 arguments including the return value. Also, there is a function <code>__udivmodti4</code> which computes the divisor and the remainder (division and modulo operation) and it has 4 arguments including the returning value. These functions are a part of runtime libraries which compilers provide by default. For example, in GCC it is <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html#Libgcc">libgcc</a>, in LLVM it is <a href="https://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt</a>, they are linked almost in every program if you have the corresponding toolchain. In LLVM, <code>__udivti3</code> is a simple alias to <code>__udivmodti4</code>.</p>

<p><code><a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/release_90/lib/builtins/udivmodti4.c#L20">__udivmodti4</a></code> function was written with the help of <code>Translated from Figure 3-40 of The PowerPC Compiler Writer's Guide.</code> After looking at it <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2005-590/powerpc-cwg.pdf">here</a>, it looks like this was written long time ago and things have changed since then</p>

<p>First of all, let’s come up with something easy, like shift-subtract algorithm that we have been learning since childhood. First, if <code>divisor &gt; dividend</code>, then the quotient is zero and remainder is the <code>dividend</code>, not an interesting case. </p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>The algorithm is easy, we align the numbers by their most significant bits, if dividend is more than divisor, subtract and add 1 to the output, then shift by 1 and repeat.  Some sort of animation can be seen like that:</p>

<p>For 128 bit division it will take at most 128 iterations in the for loop. Actually, the implementation in <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/release_90/lib/builtins/udivmodti4.c#L173">LLVM</a> for loop is a fallback and we saw it takes 150+ns to complete it because it requires to shift many registers because 128 bit numbers are represented as two registers.</p>



<p>Now, let’s dive into the architecture features. I noticed that while the compiler generates the <code>divq</code> instructions, it frees <code>rdx</code> register</p>

<p><code>divq</code> instruction provides 128 bit division from [%rdx]:[%rax] by <code>S</code>. The quotient is stored in <code>%rax</code> and the remainder in <code>%rdx</code>. After some experimenting with inline asm in C/C++, I figured out that if the result does not fit in 64 bits, SIGFPE is raised. See:</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Compilers don’t use this instruction in 128 bit division because they cannot know for sure if the result is going to fit in 64 bits. Yet, if the high 64 bits of the 128 bit number is smaller than the divisor, the result fits into 64 bits and we can use this instruction. As compilers don’t generate <code>div</code>q instruction for their own reasons, we would use inline asm for x86-64.</p>

<p>What to do if the high is not less than the divisor? The right answer is to use 2 divisions because</p>

<p>So, first we can divide <code>hi</code> by <code>divisor</code> and then <code>{hi_r, lo}</code> by <code>divisor</code> guaranteeing that <code>hi_r</code> is smaller than <code>divisor</code> and thus the result is smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}">. We will get something like</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>  After that the benchmarks improved significantly</p>



<pre><code>Benchmark                       Time(ns)  CPU(ns)
BM_DivideClass128UniformDivisor 11.9      11.9
BM_DivideClass128SmallDivisor   26.6      26.6</code></pre>



<p>Only 26.6ns for small divisors, that’s a clear 6x win.</p>



<p>Then there are multiple choices to do next but we know that both dividend and divisor have at least one bit in their high registers and the shift-subtract algorithm will have at most 64 iterations. Also the quotient is guaranteed to fit in 64 bits, thus we can use only the low register of the resulting quotient and save more shifts in the shift-subtract algorithm. That’s why the uniform divisor slightly improved.</p>



<p>One more optimization to do in shift-subtract algorithm is to remove the branch inside the for loop (read carefully, it should be understandable).</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>In the end, it gives 0.4ns more for uniform 128 bit divisor.</p>



<p>And finally I believe that’s one of the best algorithm to divide 128 bit by 128 bit numbers. From statistics, the case when the divisor is 64 bit is worth optimizing and we showed that additional checks on the high register of divisor has its own advantages and expansion of the invariants. Now let’s see what other libraries perform in that case.</p>



<h2>LibDivide</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide">Libdivide</a> is a small library targeting fast division, for example, if you divide by some fixed number a lot of times, there are techniques that can precalculate reciprocal and then multiply by it. Libdivide provides a very good interface for such optimizations. Even though, it has some optimizations regarding 128 bit division. For example, function <code>libdivide_128_div_128_to_64</code> computes the division 128 bit number by 128 bit number if the result fits in 64 bits. In the case where both numbers are more or equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> it does the following algorithm that they took from <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Hackers-Delight-Henry-S-Warren/dp/0321842685/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Hackers+Delight&amp;qid=1592164234&amp;sr=8-1">Hackers Delight</a> book:</p>

<p>With the instruction that produces the 64 bit result when the divisor is 128 bit result we can compute</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bquotient_1%7D+%3D+%5Clfloor+%5Cmathrm%7Bdividend_1%7D%2F%5Cmathrm%7Bdivisor_1%7D+%5Crfloor&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="\mathrm{quotient_1} = \lfloor \mathrm{dividend_1}/\mathrm{divisor_1} \rfloor" title="\mathrm{quotient_1} = \lfloor \mathrm{dividend_1}/\mathrm{divisor_1} \rfloor"></p>



<p>Then we compute</p>

Now let’s show that</p>

<p>Now we want to show that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3C+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="\delta < 1" title="\delta < 1">. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="\delta" title="\delta"> is the largest when the remainder in the numerator is as large as possible, it can be up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64+-+n%7D+-+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="2^{64 - n} - 1" title="2^{64 - n} - 1">. Because of the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="n" title="n">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bdivisor%7D+%5Cgeq+2%5E%7B127+-+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="\mathrm{divisor} \geq 2^{127 - n}" title="\mathrm{divisor} \geq 2^{127 - n}">. The smallest value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bdivisor%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="\mathrm{divisor}" title="\mathrm{divisor}"> in the denominator is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B127+-+n%7D+%2B+2%5E%7B64+-+n%7D+-+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="2^{127 - n} + 2^{64 - n} - 1" title="2^{127 - n} + 2^{64 - n} - 1">. That’s why</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bdividend%7D%282%5E%7B64+-+n%7D+-+1%29%7D%7B%282%5E%7B127+-+n%7D+%2B+2%5E%7B64+-+n%7D+-+1%292%5E%7B127+-+n+%7D%7D+%3C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bdividend%7D%282%5E%7B64+-+n%7D+-+1%29%7D%7B%282%5E%7B127+-+n+%7D%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="\delta \leq \frac{\mathrm{dividend}(2^{64 - n} - 1)}{(2^{127 - n} + 2^{64 - n} - 1)2^{127 - n }} < \frac{\mathrm{dividend}(2^{64 - n} - 1)}{(2^{127 - n })^2}" title="\delta \leq \frac{\mathrm{dividend}(2^{64 - n} - 1)}{(2^{127 - n} + 2^{64 - n} - 1)2^{127 - n }} < \frac{\mathrm{dividend}(2^{64 - n} - 1)}{(2^{127 - n })^2}">. As n iterates from 0 to 63, we can conclude that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bdividend%7D%7D%7B2%5E%7B128%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0" alt="\delta < \frac{\mathrm{dividend}}{2^{128}}" title="\delta < \frac{\mathrm{dividend}}{2^{128}}">. So we got either the correct value, either the correct plus one. Everything else in the algorithms is just a correction of which result to choose.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, these corrections increase the latency of the benchmark pretty significant</p>



<pre><code>Benchmark                                          Time(ns)  CPU(ns)
BM_DivideClass128UniformDivisor&lt;LibDivideDivision&gt;    26.3    26.3  
BM_RemainderClass128UniformDivisor&lt;LibDivideDivision&gt; 26.2    26.2
BM_DivideClass128SmallDivisor&lt;LibDivideDivision&gt;      25.8    25.8
BM_RemainderClass128SmallDivisor&lt;LibDivideDivision&gt;   26.3    26.3</code></pre>



<p>So I decided to drop this idea after I’ve tried this.</p>



<h2>GMP</h2>



<p><a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> library is a standard GNU library for long arithmetic. They also have something for 128 bit by 64 bit division and in my benchmark the following code worked</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>It divides the two limbs by a <code>uint64_t</code> and provides the result. Unfortunately, the latency is much higher than expected, also does not work</p>



<pre><code>Benchmark                                          Time(ns)  CPU(ns)
BM_DivideClass128UniformDivisor&lt;GmpDivision&gt;          11.5    11.5

BM_DivideClass128SmallDivisor&lt;GmpDivision&gt;            47.5    47.5

<p>2019-10</p>

<p>You’re reading a <a href="https://brandur.org/aws-intrinsic-static">static website</a> stored in S3 and served out of CloudFront. I recently set up web analytics for it with:</p>

<ul>
<li>CloudFront access logs stored in S3</li>
<li>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">AWS Athena</a> analytics engine running SQL queries on that data</li>
</ul>

<p>I now get analytics with flexible SQL queries:</p>

<p><img src="https://markmcgranaghan.com/assets/cloudfront-analytics/athena-demo.png" alt="Athena demo"></p><p>This proved a solid approach. There’s no software I need to manage, no client-side JavaScript, and no third-party providers beyond AWS. Here’s how I set it up and use it.</p>

<h2>Sending CloudFront logs to S3</h2>

<p>First we need to store CloudFront access logs in S3. As a bonus, we’ll have this raw data if we want to analyze it outside of Athena later.</p><p>Ensure you have an S3 bucket to use for logs. I use one bucket for all my sites, with a directory for each site:</p>

<p><img src="https://markmcgranaghan.com/assets/cloudfront-analytics/cloudfront-logs-index.png" alt="CloudFront logs index"></p><p>Then in the CloudFront distribution for your site, enable access logging into that bucket (and into the appropriate directory if you’re using that setup):</p>

<p><img src="https://markmcgranaghan.com/assets/cloudfront-analytics/cloudfront-logs-enabling.png" alt="CloudFront logs enabling"></p><p>Cloudfront will deposit access logs in that directory every few minutes, assuming you have non-zero traffic. Here’s what mine look like:</p>

<p><img src="https://markmcgranaghan.com/assets/cloudfront-analytics/cloudfront-logs-listing.png" alt="CloudFront logs listing"></p><p>If you download, decompress, and view one of those files, you’ll see lines of tab-seperated data, one per request to CloudFront. Each line will have the request URL, HTTP method, referrer, and so on.</p>

<p>The appeal of the Athena approach is that you can run SQL queries <em>directly against these compressed log files</em> in S3 with <em>standard SQL</em>. Let’s look at that next.</p>


<h2>Querying web access logs in Athena</h2>

<p>Now head over to Athena in the AWS console and create a database to use for your CloudFront analytics. I called mine “cloudfront”:</p>

<p><img src="https://markmcgranaghan.com/assets/cloudfront-analytics/athena-database-ddl.png" alt="Athena database DDL"></p><p>Create a table that points to your data in S3, using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cloudfront-logs.html">this query template</a>, with your S3 location sub’d in. This query also shows the fields you’ll have access to in your SQL queries:</p>

<p><img src="https://markmcgranaghan.com/assets/cloudfront-analytics/athena-table-ddl.png" alt="Athena table DDL"></p><p>That’s it, you’re ready to run some queries. Here’s one I use to measure total monthly traffic to the site:</p>

<p><img src="https://markmcgranaghan.com/assets/cloudfront-analytics/athena-results.png" alt="Athena results"></p><p>Note that even though this query covers data from thousands of individual compressed files in S3, it runs in a few seconds.</p>

<p>You should carefully examine your data to be sure you’re getting the right results. For example some requests are from <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?hl=en">Googlebot</a> and you may want to exclude those from your queries.</p>

<p>Overall I’ve been very happy with this analytics setup. I recommend it for anyone running a static site looking for basic analytics without the downsides of client-side JavaScript, additional third parties providers, or more software to run themselves.</p>

<p>If you have thoughts on the setup, <a href="https://markmcgranaghan.com/contact">send</a> them over!</p>

The paper that introduced Bitcask to the world says it is a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system">Log-Structured</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> for Fast Key/Value Data</em> which, in a simpler language, means that the data will be written sequentially to an append-only log file and there will be pointers for each <code>key</code> pointing to the <code>position</code> of its log entry. Building a KV store off the append-only log files seems like a really weird design choice, but Bitcask does not only make it efficient but it also gives a really high Read-Write throughput.</p>
<p>Bitcask was introduced as the backend for a distributed database named <a href="https://riak.com/">Riak</a> in which each node used to run one instance of Bitcask to hold the data that it was responsible for. In this essay, we take a detailed look into Bitcask, its design, and find the secret sauce that makes it so performant.</p>

<p>Bitcask uses a lot of principles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system">log-structured file systems</a> and draws inspiration from a number of designs that involve log file merging, for example - merging in LSM Trees. It essentially is just a directory of append-only (log) files with a fixed structure and an in-memory index holding the keys mapped to a bunch of information necessary for point lookups - referring to the entry in the datafile.</p>
<h2>Datafiles</h2>
<p>Datafiles are append-only log files that hold the KV pairs along with some meta-information. A single Bitcask instance could have many datafiles, out of which just one will be active and opened for writing, while the others are considered immutable and are only used for reads.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/87866701-78fdb800-c9a2-11ea-9c35-9a706ac96d97.png" alt="Bitcask Datafiles"></p>
<p>Each entry in the datafile has a fixed structure illustrated above and it stores <code>crc</code>, <code>timestamp</code>, <code>key_size</code>, <code>value_size</code>, actual <code>key</code>, and the actual <code>value</code>. All the write operations - create, update and delete - made on the engine translates into entries in this active datafile. When this active datafile meets a size threshold, it is closed and a new active datafile is created; and as stated earlier, when closed (intentionally or unintentionally), the datafile is considered immutable and is never opened for writing again.</p>
<h2>KeyDir</h2>
<p>KeyDir is an in-memory hash table that stores all the keys present in the Bitcask instance and maps it to the offset in the datafile where the log entry (value) resides; thus facilitating the point lookups. The mapped value in the Hash Table is a structure that holds <code>file_id</code>, <code>offset</code>, and some meta-information like <code>timestamp</code>, as illustrated below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/87866707-96cb1d00-c9a2-11ea-9730-fc7f8cb79b92.png" alt="Bitcask KeyDir"></p>

<p>Now that we have seen the overall design and components of Bitcask, we can jump into exploring the operations that it supports and details of their implementations.</p>
<h3>Putting a new Key Value</h3>
<p>When a new KV pair is submitted to be stored in the Bitcask, the engine first appends it to the active datafile and then creates a new entry in the KeyDir specifying the offset and file where the value is stored. Both of these actions are performed atomically which means either the entry is made in both the structures or none.</p>
<p>Putting a new Key-Value pair requires just one atomic operation encapsulating one disk write and a few in-memory access and updates. Since the active datafile is an append-only file, the disk write operation does not have to perform any disk seek whatsoever making the write operate at an optimum rate providing a high write throughput.</p>
<h3>Updating an existing Key Value</h3>
<p>This KV store does not support partial update, out of the box, but it does support full value replacement. Hence the update operation is very similar to putting a new KV pair, the only change being instead of creating an entry in KeyDir, the existing entry is updated with the new position in, possibly, the new datafile.</p>
<p>The entry corresponding to the old value is now dangling and will be garbage collected explicitly during merging and compaction.</p>
<h3>Deleting a Key</h3>
<p>Deleting a key is a special operation where the engine atomically appends a new entry in the active datafile with value equalling a tombstone value, denoting deletion, and deleting the entry from the in-memory KeyDir. The tombstone value is chosen as something very unique so that it does not interfere with the existing value space.</p>
<p>Delete operation, just like the update operation, is very lightweight and requires a disk write and an in-memory update. In delete operation as well, the older entries corresponding to the deleted keys are left dangling and will be garbage collected explicitly during merging and compaction.</p>
<h3>Reading a Key-Value</h3>
<p>Reading a KV pair from the store requires the engine to first find the datafile and the offset within it for the given key; which is done using the KeyDir. Once that information is available the engine then performs one disk read from the corresponding datafile at the offset to retrieve the log entry. The correctness of the value retrieved is checked against the CRC stored and the value is then returned to the client.</p>
<p>The operation is inherently fast as it requires just one disk read and a few in-memory accesses, but it could be made faster using Filesystem read-ahead cache.</p>

<p>As we have seen during Update and Delete operations the old entries corresponding to the key remain untouched and dangling and this leads to Bitcask consuming a lot of disk space. In order to make things efficient for the disk utilization the engine once a while compacts the older closed datafiles into one or many merged files having the same structure as the existing datafiles.</p>
<p>The merge process iterates over all the immutable files in the Bitcask and produces a set of datafiles having only <em>live</em> and <em>latest</em> versions of each present key. This way the unused and non-existent keys are ignored from the newer datafiles saving a bunch of disk space. Since the record now exists in a different merged datafile and at a new offset, its entry in KeyDir needs an atomic updation.</p>

<p>If the Bitcask crashes and needs a boot-up, it will have to read all the datafiles and build a new KeyDir. Merging and compaction here do help as it reduces the need to read data that is eventually going to be evicted. But there is another operation that could help in making the boot times faster.</p>
<p>For every datafile a <em>hint</em> file is created which holds everything in the datafile except the value i.e. it holds the key and its meta-information. This <em>hint</em> file, hence, is just a file containing all the keys from the corresponding datafile. This <em>hint</em> file is very small in size and hence by reading this file the engine could quickly create the entire KeyDir and complete the bootup process faster.</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low latency for read and write operations</li>
<li>High Write Throughput</li>
<li>Single disk seek to retrieve any value</li>
<li>Predictable lookup and insert performance</li>
<li>Crash recovery is fast and bounded</li>
<li>Backing up is easy - Just copy the directory would suffice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<p>The KeyDir holds all the keys in memory at all times and this adds a huge constraint on the system that it needs to have enough memory to contain the entire keyspace along with other essentials like Filesystem buffers. Thus the limiting factor for a Bitcask is the limited RAM available to hold the KeyDir.</p>
<p>Although this weakness sees a major one but the solution to this is fairly simple. We can typically shard the keys and scale it horizontally without losing much of the basic operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete.</p>

<p><em>[83] Published 18. July 2020.</em></p><p>
  This is my response to the
  <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-069/">
  Perl Weekly Challenge #069</a>.
</p>


<h2>Challenge #069.1: Strobogrammatic Number</h2>
<div><p>
  A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when looked at upside down.
  </p><p>
  
  
  You are given two positive numbers <code>$A</code> and <code>$B</code> such that
  <code>1 &lt;= $A &lt;= $B &lt;= 10^15</code>.
  </p><p>
  

  Write a script to print all strobogrammatic numbers between the given two numbers.
  </p><p>
  

  <b>Example</b><br>

<code><pre>Input: $A = 50, $B = 100
Output: 69, 88, 96
</pre></code></p></div>


<p>
  <i></i> Consulting
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobogrammatic_number">Wikipedia</a>
  is illuminating. It confirms that the challenge got it wrong; we do not turn
  the number upside down, but rotate it 180 degrees. The digits are:
  <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>8</code> (symmetrical) and
  <code>6</code> and <code>9</code> (asymmetrical).
</p>

<p>
  <i></i> The wikipedia article also mentions
  <code>2</code> and <code>5</code> (asymmetrical) under the label
  <em>Nonstandard systems</em>. They should be familiar to users of calculators
  with dot matrix displays. The number <code>52</code> is a Strobogrammatic Number
  if we include <code>2</code> and <code>5</code>. It is not present in the
  challenge, so should not be part of this solution. But it is easy to do so,
  and I have added a command line option to enable them.

<code><pre>say ($A .. $B).grep( *.&amp;is-strobogrammatic ).join(", ");
</pre></code></p><h3>A Perl Version</h3><p>
  This is pretty much a straight forward translation from the Raku version:
</p><p>

File: strobonum-perl

</pre></code></p><p>[1] A future (and just announced)
  <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/announcing-perl-7/">Perl 7</a> can make
  all of these lines disappear. The backwards compatibility in Perl 5 is in general
  a good idea, but this is the price we pay. For now..</p>
<p>[2] Handling the arguments takes a lot of code, compared to the Raku version
  with one line of code (shown with newlines to make it easier to read). I could
  have used a module, but there are so many to choose from.</p>
<p>[3] I replaced the <code>all</code> and <code>any</code> junctions in The Raku
  version with a simple <code>return</code> inside the <code>map</code>. (The
  «List::Util» module supplies them, so it is possible to use them in Perl.) The
  result is a very compact line of code, that is hard to understand. </p>

<h3>A Perl and Raku Comparison</h3><p>
  The last line in the program really shows off the advantage of Raku over Perl
  in producing readable code:
</p><p>

Raku:
<code><pre>say ($A .. $B).grep( *.&amp;is-strobogrammatic ).join(", ");
</pre></code>

Perl:
<code><pre>say join(", ", grep { is_strobogrammatic($_) } ($A .. $B));
</pre></code></p><p>
  The Perl version is harder to comprehend.

<h2>Challenge #069.2: 0/1 String</h2>
<div><p>
  A <code>0/1 string</code> is a string in which every character is either 0 or 1.
  </p><p>
  

  Write a script to perform switch and reverse to generate <code>S30</code> as
  described below:
  </p><p>
  
  
  <b>switch:</b><br>
  Every <code>S0</code> becomes <code>S1</code> and every <code>S1</code> becomes
  <code>S0</code>. For example, <code>101</code> becomes <code>010</code>.

  <b>reverse:</b><br>
  The string is reversed. For example, <code>001</code> becomes <code>100</code>.
  </p><p>
  

  <b>UPDATE (2020-07-13 17:00:00):</b>
  It was brought to my notice that generating <code>S1000</code> string would be
  nearly impossible. So I have decided to lower it down to <code>S30</code>.
  </p><p>
  

  Please follow the rule as below:
<code><pre>S0 = “”
S1 = “0”
S2 = “001”
S3 = “0010011”
…
SN = SN-1 + “0” + switch(reverse(SN-1))
</pre></code></p></div>

<p>
  <a id="gather/take"></a> We can use <code>gather</code>/<code>take</code> to set up
  a sequence of values:
</p><p>

File: 01-string
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

unit sub MAIN ($limit = 30);

sub switch ($string)
{
  return $string.comb.map({ $_ eq "1" ?? 0 !! 1 }).join;
}

my $string01 := gather
{
  take "";
  my $prev = "0"; take "0";

  loop
  {
    $prev = $prev ~ "0" ~ switch($prev.flip);
    take $prev;
  }
}

say "S$_ = \"{ $string01[$_] }\"" for 0..$limit;
</pre></code></p><p>
  <i></i> See my <a href="https://raku-musings.com/gather-take.html">Raku Gather,

  docs.raku.org/syntax/gather take</a> for more information about
  <code>gather</code>/<code>take</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Running it:
</p>

<p><code><pre>$ ./01-string 4

S2 = "001"
S3 = "0010011"
S4 = "001001100011011"
</pre></code></p><p>
  <i></i> Running the program to 30 caused my
  pc to crash, but I'll get back to that later.
</p>

<p>
  We can make the program shorter by optimizing the <code>gather</code>/<code>take</code>
  block:
</p><p>

File: 01-string-smart (partial)
<code><pre>my $string01 := gather
{
  my $prev = "";

  loop
  {
    take $prev;
    $prev = $prev ~ "0" ~ switch($prev.flip);
  }

</pre></code></p><p>
  Running it:
</p>

<p><code><pre>$ ./01-string-smart 5
S0 = ""

S5 = "0010011000110110001001110011011"
</pre></code></p><h3>A Perl Version</h3><p>
  Perl does not have <code>gather</code>/<code>take</code>, but a loop works fine:

Here's why it's so important and some top tips for getting it right</em></h2><p id="viewer-4b9mf">BY KONRAD KWIATKOWSKI</p><p id="viewer-amrdb">Packaging used to be seen as nothing more than a&nbsp;necessity, a layer to protect the product inside and to transport it from A to B. Manufacturers didn’t pay much attention to branding simply because there wasn’t an expectation from the customer.&nbsp;</p><p id="viewer-5i2i">Fortunately, as a great man once said, the&nbsp;times they are changing and, used well, product packaging can play a pivotal role in the selling process.</p><p id="viewer-6j6fn">Product packaging plays a crucial role in the development of any company and its marketing strategy. Thanks to new opportunities emerging in the industry, a simple cardboard box has become a communication channel and a silent salesman as brands look to engage and entertain customers.</p><p id="viewer-8uu3k">But it wasn’t always like this. Branded boxes have gained importance due to changes in the business environment. Start-ups, entrepreneurs, people running home businesses and side hustles - these were companies with modest budgets but huge ambitions. Their charismatic leaders, with a passion for aesthetics, drove the popularity of branded packaging. A box in the hands of the right person is<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/sep/30/packaging-product-retail-success" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a>a fantastic tool and bigger, more established, companies soon realised they could get in on the action.</p><h2 id="viewer-50rh5">What makes packaging so important?</h2><p id="viewer-cnq4s">Consider a retail brand that sells women’s clothes. It opens a store, but the majority of its sales still take place online. The company might have a comprehensive marketing plan and run several annual campaigns to emphasize its USPs, but finds it’s still competing with dozens of similar retailers who are using the exact same tactics.</p><p id="viewer-de6b7">Packaging is one way retailers can stand out from the crowd. Depending on your audience, it might involve a clean, minimalist cardboard box or something with a vivid print inside. It’s also an opportunity to surprise or entertain a customer. Personalized packaging might encourage customers to share a photo on their social channels for example too. Ultimately, you want to achieve a situation where customers want to buy the packaging alone,<a href="https://packhelp.com/packvertising-the-emerging-trend-of-marketing-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://packhelp.com/packvertising-the-emerging-trend-of-marketing-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because it looks so great</a>.</p><div id="viewer-3idda"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.aliaworld.com/post/the-importance-of-product-packaging-branding" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/11062b_16f2b336c87b4d34b1e2dfbe42cd07fa~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_4000,h_3000,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/11062b_16f2b336c87b4d34b1e2dfbe42cd07fa~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><h2 id="viewer-aor04">The importance of branding</h2><p id="viewer-asm3c">Packaging is also an opportunity to tell customers who you are as a brand and what you believe in. Product packaging cannot scream at the customer - “buy me!”. It needs to be intriguing, create a mood and prompt a range of emotions. Crucially, it needs to provoke the customer to think about the brand beyond its product. Is it young and dynamic or seeped in heritage and tradition? Does the brand adopt an eco-friendly approach? What are its core values in general?</p><p id="viewer-7da9f">Additionally, think about packaging as a communication channel. Some retail companies use stickers and labels to provide information about the product, or to point customers towards social channels. An artisan chocolatier or florist, for example, may place a hand-written message inside the box if the order is celebrating a special occasion.&nbsp;</p><p id="viewer-9bh5i">It’s all a matter of “<em>how to do it</em>”, rather than asking “<em>is it worth doing it?</em>”.</p><h2 id="viewer-c4kos">Top tips to create the best packaging design:</h2><ol><li id="viewer-fsba1"><p>Keep packaging eye-catching&nbsp;so that it immediately stands out and is remembered by the customer.</p></li><li id="viewer-drqav"><p>Remember, your choice of packaging is an extension of your brand and needs to prompt an emotion</p></li><li id="viewer-17ej5"><p>Make sure packaging is durable so that it secures merchandise&nbsp;and protects the product inside</p></li><li id="viewer-9fqkk"><p>Finally, it needs to be easy to open.

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a> is a native WebGPU implementation in Rust, developed by <a href="https://gfx-rs.github.io/">gfx-rs</a> community with help of Mozilla. It’s still an emerging technology, and it has many users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gecko and Servo - for implementing WebGPU in the browsers</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a> - for using idiomatically from Rust</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/">wgpu-native</a> - for using from C language and others binding to C (<a href="https://nest.pijul.com/porky11/wgpu">Scopes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py">Python</a>, even <a href="https://github.com/cshenton/WebGPU.jl">Julia</a>), striving for C header compatibility with <a href="https://dawn.googlesource.com/">Dawn</a> via the shared <a href="https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers">webgpu-headers</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the diversity of platforms and configurations it runs, and the variety of users, the questions of reproducing issues, debugging, and testing the implementation were critical to resolve.</p>

<h2 id="prior-art">Prior art</h2>

<p>Fortunately, I had some success in the past rolling out serialization-based infrastructures for capturing and testing complex pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="gfx-rs-warden">gfx-rs Warden</h3>

<p>First, it was <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/pull/1589">Warden test framework</a> in <code>gfx-rs</code>. It defined serializable types for all of <code>gfx-rs</code> commands, and also allowed describing different scenes, test-cases, and expectations. All the data was hand-written in <a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">RON</a> format, which by the time was quite young, and not used anywhere seriously. The ability to test <code>gfx-rs</code> without code was very exciting to us, and in general it worked out OK. In the end, we haven’t written too many tests, mostly because we aggressively tested with Vulkan CTS (over <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability">gfx-portability</a>) instead, which was enormous. The separation of scenes and workloads also ended up with a few gotchas and a less-than-elegant implementation. It was also a bit awkward to write the implicit synchronization code in Warden for grabbing back the results, or re-initializing the state between tests.</p>

<h3 id="webrender-capturing">WebRender capturing</h3>

<p>The other related project was done in WebRender: the <a href="http://kvark.github.io/webrender/debug/ron/2018/01/23/wr-capture-infra.html">capturing infrastructure</a>. The purpose of this one was different: assist in reproducing and debugging issues. It serialized the pipeline at two different stages to disk, allowing the capture to be transferred to a different computer and reproduced in a simple standalone tool we called <a href="https://github.com/servo/webrender/tree/b14b5fe6db3d140c83ca10d9ca8f2fcadb7b8c13/wrench">Wrench</a>. The beauty of it is that we’d mess with the RON files by hands: remove items, or whole files, change values, just playing around and seeing how the problem reacts. Even if something goes off-rails, and your capture fails to replay, it was often possible to tweak it into a working state.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a huge success, and it became an indispensable tool in the arsenal of Firefox graphics team. Reproducing a bug in Firefox was half the problem, debugging it within Firefox was another half. The capturing infra solved both. However, I wanted to do more with it: I wanted to have a “portable” representation of a WR scene defined with a conversion to the regular WR scene. With this, we’d be able to route all the reftests through it, replacing the hand-parsed YAML format. This part of the story never happened - there were (and still are) more important things to do.</p>

<h2 id="wgpu-tracereplay">wgpu trace/replay</h2>

<p>Now, <code>wgpu</code> is fresh from the oven, and I wanted to roll in something as the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>First problem was the incoming flow of bugs reported by users of <code>wgpu-rs</code>, users of Python API, users of Gecko, on different platforms, with closed source code, and so on. Reproducing these issues and debugging them was quite challenging. We figured that <code>wgpu</code> was the place where all the roads met, and we needed to serialize everything that reaches that intersection, to be replayed independently, on a different machine. We defined a <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/619">serialization format</a> that we’d save all the incoming commands into at <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#device-timeline">device timeline</a>. We introduced a standalone “player” tool to replay the traces, which once again were stored as RON files.</p>

<p>With this in, all we needed from a bug reporter was a zipped API trace attached to an issue, and a git revision of the code they used. WebGPU is truly a <em>portable</em> GPU API, so the captures are easy to replay on a different machine. This is very unlike low-level traces, such as Vulkan traces, or Metal GPU captures - replaying them mostly did <em>not</em> work (your hardware has different limits, different memory types, features, etc). And there was nothing to do if it failed, unlike with our API traces, where you could just look at RON itself and nudge it to work. All in all, working with bugs became joyful, but we didn’t stop there.</p>

<p>Another glaring problem was that <code>wgpu</code> repository didn’t have any means to test itself. Originally, all of <code>wgpu</code>, <code>wgpu-core</code>, and <code>wgpu-native</code> were a part of the same repository, so we had the examples to check if the changes were sane. But when it was time to integrate into Gecko, we wanted to minimize the code that <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/">mozilla-central</a> needs to vendor, so we moved everything but the core logic out into separate repositories. Rust does wonders with “if it compiles, it works” motto, but riding without any tests was still an insane idea. Requiring the developers to coordinate patches with multiple repositories, just so they can prove the changes still work, started hurting our productivity.</p>

<p>To resolve this, we implemented a Rust integration test with a simple <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/803">description of tests and expectations</a>. With just a little bit of magic, we made it so <code>cargo test</code> casually enumerates the supported GPU backends on the developer’s machine, and runs the tests through it. The tests are described in the same RON format as API traces: they are basically sequences of actions, be it resource creation, or command submission. I call it “player-based GPU testing”, or “playtest” for short. I don’t know how far we are going to go with them, given that WebGPU API is being developed with it’s own CTS (which we’ll be able to run via browsers or NodeJS bindings to <code>wgpu-native</code>). At the very least, we’d want to cover the features in <code>wgpu-rs</code> <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/tree/8e4d0015862507027f3a6bd68056c64568d11366/examples#feature-matrix">example matrix</a>, to allow developers feel safe when landing patches in <code>wgpu</code>.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>Personally, I’m hugely excited for this <code>wgpu</code> infrastructure for tracing and playtesting. It’s very powerful, and it covers a lot of ground. However, it’s still early days, and there is a few rough corners and limitations.</p>

<p>One of the most annoying thing about the serialization format is <code>bitflags</code>. We use them aggressively in both <code>wgpu</code> and <code>gfx-rs</code>. Today, we have to use numerical representations of them, e.g. <code>usage: (bits: 0x41)</code>, which is neither readable or writable. I hacked a <a href="https://github.com/kvark/bitflags-serial">small wrapper</a> around <code>bitflags</code> a while ago to serialize it nicely, e.g. <code>[VERTEX | MAP_READ]</code>. Still trying to figuring out the best way to approach this (upstream <a href="https://github.com/bitflags/bitflags/issues/147">issue</a>)…</p>

<p>Another interesting feature could be to test for exact errors. WebGPU group decided to not require the implementations to report specified errors (and instead, just throw more generic errors with a string description), based on experience with WebGL where this introduced unnecessary complexity. We want stronger guarantees in <code>wgpu</code> though, so being able to test the exact error variants would totally make sense even in the presence of upstream CTS.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to use this technology more :)</p>

<p>Innovation in today’s technology is mostly around Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its sub topics such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). There is a primary focus on NLP and ML among all the tech companies. This is for a good reason. Tech companies are using NLP and ML in various aspects of their offerings and trying to stay ahead of their respective competitors.</p>



<h3 id="&quot;a-magic-compiler&quot;">A Magic Compiler</h3>



<p>With all of this going on, I feel like NLP &amp; ML will greatly impact the future of programming and programming languages. It could be possible to create a programming language out of pure English (or any language for that matter) grammar. Alright, stay with me here for a second; the way it could work is:</p>



<ul><li>The programmer would write what they want to achieve in English<code>Store user data such as name, age, sex, address and favorites in the database and create an endpoint that exposes this data securely</code></li><li>Using NLP, the compiler parses this information and creates or uses the existing <code>User</code> class and stores the user attributes such as <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, <code>sex</code>, <code>address</code> and <code>favorites</code></li><li>The compiler keeps correcting itself over the extended usage of the programming language using ML. The compiler figures out the datatype of the attribute. For ex: <code>name</code> is a <code>String</code>. <code>age</code> is an <code>Integer</code>. Since the attribute is named <code>favorites</code>, it figures that it’s a collection of <code>String</code>s. Since the programmer instructed the compiler to expose an endpoint with the data securely, we get an <code>https</code> endpoint to access the resource.</li></ul>



<p>The programmer can then do something like –<br><code>Every user has many photos. Store those photos in Amazon's S3 (maybe) bucket</code></p>



<p>A programming language like this could become a reality. Of course, this is a massive over-simplification of things, but, it could be possible. I mean, if human beings are capable of making computers perform intellectual tasks, this could totally be possible.</p>



<p>This can also be taken one step further and use speech to text conversion. Programmers can then just speak what they want to build and have the compiler write the code for them.</p>



<p>The advantage to creating something like this is extensibility. Imagine if every person who can speak a language can write code? Any person that can read/write a language, ends up being able to write plugins/extensions/modules in their language and contribute. There’s a lot of smart people out there and this programming model extends their creativity. Right now, it’s just a missed opportunity. It would be amazing to see what people do with their “newly acquired” skill.</p>



<h3 id="&quot;domain-specific-languages-dsl&quot;">Domain-specific languages (DSL)</h3>



<p>Today, one can do something remotely similar by using Domain-specific languages (DSLs). But, DSLs are very restricted and don’t offer much in terms of flexibility in their usage. Hence, a proper implementation to support the above mentioned features would be required.</p>



<p>This would be a very interesting project to work on. I will continue research around this subject and see if I can come up with a trivial implementation of this.</p>

But it all plays an important role in how much the system smells, how much documentation is missing, and what a given developer does in their day-to-day. By understanding the concept one can attempt to mitigate it. But some people may be programming for 8 hours a day, not documenting a thing, and unknowingly increasing the maintenance costs of the system for everyone who will ever work on the system.</p>
<p>These are the most common misconceptions about a programmer’s life:</p>
<ol>
<li>You program 8 hours a day at work</li>
<li>A program is about programming</li>
<li>Since I wrote the code, my opinion matters most</li>
<li>The program matters</li>
<li>Every software shop is the same</li>
<li>We’ll rewrite everything</li>
<li>I only have to understand one programming language</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>You program 8 hours a day at work</strong></h4>
<p>This is probably the least true of all the things. Most programming jobs are maintenance jobs. The programs have all mostly been written years ago, and you are doing support, minor enhancements, bug fixes. Even if you get to do more than that, you are still not likely coding a large part of your day. It’s about meetings to decide what to do. This is probably one of the most common misconceptions about a programmer’s life.</p>
<p>Also, from my experience, unless you have some reason to dig deep into code (esp. if the code base is large), most people don’t bother. Our codebase is old and rickety. There aren’t any comments. The business process isn’t exactly documented. I don’t want to wade through 2000 lines of Java code (per Java file) and try to understand the business behind it.</p>
<p>Unless you’re working in a brand new project that needs a lot of code written (which I’ve been in), you are probably not doing a lot of programming.</p>

<h4><strong>A program is about programming</strong></h4>
<p>I work at a university. Students, esp. computer science students, complain about our old system that runs a “batch style” programming system. That is, the system shuts down overnight, does a bunch of data processing, and opens again in the morning. They wonder why the system can’t be Facebook or Google or YouTube and be up 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>First, I think many such people would be surprised how many people (or really, how few people) are supporting these systems. You’d think there’s a team of 20 developers doing the best they can to keep this stuff running, and it’s like a well-oiled machine, but sometimes it’s less than half a dozen people, and we barely know the software’s purpose, but can do minor fixes and keep stuff running.</p>
<p>Most software out there isn’t, as they say, rocket science. Sure, a few exceptions (say, SpaceX software). Most of the software encodes business practices, and most business practices are a weird arcane set of rules that have no basis in math or science but is just how some company works. You write that in code, no matter how illogical it is. And often, the code and a few old-timers’ memories are what holds the project together.</p>
<p>Definitely one of the most common misconceptions about a programmer’s life.</p>

<h5>Programmers had one purpose: get the program to work.</h5>
<p>Comments? Hah! A written business process? Hah! Programmers had one purpose: get the program to work. They didn’t think about who would maintain the code after they retired. The only saving grace was their background wasn’t so sophisticated as to create true spaghetti code (let’s use regular expressions and finite state machines and design patterns up the wazoo!).</p>
<p>It’s often not the coding language (like Cobol) that prevents modernization (although it’s partly that), it’s that the business process was never formalized, and there are 100,000 lines of code no one wants to read (and only represents an&nbsp;<em>approximation</em>&nbsp;of what the people who wanted the code wanted—and they’re retired too!).</p>
<p>I often point out the scene in the third Matrix movie where the councilman is talking to Neo about how these machines support their underground city, yet no one quite knows who built it or how it works. That’s a lot of software out there.</p>

<p>Writing from scratch is not such a common experience (at least, from my perspective), and even when you do, it’s not always as organized as it could be. We may call it software engineering, but most engineering involves others looking at your work, and having input into fixing it. Code reviews aren’t the same thing as people inspecting a building and seeing it every day.</p>
<p>We often don’t rewrite things because the rewrite would be huge, would require a bunch of new developers, and doesn’t even have the support of the people we’re writing it for.</p>
<h4><strong>As a programmer, since I wrote the code, my opinion is the most important</strong></h4>
<p>OK, so you may&nbsp;<em>know</em> to program, but do you know the business you’re working in? Many a programmer or startup guy thinks “You guys do something dumb, and I’m smart, so I can easily create a system that’s 10 times better than the crap you use. And you know what? I’m not even going to consult you about how the system&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;work. I’ll make up my own. You are such&nbsp;<em>idiots</em>!”.</p>
<p>Well, that maybe, but they’re used to the system they are used to, and they’ve thought about their own (arcane) business process for a long time, and if you build something that is completely different from what they are used to, they won’t say “oh, we lack the intellect to understand your truly great software”, they’ll just not use your software.</p>
<p>If your user base is a bit older, and possibly, even if they aren’t, they will be used to doing things in a certain way. Maybe you can convince them that way isn’t smart, but if they questioned your lack of comments, your lack of coding structure, how what you wrote seems like gibberish, you might get defensive as well. This is also one of the most common misconceptions about a programmer’s life.</p>
<p>The point is that you’re often writing software or maintaining software by those who use the software every day. As a programmer, you might even have the luxury to walk away after you write code, never having used the code as your users use them, and they may ultimately hire someone new who maybe pays attention to what they actually want, even if you think it makes no sense.</p>
<h4><strong>The program matters</strong></h4>
<p>Many of you are learning to program. You think companies are willing to throw out a million line codebase because it’s&nbsp;<em>written in an obsolete language</em>. Who’s going to write it? You? (You, Mr. Wineburg?)</p>
<p>A million lines of code is something that could take a lifetime to rewrite. Do you plan to read the code to understand what it does? Could you even do that?</p>
<p>In any case, sometimes people think the program is king (or queen, or some elected position). It’s not.</p>
<p>It’s the data.</p>
<p>Say you’ve run this legacy program for more than a decade. It fills up tables and tables of data. You, being a person who hates legacy code, wants new DB tables, and new ways of storing information.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem. What do you do with all those old data? Oh, you want to throw it out? Start new? <em>Brilliant!</em></p>
<h4><a href="https://expertain.net/the-best-way-to-learn-how-to-code/">You might also like: The best way to learn how to code</a></h4>
<h4><strong>Every software shop is the same</strong></h4>
<p>If you look at the world of practicing doctors, they seem to fall (roughly) into two categories: those working in hospitals on patients that need somewhat urgent care (or are doing elective surgery), and doctors with private practices. One of the most common misconceptions about a programmer’s life (and the weirdest one!).</p>
<p>Both seem to follow a similar structure so that if you went from one personal care doctor to another, their structure would be about the same (waiting room, receptionist, files, someone to check your insurance, collect your copay). If you go get your car repaired at a mechanic, you expect a similar experience. If you go to a grocery store, you expect a similar experience.</p>
<p>People in the software industry have nothing close to this. Each company may have widely varying setups. There are companies with just one program that does everything. Could you run a grocery store with just one person? (Well, maybe if it’s a tiny one-person operation selling very few items). Or a doctor’s office (probably not because of insurances, unless you’re some kind of boutique doctor that makes home visits, and even then, I suspect you hire someone to do the billing, etc).</p>
<h5>The big companies can afford to have their own internal support structure that makes it easier for their average developer to deploy code.</h5>
<p>That support structure is often an internal thing, not an off-the-shelf, any small company can do it. If you were a car mechanic and wanted to open your own small shop, you’d probably know exactly what you need (at least, the very basics). These things probably have been (roughly) the same for decades, and even the new things, people probably generally agree on what is needed.</p>
<p>But if you’re a small software shop…there’s no such standards. Do you want to use Atlassian tools? Or do you use a spreadsheet or emails? Do you use some kind of company email? Or do you use personal email? There are lots of decisions, and it’s hardly standardized in the industry.</p>
<p>You may think, say, version control is important. I guarantee there’s some software out there (maybe rare), that doesn’t use standard version control, and it probably does something important. And the people maintaining it may not even understand what version control is and why you need it. I’m serious.</p>
<p>It’s like going to a surgeon with a bottle of whiskey and a bowl of leeches and they say “What’s anesthetic?”</p>
<h4><strong>We’ll rewrite everything!</strong></h4>

        <div>

  

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

You can do so with the default URL that Zappa creates for you and once you are done with this, you can then buy a short domain and route all requests coming to that domain to this URL in the DNS settings of your domain provider.</p><p><strong>How does El Chapo work?</strong><br></p><p>El Chapo uses AWS DynamoDB as the data store to save the following information:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li>Short URL path</li><li>Original URL</li><li>Webhook URL.</li></ol><p>DynamoDB is a very efficient and cheap key value data store that is capable of handling requests at the rate of even 20 million per second. It is also fully managed with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>We did not even end up deleting old shortened URLs from DynamoDB because it doesn’t cost us anything to keep it. However if you want to expire and delete old entries, you can do so easily since DynamoDB supports a TTL for entries in the database.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Now that the data store is established, the working of this application is quite straight forward. When a request is received to create a new short URL path, an entry is created in the database with the above 3 fields and when someone clicks on the short URL, they are redirected to the original URL and in parallel if a webhook is defined, it is called. That is pretty much it.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To make this process even simpler, dynamo DB has a python SDK that you can use to define a model in your database the same way you would do if you had access to an ORM.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Further documentation about the inner workings of the application are defined in the <a href="https://github.com/sankalpjonn/elchapo" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> mentioned earlier.</p><p><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></p><p>Since I mentioned multiple times that this solution is very cheap to maintain, let me back up that claim with some numbers.&nbsp; In the month of June, we had 73K read requests and 914K write requests on DynamoDB. The cost for this came to be 1.16$</p><figure id="w-node-6fb9429262ba-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f13d2c85a496bbf637792c9_5FEQDV_cI-hQHUumzw_42I71nBrhTaGh2dXmHzHzOWlP5HhoZaDuVZHwqxPxJAaBxWFPcPwvhCOAdBa2Hg16lJeS82XyNbxlB_9obJTs3yQVWSPPhMsFLgWiX4JwXy2C4xH30EeC.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Cost of DynamoDB</figcaption></figure><p>And as for Lamdba, we made 1.16 Million requests out of which about 1 million were under free tier, so the cost for this was 0.04$</p><figure id="w-node-d996c3838604-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f13d2c928d180ac87c5b525_U2FtsU6aVlSrjDxchwitUPHJ9E3UBcviMHa7M_zNloUPfcCFs2Lz9NKkspBwUiRkTsoVqdkhQia1P4UFYpu24I3cfcVNJVfkslglBfQE89CgiYIKMAyhTYHe4tipLgYtOUJ-beip.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Cost of Lambda</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the API gateway charges came to be 3.73$</p><figure id="w-node-45f3c8f9f34f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f13d2c89065455440f33603__pGDvekprXPFJwAwf4_Ixy0bklY9WDP0EfAhXiLhytZTT_nWyddqAxCaKlKL2AD4nQrfACp9l--u0xBYpqOk_MNHKsbQlZddun3B2aUUZIuUZLW5c4p25ApmIJClF6qWeVwQBEjp.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Cost of API&nbsp;Gateway</figcaption></figure><p>So the total cost for serving &gt; 1mn requests using this setup cost us around $5 which is not zero but it is pretty close to zero considering our MRR and volume.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>One of the great weaknesses of many of the tools we use to collaborate on ideas and discuss ideas is the soft form of feedback and critique. When the author or the publisher comments on a blog post, he or she is mostly engaging in public feedback. The author writes a note to his or her audience for the reasons why he or she thinks that idea is great. The audience usually thinks back to a previous comment that they made about a related issue, and thereby some form of collective social check-in is taking place. Over time, the author builds up more and more of a story about the author’s experience with the idea.</p><p>Yet the collection of data for sharing ideas is primarily a mechanical one. It’s easy to churn out a blog post or a creative response to an issue after a quick exchange of ideas. But it is important to remember that few of us actually feel we have anything special to contribute. We may have an opinion on what a picture should look like on the cover of a magazine or we know how a new kind of spider should be executed. And sometimes, these opinions are constructive. But more often, we do not want to be kind of clashing opinions. We want to express our experience to make a less-romantic point.</p><p>For that reason, there are two kinds of feedback. The first kind is the simple word-and-comment exchange. Feedback loops are self-regulating mechanisms that involve social feedback to adjust the original feedback algorithm.</p><p>Wired has done a good job explaining how a social feedback loop works. This is essentially what people do when they read another person’s column. But social feedback may have different definitions than the blunt word-and-comment threads. Consider an app, the Daily Reminder, that sends a quick message when your email inbox gets filled up with messages. The feedback loop in this case is lower-tech: You automatically send a message to yourself and it is turned into a feedback loop. The system then alerts you to any future stuff you should check out. If you don’t want to hear from someone else, you can delete the alert in your smartphone. But the feedback loop is very well designed, because it always picks up on your way of thinking.</p><p>Fully digital, this feels like contact with your friends, but it is primarily a feedback loop. These micro-feedback loops are quite effective: They are often the best way to encourage people to engage with new ideas. And they can help humanize the hierarchy of information sharing. The buttons at the bottom of forums remind people to reply and comment. Commenting is an activity you engage in once in a while, one that makes sense in the larger experience of online conversation.</p><p>Yet you don’t want to spend your time performing the feedback loop — not to a great extent, anyway. Ultimately, it is only a means to an end, and once you have processed all the data for a given instance, there is nothing to post to. Some of us react strongly to social feedback loops because they feel very rewarding, because we are invited to see ourselves as individual “experts” in our online experiences.</p><p>There is a term for this kind of self-regulating feedback loop. Many times in science, it is called “Ablation.” A dissenter or opponent will be informed of your thinking by you, as he or she reaps the rewards. This can be embarrassing for the person who gives the feedback, but the feedback is actually more rewarding than the person who initially contributed the information. After all, it makes it clear that their original ideas are incorrect. At least this is how some of them look.</p><p>Some of us respond to feedback loops with a visible irritation. Others are more willing to confront those we disagree with on issues. Sometimes I would like to ask people to keep their criticisms of ideas to themselves. But they are worried that I am taking up so much space in the text, and that if they responded, my readers would be frustrated and turn on them. So, they speak up.</p><p>The upshot is that some of us like to see our views and ideas being debated openly. This is not necessarily a bad thing. As someone who does not feel all of my ideas are created equal, I also want to see constructive disagreements.</p><p>But at the end of the day, the best way to harness the power of social feedback loops is to choose which ideas you want to add to them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>On May 21, Brittany Chavez had just about reached her limits.</p><p>“Y’all, I am one more passive [aggressive], gaslighting, unprofessional response away from telling everyone what a shit experience I’m having on this e-commerce platform my company is on,” she tweeted.</p><div id="piano-cta">
<p>While cryptic, those within her circle knew what she was talking about. Chavez had spent the last five months building her online marketplace, Shop Latinx, on the startup e-commerce platform Elliot. During those months, she hyped the company on multiple social media platforms. In turn, Shop Latinx was used in marketing materials about Elliot; Chavez said she had even been asked to speak about her experience with Elliot investors Torch Capital.</p>

<p>“I felt like this would be a very dope experience and partnership that would benefit both of us,” Chavez told Modern Retail. Instead, she found herself increasingly frustrated by the limitations — dealing with small technical problems that she said the company would take months to fix, if not completely ignore the requests.</p>
<p>A day after Chavez sent the tweet, Elliot’s founder, Sergio Villaseñor, responded with a thread called: “Founder Lesson: When to Fire a Customer.” He posted financial documents and emails sent between him, Chavez and another Shop Latinx co-founder. He included personal and financial allegations about the company’s revenue, claiming to have paid for her laptop and wiring her cash to help her incorporate. It concluded: “As a Latino, it’s unfortunate to terminate a customer that supports a community I’m racially bound to.”</p>
<p>It was a strange ordeal, made ugly by the online public setting. Even stranger was the fact that Elliot had not even gone to market yet, and Shop Latinx was one of its beta testers. Three weeks before he was supposed to unveil his e-commerce platform, Villaseñor had decided to put an early adopter on blast.</p>
<p>This was perhaps a harbinger of what was to come. Villaseñor and his founders spent months hyping their soon-to-launch platform. The launch, however, never happened, as the platform, according to sources, seemed largely untested despite much handwaving and claims made online, in industry groups and to the merchants already signed on. Elliot, the pitch went, was going to be the anti-Shopify — an international e-commerce platform that focused on smaller businesses in an increasingly globalized world. But the competitive landscape was already crowded with giants like BigCommerce, WooCommerce and Magento offering similar solutions.</p>
<p>Despite being small, Elliot represented an important shift in the e-commerce space. It was a back-end company trying to brand itself as hip, current and with the times. Where Magento was an agnostic platform that seemed invisible to everyone but the engineers and developers, Elliot was riding the direct to consumer wave of marketing coming first and product being second. The problem for Elliot, it seemed, was that product never quite got to where it said it should be.</p>

<p>But for at least a few months, the guerilla campaigning worked. Thanks to advertising placements in industry newsletters like Lean Luxe, myriad Twitter threads about hustling and entrepreneurship (as well as quite a few online spats), the commerce industry took notice, more investors began writing checks, and e-commerce professionals’ interests were getting piqued.</p>
<p>Elliot’s launch date was set for June 18. When the day came, due to what the company claimed was a denial of service attack on its infrastructure, the unveiling hit some snags. In response to the alleged attack, sources said Villaseñor fired most of the company’s engineers — many of whom were on contract with the company Andela, which hires coders in Africa, including in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. (Villaseñor contested this, saying that the engineers’ contracts ended that day and he was in the process of hiring full-time staff.) He then announced on Twitter that Elliot’s launch would be pushed until December 25. A few days later, he would announce that he was stepping down as CEO of the company. And 24 hours after that, his two other co-founders, Marco Marandiz and Clayton Chambers, announced that the company would shut down completely.</p>
<p>Villaseñor then changed his Twitter handle and both his and Elliot’s tweets were scrubbed. Marandiz and Chambers posted on Twitter that they are no longer associated with the company. Marandiz declined to comment for this article and Chambers did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Villaseñor has tried to keep a low profile. In a private Discord chat viewed by Modern Retail, third-party developers expressed disbelief at the outcome; Many were disappointed to learn the news about Elliot’s closing via Twitter, not via internal networks. “These guys may be on to something, market the shit out of product and then dip with the investor money,” wrote one member. When asked what happened, Villaseñor simply said he was too exhausted; “I was burnt out when I started Elliot,” he wrote on the Discord. “I just got tired.”</p>
<p>Now, a few days later, Villaseñor told Modern Retail the show isn’t over. “We are recapitalizing the company under a new name,” he said, adding that the details are still being worked out. He is the only member of the board. The company is now just him and a team of five engineers trying to pick back up the pieces, he said. Stepping down, he said, was part of the overall strategy. “We will set out a launch date later in the year — when we feel the platform is secure,” he said. “I will still be loosely involved.”</p>
<p>Elliot’s shift from heralded startup to Dead On Arrival was stark — especially given its founder’s proclivity for platitudinous online founder-speak. On June 9, Villaseñor tweeted:</p>

<p>He was the ultimate online operator and hype man. He and his most recent co-founders had spent months teasing the launch of their new company. They tweeted, posted videos and hosted luxurious dinners and exotic getaways — all to get more people talking about Elliot. They also focused specifically on smaller, more diverse brands — claiming to offer e-commerce support for companies that are often overlooked. This was what helped attract a slew of industry operators and entrepreneurs who have historically felt ignored; a back-end e-commerce platform suddenly had brand evangelists. The pitch focused on diversity and industry shortcomings. And it certainly resonated, at least for a while.</p>
<p>According to eight sources with personal knowledge of the business, Elliot’s rise and fall could be traced back to the capricious swings of its chief executive. Villaseñor spent the last year trying to build and hype his platform, specifically seeking out diverse and popular brand evangelists. But the platform was never finished, and not as international as it claimed to be; it facilitated payments through Stripe, for example, which is only supported in 33 countries. (Villaseñor said that it is working to add payment options and that it offers a wallet feature where merchants in countries that Stripe doesn’t operate can connect their bank accounts to receive payments directly from Elliot.)</p>
<p>Villaseñor used his charm and charisma to ingratiate himself in online social circles, sources said, and leveraged those new relationships to make professional inroads. Through this, he landed investment dollars and business partnerships, which helped propel his social media following and professional clout. “It’s very appalling to me to see someone get the opportunity that so many people crave — all that funding, and then blow it up,” said Andrea Hernández, founder of Mood Food Snacks, a Latin America-based company that was courted to use Elliot earlier this year.</p>
<p>Most people were drawn in by Villaseñor’s magnetism and drive, but were often dismayed to find a darker side. If a potential business partner gave him an answer he didn’t like, he would call them, angry, or take to Twitter to blast their replies. “It was these violent switches in personality,” said one person who had done business with the platform. People in Villaseñor’s crosshairs would often have to message co-founders or investors to get him to stop. “It’s scary,” the source said.</p>
<p>In Villaseñor’s eyes, the idea was to get people’s attention. “Our Twitter persona,” he said, “was very intentional.” There were a lot of competitors, and they all had serious marketshare. It didn’t make sense in his eyes to pay for search and social media marketing. “We were leading with bravado,” he said. “That would allow us to make some noise and get attention.”</p>
<p><strong>How did it get here?</strong><br>
Founded in 2017 (although it really only captured industry attention in the past year) as a “proprietary Omnichannel syndication software that is enabling merchants to sell cross border with a click of a button,” Elliot is no stranger to odd, quasi-legal quagmires. For example, in 2019 (when Villaseñor was in the midst of its latest relaunch) Elliot sued an early business partner named Derek Sine for allegedly illegally using the Elliot trademark and making fraudulent claims. In multiple legal back-and-forths, Sine claimed to be a co-founder.</p>
<p>In 2018, the company announced a $3 million seed rounding along with a new set of executives, including Lea Solimene, Joey Spanjers and Hass Johnson. (Today, none of these people list Elliot on their LinkedIn profiles and none responded to requests for comment for this article.) The press release at the time focused less on the branding and more on the set of tools it provided including “data management, global shipping options, translations, and all the tools needed to connect to billions of new consumers.”</p>
<p>Over a year went by, and Elliot never launched. Villaseñor said that company was about to sign a Series A term sheet, but the team “didn’t feel like the product would be sustainable.” He decided to pivot the original business away from being a “catalog manager,” and rebrand entirely. The team at the time “didn’t fit the …</p></div></div>

<p>I don't like reading thick O'Reilly books when I start learning new programming languages. Rather, I like starting by writing small and dirty code. If you take this approach, having many simple code examples are extremely helpful because I can find answers to these questions very easily.</p>

<p><em>How can I define a function?</em></p>

<p><em>What's the syntax for if and else?</em></p>

<p><em>Does the language support string interpolation?</em></p>

<p><em>What scopes of variables are available?</em></p>

<p>These are very basic questions, but enough to start hacking with the new languages.</p>



<p>Recently, I needed to learn this completely new language <strong>Clojure</strong> but couldn't find what I wanted. So, I decided to create one while learning Clojure.</p>

<p>Clojure is a functional programming language and learning functional programming languages is sometimes hard if you've only had experiences with imperative languages. I have paid careful attention to make this page easy to understand for people who don't have experiences with functional programming languages, so please don't hesitate to read this page even if you don't know anything about functional programming.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this page helps you learning functional programming and starting to write Clojure!</p>

<p>Our first Clojure code is, of course, printing "Hello, world!". Here, we invoke the <strong>function</strong> <code>println</code> with the <strong>argument</strong> <code>Hello, world!</code>. We call the invocation of function <strong><em>applying the function to data</em></strong> in Clojure or other functional programming language.</p>



<p>The entire line of the code <code>(....)</code> is called a <strong>form</strong> in Clojure. It's also called <strong>expression</strong> in a general sense, but there is no real problem to use them interchangeably.</p>

<p>You can think of form as something that returns a value. <code>"h"</code> <code>100</code> <code>true</code> are all forms as well.</p>

<p>Giving names to values is called <strong>assignment</strong> in many programming languages. However, we call the mapping between names and values  <strong>binding</strong> in Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="symbol">Symbol</h2>
<p>Symbols are used to bind names to values. <code>a</code> <code>b</code> <code>my-cool-function</code> <code>nyncat</code>: they are all symbols in Clojure.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>'a</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>clojure.lang.Symbol</span><span>

</span><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>'b</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>clojure.lang.Symbol</span><span>

</span><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>'my-cool-function</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>clojure.lang.Symbol</span><span>

</span><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>'nyncat</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>clojure.lang.Symbol</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p><code>'</code> will prevent a form from being evaluated. We are doing this here because we want to treat symbols as data in order to pass them to <code>type</code> function.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"aaaaa"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>'user/a</span><span>

</span><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>aaaaa</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>

</span><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>CompilerException</span><span> </span><span>java.lang.RuntimeException</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Unable</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>resolve</span><span> </span><span>symbol</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span> </span><span>context,</span><span> </span><span>compiling</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>NO_SOURCE_PATH</span><span>:1:1</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>If you don't prepend a <code>'</code> single quote, you are telling Clojure to resolve the symbol. You can obtain bound values by resolving symbols.</p>



<p>When we try to resolve symbols that are not bound to anything, Clojure complains with the exception.</p>
<h2 id="let">Let</h2><pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>l</span><span> </span><span>"light"</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"God said let there be "</span><span> </span><span>l</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>God</span><span> </span><span>said</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>there</span><span> </span><span>be</span><span> </span><span>light</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>To bind values to names, use <code>let</code>. Let takes a vector which takes a symbol in the first element and a value in the second element.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>l</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>CompilerException</span><span> </span><span>java.lang.RuntimeException</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Unable</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>resolve</span><span> </span><span>symbol</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>l</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span> </span><span>context,</span><span> </span><span>compiling</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>NO_SOURCE_PATH</span><span>:1:1</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You cannot resolve the symbol outside the let. This behavior is very similar to <em>private variable</em> in other programming languages.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>l</span><span> </span><span>"light"</span><span>
             </span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>"darkness"</span><span>]</span><span>
             </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"God said let there be "</span><span> </span><span>l</span><span>))</span><span>
             </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"God also said let there be "</span><span> </span><span>d</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>God</span><span> </span><span>said</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>there</span><span> </span><span>be</span><span> </span><span>light</span><span>
</span><span>God</span><span> </span><span>also</span><span> </span><span>said</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>there</span><span> </span><span>be</span><span> </span><span>darkness</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You can also provide multiple bindings.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>l</span><span> </span><span>"light"</span><span>
            </span><span>l_d</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>l</span><span> </span><span>" and"</span><span> </span><span>" darkness"</span><span>)]</span><span>
            </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"God also said let there be "</span><span> </span><span>l_d</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>God</span><span> </span><span>also</span><span> </span><span>said</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>there</span><span> </span><span>be</span><span> </span><span>light</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>darkness</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>The binding will be immediately available, so each binding can see the prior bindings.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>When Clojure tries to resolve a symbol, the resolution will be done in the <strong>scope</strong> of the symbol.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"aaa"</span><span>]</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>))</span><span>
</span><span>aaa</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>Clojure tries to evaluate <code>a</code> because it needs to pass the value to <code>println</code>. <code>a</code> is bound to <code>"aaa"</code>, so "aaa" is printed in your terminal. Very straight forward.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"aaa"</span><span>]</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"AAA"</span><span>]</span><span>
          </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>)))</span><span>

</span><span>AAA</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>Now, <code>let</code> are nested. Like previous example, Clojure tries to resolve <code>a</code>. However, this time Clojure resolves <code>a</code> to <code>"AAA"</code>, instead of <code>aaa</code>. Each <code>let</code> will create a scope and symbol resolution is done inside the let where the symbol is resolved.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"aaa"</span><span>]</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"AAA"</span><span>]</span><span>
          </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>))</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>))</span><span>
</span><span>AAA</span><span>
</span><span>aaa</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>Also notice that the inner <code>let</code> does not override the scope of outer <code>let</code>.</p>



<p>This kind of scope is called <strong>lexical scope</strong>. For those whom English is not your first language, lexical means <em>words in a sentence</em>. The scope is <strong>lexical</strong> because the compiler relies on the physical location of the symbol (word) in a program (sentence) to resolve them.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span>]</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
          </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>a</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>The resolution look up bubbles up until it finds the binding. The inner <code>let</code> doesn't provide the binding for <code>a</code>, so it bubbles up to the outer <code>let</code>. This happens because the scope of inner let is wrapped by the scope of outer <code>let</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span>]</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
          </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>not-bound-symbol</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>CompilerException</span><span> </span><span>java.lang.RuntimeException</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Unable</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>resolve</span><span> </span><span>symbol</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>not-bound-symbol</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span> </span><span>context,</span><span> </span><span>compiling</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>NO_SOURCE_PATH</span><span>:3:11</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>Clojure complains with <strong>Unable to resolve symbol</strong> exception when it cannot find the binding inside the given scope.</p>



<p>You probably find the idea of lexical scope very familiar. This is because most modern programming languages use lexical scope. There is also something called <em>dynamic scope</em> but you probably don't have to know that right now.</p>
<h2 id="def">Def</h2><pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>object</span><span> </span><span>"light"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>'user/object</span><span>

</span><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"God said let there be "</span><span> </span><span>object</span><span>))</span><span>
</span><span>God</span><span> </span><span>said</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>there</span><span> </span><span>be</span><span> </span><span>light</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You can also bind symbols to values with <code>def</code>. While you can access the symbol only from within the <code>let</code> where it's declared , you can access the symbol declared with <code>def</code> from anywhere.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>object</span><span> </span><span>"darkness"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>'user/object</span><span>

</span><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"God said let there be "</span><span> </span><span>object</span><span>))</span><span>
</span><span>God</span><span> </span><span>said</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>there</span><span> </span><span>be</span><span> </span><span>darkness</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You can also override the one already declared later.</p>



<p>The rule of thumb in Clojure is avoiding the use of <code>def</code> as much as possible. <code>def</code> introduces state and abusing state will make our code difficult to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="defn">Defn</h2><pre><code><span>

</span><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>say-hello</span><span>
         </span><span>[</span><span>name</span><span>]</span><span>
         </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)))</span><span>

</span><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>say-hello</span><span> </span><span>"Kim"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>Hello,</span><span> </span><span>Kim</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>To define a function, use <code>defn</code>.</p>

<p>The first argument is the name of function <code>say-hello</code>, the second argument is the argument of the function <code>[name]</code>, and the third argument is the function body <code>(println (str "Hello, " name))</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>say-hello</span><span>
         </span><span>"Takes name argument and say hello to the name"</span><span>
         </span><span>[</span><span>name</span><span>]</span><span>
         </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You can also add documentation.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>doc</span><span> </span><span>say-hello</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>-------------------------</span><span>
</span><span>user/say-hello</span><span>
</span><span>([</span><span>name</span><span>])</span><span>
  </span><span>Takes</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>argument</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>say</span><span> </span><span>hello</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>Use <code>doc</code> to read the documentation.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>say-hello</span><span>
         </span><span>"Takes name argument and say hello to the name"</span><span>
         </span><span>{</span><span>:added</span><span> </span><span>"1.0"</span><span>
          </span><span>:static</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>}</span><span>
         </span><span>[</span><span>name</span><span>]</span><span>
         </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You can also add metadata of the function.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>meta</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span> </span><span>say-hello</span><span>))</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>:added</span><span> </span><span>"1.0"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:ns</span><span> </span><span>#</span><span>&lt;Namespace</span><span> </span><span>user&gt;,</span><span> </span><span>:name</span><span> </span><span>say-hello,</span><span> </span><span>:file</span><span> </span><span>"NO_SOURCE_PATH"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:static</span><span> </span><span>true,</span><span> </span><span>:column</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:line</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:arglists</span><span> </span><span>([</span><span>name</span><span>])</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:doc</span><span> </span><span>"Takes name argument and say hello to the name"</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You can expand the metadata with <code>meta</code>. Notice that <code>say-hello</code> is first passed to <code>var</code>. This is because <code>meta</code> expects it's argument to be var object, not value, and <code>var</code> will turn the passed symbol into var object.</p>
<pre><code><span>user&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>meta</span><span> </span><span>#</span><span>'say-hello</span><span>)</span><span>

</span></code></pre>


<p><code>#'</code> is the reader macro for <code>var</code> and works the exactly same.</p>
<h2 id="anonymous-function">Anonymous Function</h2>
<p>Functions are first class objects in Clojure. When you say something is <em>a first class object in programming language X</em>, it means that you can do all the basic operations with the object
such as passing it to a function, returned from a function, and binding it to a variable, etc.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span>))</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>&lt;user$eval3663$fn__3664</span><span> </span><span>user$eval3663$fn__3664</span><span>@</span><span>5</span><span>de5bfa4&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>To create a function object, use <code>fn</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>hello-world-func</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>'user/hello-world-func</span><span>

</span><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>hello-world-func</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>Hello</span><span> </span><span>world</span><span>
</span><span>nil</span><span>
</span></code></pre>


<p>You can bind functions to var just like other values. This works just like <code>defn</code></p>
<pre><code><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>#</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>&lt;user$eval2902$fn__2903</span><span> </span><span>user$eval2902$fn__2903</span><span>@</span><span>1</span><span>cc9a623&gt;</span><span>

</span><span>user=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span>

<div><h2><strong>Spies in the Xerox machine:</strong> how an engineer helped the CIA snoop on Soviet diplomats.</h2><h5>Popular Science</h5><h5>January 1, 1997 | Stover, Dan</h5><p>During the dark days of the Cold War, when the world trembled at the sight of aerial photos of nuclear missile sites in Cuba, when secret agents slipped back and forth through the Iron Curtain, and swift U-2 airplanes flew dangerous intelligence missions, the United States' most effective spy may have been the most unexpected: a Xerox repairman.</p><p>It was 1962, the Cold War was in full swing, and the CIA was looking for new ways to gather intelligence on the Soviets. Someone at the agency had realized that the one person who had easy and regular access to the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., the one American who could come and go with no questions asked, was the Xerox repairman. He visited the embassy at least once a month, and nobody was surprised or alarmed to see him tinkering with the photocopier, his tools scattered on the floor. At the CIA, this seemed like an opportunity too good to pass up.</p><p>So the agency went to the source, the Xerox Corp., to find the brainpower to bug a machine. Ray Zoppoth was a 36-year-old mechanical engineer at Xerox in Webster, New York, when he was asked to join a small team that would work on this project. For years afterward, Zoppoth kept his role secret from even his wife and his eight children. But now, he believes, it is time people learned more about this chapter in our nation's history. That's why he decided to tell his story to POPULAR SCIENCE.</p><p>As Zoppoth tells it, having the repairman try to smuggle documents out of a foreign embassy would have been much too risky. Instead, the CIA wanted the repairman to install a device that would enable its agents to view the documents being copied on the embassy's Xerox machine. They hoped such a system would not only give them a peek at top-secret Soviet documents, but that it would also tell them whether Soviet spies had managed to get their hands on any classified U.S. documents.</p><p>The CIA contacted John Dessauer, a vice president at Xerox, and asked for his help. Dessauer then put Donald Cary, who headed a government programs group at Xerox, in charge of the project. Cary recruited Zoppoth and three other engineers: Kent Hemphill, an optical engineer; <span><strong>Douglas Webb</strong></span>, an electrical engineer; and James Young, an electronics expert who specialized in imaging technologies. Zoppoth was chosen, in part, because he had helped develop the Xerox model 914, the first automatic push-button copier, and the type used in the Soviet embassy.</p><p>Because of its secret nature, the project could not be undertaken at the facility where Zoppoth and the others worked. Instead, the project leaders rented an abandoned one-lane bowling alley in a small shopping center. With the installation of a security system, the windowless alley became an impromptu research lab.</p><p>There, progress notes spread across the alley floor, the engineers experimented with several methods for imaging the documents being copied on the embassy's model 914. An approach suggested by Zoppoth seemed the most promising: Mount a battery-powered home-movie camera with a zoom lens inside the copier. Aim the lens at the mirror used to reflect images onto the drum. Add a photocell that would prompt the camera to snap still frames whenever the photocopier lit up. And start taking pictures.</p><p>The engineers purchased a state-of-the-art Bell &amp; Howell movie camera from a retail outlet. It was about seven inches long and held a spool of 8mm film. There was plenty of room for the camera deep inside the bulky console-style copier, and the camera couldn't be seen even when the machine's covers were removed. The camera's noise was drowned out by the sounds of the photocopier.</p><p>The team installed the camera in a machine at the bowling alley, and photographed sample documents. "We used the bathroom as our darkroom," Zoppoth recalls.</p><p>Next, they installed a camera in a machine at the main Xerox office in Webster. "When we developed the pictures, we found recipes and copies of music and cartoons and jokes and all kinds of things," Zoppoth says.</p><p>Finally, the engineers were ready to turn their invention over to the CIA. Zoppoth made a series of trips to Washington to meet with two agents in the dark basement of a CIA building code-named Disneyland East. Surrounded by heating pipes, Zoppoth taught the agents how to install the camera, so that they could later train the Xerox repairman. The repairman would place a camera inside the Xerox machine while he serviced it; the camera didn't appear out of place among his jumble of tools and spare parts. On his next visit, he would replace the camera with another one containing fresh film, then turn the exposed film over to the CIA.</p></div> <!-- end .et_lb_text_block -->

<div><p>The system went into service in 1963. It wasn't long before the CIA asked the Xerox team if a similar system could be built for a much smaller desktop copier, the model 813.</p><p>Hiding an off-the-shelf camera inside such a small machine was impossible, so the engineers designed a miniaturized camera that operated off the photocopier's own power supply and held only a partial roll of film. They also modified the 813's mirrors and cut away pieces of the machine. Parts needed for the camera were farmed out to several model shops, so that nobody outside the research team could recognize what was being built. In 1964, Zoppoth was awarded a secret patent for the tiny surveillance camera that was hidden inside the modified machine.</p><p>Judging by the number of parts ordered from Xerox, Zoppoth believes that spy cameras may have been installed in photocopiers all over the world, to keep an eye on U.S. allies as well as enemies. But in 1969, a chemical company that had come up with a similar idea for spying on a competitor was caught red-handed. After that, it seemed likely that the Soviets would scrutinize their own machines more closely. But whether the Soviets ever found a concealed camera, or whether the CIA ceased planting them in photocopy machines, is uncertain.</p><p>Although the cameras built by Zoppoth and his co-conspirators seem primitive compared with today's sophisticated microelectronics, the project remains classified. Zoppoth retired in 1979. Another team member confirms his story but is unwilling to speak about any of the details. Other members could not be located, or would not discuss the matter. The CIA and Xerox will neither confirm nor deny Zoppoth's account, possibly because the company has secret research contracts with the government to this day.</p><h6>Stover, Dan<br>COPYRIGHT 1987 Bonnier Corporation</h6></div> <!-- end .et_lb_text_block -->

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In one of my previous blog posts on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Cross-Entropy-KL-Divergence-MLE/">cross entropy, KL divergence, and maximum likelihood estimation</a>, I have shown the “equivalence” of these three things in optimization. Cross entropy loss has been widely used in most of the state-of-the-art machine learning classification models, mainly because optimizing it is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation. However, there could be other losses used for classification problems.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discussed the log loss used for logistic regression, the cross entropy loss used for multi-class classification, and the sum of log loss  used for multi-class classification.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The prerequisites of this blog post have been discussed heavily in my other blog posts. For completeness, I made a copy of them here.</p>

<h4 id="leibniz-integral-rule">Leibniz Integral Rule</h4>

<p>Leibniz integral rule allows swapping positions of derivatives under certain circumstances.</p>



<p>To check the quick proof of Leibniz integral rule, please check one my blog posts on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/RL-Policy-Gradient-Unbiase-Estimate/">this</a>.</p>

<h4 id="derivatives-of-expected-value">Derivatives of Expected Value</h4>

<p>Based on Leibniz integral rule, we could also move the positions of derivatives inside the expected value or outside the expected value. For instance,</p>



<p>If $\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim P(x,y)}\big[ \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x,y) \big]$ is the loss function, to compute the derivative of the entire loss with respect to the parameter $\theta$, it is equivalent to computing the derivatives of the losses contributed by each data point $\mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x, y)$ with respect to the parameter $\theta$ and followed by computing its expected value, $\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim P(x, y)}\big[ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x, y) \big]$. Assuming all the data $(x, y)$ are uniformly distributed, it is simply just computing the derivative of the losses contributed by each data point $\mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x, y)$ with respect to the parameter $\theta$ and followed by taking their average. This is also how modern deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, works.</p>

<h3 id="log-loss-for-logistic-regression">Log Loss for Logistic Regression</h3>

<p>Log loss has been used for logistic regression for a long time. Given $(x, y)$, where $x$ is the input, $y$ is the label for $x$, our goal is to develop a model $f_{\theta}$, where $\theta$ are the model parameters. such that $\tilde{y} = f_{\theta}(x)$ is as close to $y$ as possible. For logistic regression, usually $y = 0$ or $1$. $y = 1$ means $x$ belongs to certain class, whereas $y = 0$ means $x$ does not belong to certain class.</p>



<p>Usually, logistic regression will compute the logit $z$ for the input $x$, where $z = g_{\theta}(x)$ followed by computing the sigmoid activation for $z$ to get the estimate of $y$, $\tilde{y}$, in the range of $(0,1)$. Concretely,</p>



<p>The loss function used for fitting is called log loss, which we would see later that it is actually binary cross entropy loss.</p>



<p>We further compute the derivative of this log loss with respect to the logit $z$.</p>





<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>The interpretation is very simple. If $\tilde{y} &gt; y$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x,y) &gt; 0$, the gradient descent wants to make $z$ smaller. Once $z$ is smaller, $\tilde{y}$ will be smaller and its deviation from $y$ will become smaller. Similarly, If $\tilde{y} &lt; y$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x,y) &lt; 0$, the gradient descent wants to make $z$ larger. Once $z$ is larger, $\tilde{y}$ will be larger and its deviation from $y$ will become smaller.</p>



<p>To update the model parameters $\theta$, we would need to compute the derivatives with respect to $\theta$.</p>



<h3 id="cross-entropy-loss-for-multi-class-classification">Cross Entropy Loss for Multi-Class Classification</h3>

<p>Cross entropy loss has been widely used for classification problems in deep learning. Given $(x, \mathbf{y})$, where $x$ is the input, $\mathbf{y}$ is the label for $x$. If $\mathbf{y}$ is an one-hot vector of size $n$, and $\mathbf{y}_i = 1$, our goal is to develop a model $f_{\theta}$, where $\theta$ are the model parameters, such that $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i = f_{\theta}(x)$ is as close to $\mathbf{y}_i$ as possible. Note that the motivation of using cross entropy loss behind is maximum likelihood estimation which might not be obvious to see. But I have discussed in my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Cross-Entropy-KL-Divergence-MLE/">post</a>.</p>



<p>Usually, multi-class classification will compute the logits $\mathbf{z}$ for the input $x$, where $\mathbf{z} = g_{\theta}(x)$ followed by computing the softmax activation for $\mathbf{z}$ to get the estimate of $\mathbf{y}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$, where $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i = 1$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i \in [0, 1]$ for $i \in [1, n]$. Concretely,</p>



<p>The loss function used for fitting is called softmax loss.</p>



<p>We further compute the derivative of this cross entropy loss with respect to the logits $\mathbf{z}$.</p>







<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>The interpretation is also very simple. If $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k &gt; \mathbf{y}_k$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{z}_k} \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x,\mathbf{y}) &gt; 0$, the gradient descent wants to make $\mathbf{z}_k$ smaller. Once $\mathbf{z}_k$ is smaller, $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k$ will be smaller and its deviation from $\mathbf{y}_k$ will become smaller. Similarly, If $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k &lt; \mathbf{y}_k$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{z}_k} \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x,\mathbf{y}) &lt; 0$, the gradient descent wants to make $\mathbf{z}_k$ larger. Once $\mathbf{z}_k$ is larger, $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k$ will be larger and its deviation from $\mathbf{y}_k$ will become smaller.</p>



<p>To update the model parameters $\theta$, we would need to compute the derivatives with respect to $\theta$.</p>



<h3 id="cross-entropy-loss-for-multi-class-classification-vs-log-loss-for-logistic-regression">Cross Entropy Loss for Multi-Class Classification VS Log Loss for Logistic Regression</h3>

<p>If we have $n = 2$ for cross entropy loss and compare it with log loss, we would immediately see that the form of log loss is exactly the same to binary cross entropy loss, and log loss for logistic regression is a special case for cross entropy loss for multi-class classification where $n = 2$ and the logit $z$ for the negative class ($y = 0$) is a fixed value $0$.</p>



<p>So if we have a binary classification problem, what is the difference between modeling it using log loss for logistic regression and cross entropy loss for binary classification, assuming the learning rate and other hyperparameters are the same? We could see that the gradients with respect to the positive logit $z$ for both models are always the same. However, when it comes to updating the model parameters $\theta$, the gradients for the two models would be different, because one model has only one logit whereas the other model has two logits. Therefore, although the two models are analogous, it is incorrect to say these two models are exactly the same.</p>



<p>One may ask which model is better for a binary classification problem. It is hard to say. But one thing that is for sure is that the binary cross entropy model is relatively easy to overfit. The reasons are the followings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The binary cross entropy model has more parameters compared to the logistic regression.</li>
  <li>The binary cross entropy model would try to adjust the positive and negative logits simultaneously whereas the logistic regression would only adjust one logit and the other hidden logit is always $0$, resulting the difference between two logits larger in the binary cross entropy model much larger than that in the logistic regression model.</li>
</ul>

<p>To prevent overfitting, we could use <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Label-Smoothing/">label smoothing</a> for cross entropy loss. I have discussed it previously and I am not going to elaborate it here.</p>

<h3 id="sum-of-log-loss-for-multi-class-classification">Sum of Log Loss for Multi-Class Classification</h3>

<p>While it might be rare, we could treat a multi-class classification problem as multiple one-vs-all classifications, each of which is a logistic regression. Given $(x, \mathbf{y})$, where $x$ is the input, $\mathbf{y}$ is the label for $x$. Our goal is to develop a model $f_{\theta}$, where $\theta$ are the model parameters, such that $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_j = f_{\theta}(x)$ is as close to $\mathbf{y}_j$ as possible, for all $j \in [1, n]$. Note that this is different from cross entropy loss for multi-class classification.</p>



<p>Usually, multi-class classification will compute the logits $\mathbf{z}$ for the input $x$, where $\mathbf{z} = g_{\theta}(x)$ followed by computing the sigmoid activation for each logit of $\mathbf{z}$ to get the estimate of $\mathbf{y}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$, where notably $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{y}_i$ do not have to equal to 1, and $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i \in [0, 1]$ for $i \in [1, n]$. Concretely,</p>



<p>The loss function used for fitting is called the sum of log loss. The classification of each class could be seen as mutually exclusive. TensorFlow has an implementation for this loss, which they call it <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits">tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits</a>, as well.</p>



<p>We further compute the derivative of this sum of log loss with respect to the logits $\mathbf{z}$. Because it is almost exactly the same to the derivative of log loss with respect to the logits $z$, we skipped some details.</p>





<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>The interpretation is the same as cross entropy loss for multi-class classification. If $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k &gt; \mathbf{y}_k$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{z}_k} \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x,\mathbf{y}) &gt; 0$, the gradient descent wants to make $\mathbf{z}_k$ smaller. Once $\mathbf{z}_k$ is smaller, $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k$ will be smaller and its deviation from $\mathbf{y}_k$ will become smaller. Similarly, If $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k &lt; \mathbf{y}_k$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{z}_k} \mathscr{L}_{\theta}(x,\mathbf{y}) &lt; 0$, the gradient descent wants to make $\mathbf{z}_k$ larger. Once $\mathbf{z}_k$ is larger, $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_k$ will be larger and its deviation from $\mathbf{y}_k$ will become smaller.</p>



<p>To update the model parameters $\theta$, we would need to compute the derivatives with respect to $\theta$.</p>

      <p>
        An effective vaccine against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is everyone's hope for a real return to normal life. More than 100 teams of scientists around the world are working to develop and test a vaccine against the virus SARS-CoV-2 as quickly as possible. They're employing  a huge variety of strategies and technologies, including some that have never been used in an approved vaccine before.</p>

        <p>"It's a very fascinating and kind of impressive effort," said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at the at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.</p>
        <p>"It's absolutely crucial."</p>
        <p>Even in countries that have had a devastating number of deaths from COVID-19, there is nowhere close to a level of "herd immunity" within the population preventing the disease from spreading exponentially if we go back to normal levels of social interaction, she said.</p>

        </section>

        <section>

        <h2>How far are we from the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine?</h2>
    
      <p>Typically, it takes an average of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603987/">more than 10 years</a> for a vaccine to get from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-clinical-trials-1.5580436">pre-clinical development (including animal testing) through three phases of clinical (human) trials</a> to market registration.</p>

      <p>The process has been fast-tracked  for COVID-19. The first human vaccine trials began in March, just two months after the virus and disease were identified. And <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-clinical-trials-1.5580436">different phases of human trials</a> are being run in an overlapping fashion instead of one at time — for example, Phase 2 might begin just a few weeks after the start of a six-month Phase 1 trial. </p>

      <p>Canada has a notably large number of vaccine candidates registered with the World Health Organization — at least eight.</p>
     
      <div id="tableAll">
          <h2>Candidate vaccines in clinical trials</h2>
           
          
          
      </div>

    </section>

    
    <section>

      <h2>Multiple vaccines on the horizon?</h2>
    
      <p>Most vaccine candidates that make it to preclinical testing never make it to market (about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603987/">94 per cent fail, a 2013 study</a> found). But in this case, with so many different vaccines under development, there may still end up being multiple vaccines for the coronavirus, possibly using different strategies, Saxinger predicts.</p>

      <p>There are a number of potential advantages if that happens:
        </p><ul>
          <li>They'd be using different ingredients and manufacturing facilities and wouldn't be competing for resources — allowing for more vaccine production.</li>
          <li>Different vaccines have different pros and cons. Some vaccines require more doses to be effective than others, while ease of manufacturing, testing and distribution varies.</li>
          <li>Some vaccines may be more suitable for some populations than others, due to factors such as age or genetics.</li>
        </ul>      
      

      <p>Stephen Barr is associate professor of microbiology and immunology who is part of a COVID-19 vaccine development team at at Western University in London, Ont. He noted that the "best" vaccine in the end may not be best for everybody. "But the second one might be, for those that don't respond, right? So it's always good to have these backup vaccines as well or vaccines that can be used in parallel around the world."</p>

      <h3>Whole virus vaccines</h3>
    
      <p>These are the most traditional types of vaccine. They've been used for a long time, and most of us have had these kinds of vaccines.</p>

      <h4>Inactivated virus</h4>
    
      <p>In this case, the virus is grown in large quantities in cells, and then killed, often with a chemical, which is usually formaldehyde, but heat or radiation can also be used. Two kinds of flu vaccines are made this way, grown in either chicken eggs or mammalian cells.</p>

          <li>It doesn't lead to as strong an immune response as a live virus. Several doses, including boosters at regular intervals, are usually necessary.</li>
          <li>It requires the virus to be grown in large quantities and that can take time and may not be as easy to scale up as other kinds of vaccines.</li>

      <h4>Live, attenuated virus</h4>
    
      <p>In this case, viruses are also grown in cells, but instead of being killed they're  genetically "weakened" so they can't infect cells and reproduce as effectively. Traditionally, this was done by getting the virus to grow in and adapt to an environment different than the one they normally infect. That's the approach used for vaccines such as varicella (chicken pox) or yellow fever. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates of this type use a high-tech genetic engineering approach called "codon deoptimization," where the virus is rebuilt from scratch, incorporating targeted mutations that weaken it. None of these vaccine prototypes for COVID-19 have made it to human trials.</p>

      <section>
        
        <h5>Pros</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Similar to real infection and usually provides long-lasting protection — sometimes lifelong — after one dose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>May not be suitable for people with weakened immune systems, long-term health problems, or people who've had organ transplants.</li>
          <li>Live viruses need to be refrigerated, making them more difficult to transport and unusable in countries without access to refrigeration.</li>
          <li>The virus must be grown in large quantities. That can take time and it may not be easy to scale up.</li>

      <h2>Vaccines that target part of a virus</h2>
    
        <p>These types of vaccines don't contain entire viruses. They present parts of viruses, such as proteins or sugars, to your immune system to help it learn to recognize the virus and build an immune response.</p>

        <p>In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the part of the virus that's typically targeted is the spike or "S" protein — the projections on its outer coat that make it look like a crown under a microscope ("corona" means "crown.") That's the protein the virus uses to bind to human cells, allowing it to enter. </p>

        <p>What varies  among different vaccine candidates is the way they make the spike protein and get it into the body — it may be injected directly, transported by a "carrier" virus that doesn't cause disease, or it may be manufactured by the human body itself using instructions encoded in DNA or RNA.</p>

      <h4>Protein subunit</h4>
    
      <p>With this type of vaccine, the protein is made outside the body. Traditionally, this was done by breaking whole viruses into pieces using detergent or a solvent such as ether. However, this can now be done with "recombinant" genetic technology, where the gene for a protein is inserted into another organism to grow the protein in large quantities.

        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Doesn't generate as strong an immune response as whole virus vaccines. A compound called an adjuvant needs to be included to boost a patient's immune response.</li>

      <h4>Virus-like particles</h4>
    
      <p>These are a special class of subunit vaccines, where the proteins are self-assembled into artificial particles that are intended to look like viruses to the human immune system. They bind to and enter cells like a virus, which is different from the way individual protein subunits do.</p>

      <p>Some vaccines on the market that use VLPs include vaccines for HPV (human papilloma virus) and Hepatitis B.</p>

      <section>
        
        <h5>Pros</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Produce a stronger immune response than regular subunit vaccines.</li>
          <li>Production is much faster than for traditional vaccines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensuring stability and purification can add to production time.</li>
          <li>Can be hard to produce in large quantities.</li>

      <h4>Non-replicating viral vector</h4>
    
      <p>Viral vectors are "carrier" viruses that don't cause the disease you're vaccinating against, such as COVID-19, but can be engineered to carry a piece of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Non-replicating viral vectors are viruses that have been genetically engineered so they can't replicate and cause disease. Then they're further modified to produce the protein for the disease you want, such as the coronavirus spike protein, and injected into the body to provoke an immune response.</p>

      <p>The viruses used by COVID-19 vaccine candidates include adenoviruses, MVA (modified vaccinia ankara, a weakened pox virus), parainfluenza and rabies.</p>

      <section>
        
        <h5>Pros</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Generates more powerful immune response than subunit proteins.</li>
          <li>Some don't have to be stored at very low temperatures (according to China-based company CanSino), so they're viable for use in resource-limited tropical areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul>          

          <li>People who have already been exposed to the viral vector, such as adenovirus, may be resistant.</li>
          <li>Harder to scale up than protein or DNA because a virus still needs to be grown.</li>
          <li>Because each virus can only infect one cell, large quantities of the virus need to be grown and injected, adding to production time.</li>   
        </ul>

<p>By HANS DUVEFELT, MD (7)</p>



<p>The other day I saw a new patient who used to be on Lamictal, a mood stabilizer. The young man explained that he had gone through a difficult time in his life a few years ago and his primary care doctor put him on Prozac, which, as he put it “hijacked” his brain and made him “ugly, hyper and careless”. The man immediately stopped the Prozac and his doctor prescribed Lamictal, which he stayed with for about a year.</p>



<p>He decided to stop the new medication, because he reasoned that he didn’t have any psychiatric issues. It was just a side effect of the Prozac, which he in retrospect probable hadn’t needed at all.</p>



<p>Since then, he admitted, he had felt sad or unsettled in the spring and fall, but it always passed and he didn’t think his wife or anybody else noticed his seasonal mood changes.</p>



<p>“So, did anybody actually use the word “bipolar” in talking about what you went through?” I asked.</p>



<p>He winced and almost seemed teary eyed. “Yeah, but I don’t think that’s right. How can you put a label on somebody that will follow them for the rest of their life because of what their brain did when, basically and literally, they were on drugs?”</p>



<p>I nodded.</p>



<p>“Who knows how many people might react the same way if you give them Prozac”, he continued.</p>



<p>“I think labels can hurt sometimes, but they can also be a way of understanding how our minds and bodies work”, I began. “I don’t believe diagnoses are as cut in stone as some people like to think.”</p>



<p>He looked quizzical as I continued:</p>



<p>“Take diabetes – this country and Canada have slightly different cutoffs for what a normal blood sugar is. Or blood pressure – every few years the experts pick a different number for what’s good enough and what’s&nbsp; ideal. I believe most things we call diseases are points at the extremes of a spectrum that we all fall somewhere on.”</p>



<p>Now he was the one nodding.</p>



<p>“Take mood”, I continued. “At one end of the mood spectrum there is depression and at the other there is what we call mania. Sometimes that looks like exaggerated happiness and confidence, but sometimes it is more like irritability and agitation. We can all experience any one of those moods, but usually we are somewhere in the middle. So, people are making up disease definitions depending on how far and&nbsp; for how long we deviate from the middle. But if we never move an inch from neutral, that’s not necessarily being healthy – I think of that as definitely abnormal.”</p>



<p>“I see what you mean”, he nodded again.</p>



<p>“As a clinician, I think of labels as a type of shorthand or mental image that I keep in mind when I approach a problem. They help me choose treatments and they help me explain things. But I tend to be slow in sticking labels on patients or in their medical records. I read a book once called ‘Shadow Syndromes’ that makes the point that looking at the extremes of whatever spectrum we are on helps us understand ourselves and can be very empowering.”</p>



<p>“So, Doc, do you think I’m bipolar?” He leaned forward.</p>



<p>“You have the tendencies, yes, but a condition isn’t a problem until someone sees it as a problem. If neither you nor the people around you see your mood variability, not to use the stronger word ‘mood swings’ as a problem, then fine. But I, knowing what you’ve told me about how your brain works, would be a fool to prescribe Zoloft or Lexapro if you ever came to me feeling terribly depressed. I would then think of you as somewhere on the bipolar spectrum, needing a slightly different treatment approach if we wanted to lift your mood.”</p>



<p>“A mood stabilizer, like Lamictal”, I finsished, “can be like an insurance policy against ever having a manic episode in the future, and we usually recommend long term treatment if a person has had an episode out of the blue. But I’m not so sure it’s necessary if the episode was triggered by Prozac or any other antidepressant. I’m sure there are lots of opinions about that, but that’s what I think, especially since your episode was not severe from what you’ve told me.”</p>



<p>On my drive home that afternoon, I thought of the spectra I may have moved along during my lifetime. I remember my mother commenting on how I had turned into such a slob; “When you were little you were so neat, you used to line everybody’s shoes up in the entryway.”</p>



<p>That’s the OCD spectrum, and I guess I narrowly escaped that diagnosis…</p>

<p>Although the color may seem to change as it passes from the image to the white background, in fact the color is the same in both circles and the bar between them.</p>
<p>This is an example of a color constancy illusion, in which our brains over-correct to account for what may look like a blueish shadow and tell us what color the bananas “should” be.</p>

<p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/openai-gpt3/cover.jpg"></p>

<p>OpenAI, a non-profit artificial intelligence research company backed by Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Marc Benioff, Sam Altman and others, released its third generation of language prediction model (GPT-3) into the open-source wild. Language models allow computers to produce random-ish sentences of approximately the same length and grammatical structure as those in a given body of text.</p>

<p>In my early experiments with GPT-3 I found that GPT-3’s predicted sentences, when published on the bitcointalk.org forum, attracted lots of positive attention from posters there, including suggestions that the system must have been intelligent (and/or sarcastic) and that it had found subtle patterns in their posts. I imagine that similar results can be obtained by republishing GPT-3’s outputs to other message boards, blogs, and social media.</p>

<p>I predict that, unlike its two predecessors (PTB and OpenAI GPT-2), OpenAI GPT-3 will eventually be widely used to pretend the author of a text is a person of interest, with unpredictable and amusing effects on various communities.
I further predict that this will spark a creative gold rush among talented amateurs to train similar models and adapt them to a variety of purposes, including: mock news, “researched journalism”, advertising, politics, and propaganda.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-being-served">Are you being served?</h2>

<p>I chose bitcointalk.org as the target environment for my experiments for a variety of reasons: It is a popular forum with many types of posts and posters.</p>

<p>So there are lots of posts for GPT-3 to study and learn from. The forum also has many people I don’t like. I expect them to be disproportionately excited by the possibility of having a new poster that appears to be intelligent and relevant.
I’ve been following the forum for years. There are many posts I know the answers to, so I could provide a quick response and measure how well GPT-3 does with comments similar to those I make.</p>

<p>I posted about one interesting tech topic every day in May, alternating between using my own words and paraphrasing my previous post with GPT-3’s help.  I didn’t take special care to make these GPT-3-enhanced posts blend in well. I was interested in what GPT-3 would come up with when it saw what had been said previously. The table below shows some results:</p>

<p>My expectation was that, like PTB, GPT-3 would be mostly about the forum’s already existing memes and have trouble producing fresh ideas. This prediction seems to have been true. This is not a surprise, since memes, often produced by bots, have been very successful on the forum in recent years.  Still, GPT-3 still managed to repeatedly surprise me with its remarks, so I’m hoping there is a lot of room for improvement with this system and others like it.  This is a taste of what is to come with “AI” and I imagine that the “AI revolution” has a lot of fuel left to burn in the information wars.</p>

<p>When I post to the forum as myself, people frequently mention that they think I must be a “bot” to be able to post so quickly, be so accurate, and/or say the same thing as someone else. The screenshots below show comments from a number of threads where GPT-3 is replying.  All of these were posted to bitcointalk.org within the last few days.  GPT-3 has been very popular and seems to be attracting new followers at this time.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-road-to-ai">On the road to AI</h2>
<p>I was recently watching a podcast about how OpenAI built their latest language model and it made me wonder what could be done with a system like this. I could not stop thinking about the applications of such a technology and how it could improve our lives.  I was thinking of how cool it would be to build a Twitter-like service where the only posts are GPT-3 outputs.</p>

<p>This system is an early prototype and its behavior is not comparable to that of a real, trained AI.  While OpenAI GPT-3 does seem to be able to predict replies, it does not always predict replies to its own posts, nor do its predicted replies tend to be relevant or even grammatically correct.  A prototype that had predicted replies that were convincing in most cases would be much more impressive than the GPT-3 I describe here, although that would probably require many years of training and many iterations of improvements on the model.  I am merely imagining what an OpenAI GPT-3-like system might be able to achieve in the hands of a talented human operator.</p>

<p>I have a confession: I <em>did not</em> write the above article. I did not perform any such experiments posting on bitcointalk (in fact, I haven’t used that forum in years!). But I did it on my own blog! <em>This article was fully written by GPT-3</em>. Were you able to recognize it? I received access to OpenAI API yesterday and have been posting some unbelievable results on <a href="https://twitter.com/maraoz">twitter</a>. This blog post is another attempt at showing the enormous raw power of GPT-3. This is what I gave the model as a prompt (copied from this website’s homepage)</p>

<p>and then just copied what the model generated verbatim with minor spacing and formatting edits (no other characters were changed). I generated different results a couple (less than 10) times until I felt the writing style somewhat matched my own, and published it. I also added the cover image. Hope you were as surprised as I was with the quality of the result.</p>

<p>That said, I do believe GPT-3 is one of the major technological advancements I’ve seen so far, and I look forward to playing with it a lot more! Very strange times lie ahead…</p>

It's wonderful, but as a centralized service it doesn't offer the same degree of customizability and flexibility. You can however <a href="https://substack.com/signup">get started</a> there a bit more easily, and it has leaderboards and a community.</p><p>Why not Wordpress? It's also wonderful, but it's not as modern as Ghost is. You can however quickly set up on wordpress.com and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org/">migrate</a> to a self-hosted version using wordpress.org, just like Ghost.</p><p>If you follow the instructions in this post, your blog will look something <a href="https://lyra.ghost.io/">like this</a> when done.

You can use <a href="https://canva.com/">Canva</a> or <a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a> to generate these, as well as <a href="https://iconfinder.com/">Iconfinder</a> for visual inspiration. You can also install a <a href="https://ghost.org/downloads/">desktop client</a> for editing Ghost posts.</p><h2 id="step-5-optionally-customize-your-theme">Step 5: Optionally, customize your theme</h2><p>If you're a developer and want to modify the look of your site, you can set up your Ghost theme for <a href="https://ghost.org/integrations/github">deployment</a> via GitHub. You would do that by forking <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Lyra">Lyra</a> and then setting up <a href="https://ghost.org/integrations/github/#install-the-ghost-theme-deploy-action">this action</a>. Now, every time you push a commit, the action triggers and the theme updates. You can also preview your edits by running Ghost <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/#install-ghost-cli">locally</a>.</p><p>Why might you want to edit your theme? By doing this you can edit the default copy on various pages, create new page templates, and the like. </p><p>Note that if you don't want to use the Lyra theme itself as a base, you can buy a pre-built one or learn how to customize <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/api/v3/handlebars-themes/">Ghost themes</a> yourself. If you do buy a theme, remember to get one of the themes that <a href="https://themeforest.net/search/ghost%20membership?utf8=%E2%9C%93">support</a> <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ghost+membership+themes">Ghost</a> <a href="https://github.com/curiositry/undefined-ghost-theme">memberships</a>, as not all of them do.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This whole thing should take you about an hour or so. By the end you'll have a decent looking blog at your own domain that can handle memberships, accept payments, and send out a paid newsletter. And it can be pseudonymous if you choose.</p>

                <img alt="Feature Image" src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-18-10-productivity-tools-for-react-developers-in-2020/featured_hu423684c0a14cc6abafb2fdc736b92799_314128_680x0_resize_q75_box.jpg">

            <p>Today we are going to discuss some great and promising tools to improve React developers` productivity and enhance the overall development workflow.</p>
<p>Usually when I need to start working on a new project (at least for personal projects, at work is a bit different) I use my own template which comes with the tools that I love, some of which made it to this list, but also with tools that I’m just ok with, like Material UI. After doing some research and building some sample apps and small projects with some other popular tools I decided to share some of my findings with the rest of you through this article.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s have a look at these hand-picked <strong>React productivity tools</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-eslint">1. ESLint</h2>







    
        
        
    


<figure data-src="/post/2020-07-18-10-productivity-tools-for-react-developers-in-2020/eslint_hua576a879e9267ad22f3e2c32c2d7f199_624135_700x0_resize_box_2.png">

</figure>

<p><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> can be a real game-changer for any JavaScript developer, including React lovers. Basically, it is packed with intelligent algorithms that can quickly analyze your code for possible bugs.</p>
<p>It even offers us the ability to automatically fix any issues without breaking the syntax.</p>
<p>To get started, I recommend using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb">ESLint configuration</a> created by the developers at Airbnb. Some of its major plus points include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Built-in support for React library (such as linting rules for hooks).</li>
<li>Focus on the best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool is a must-have for any project, and the Airbnb configuration is among my favorites, I do however add some personal touch to it, but 90% comes from their package.</p>

<h2 id="2-bit">2. Bit</h2>

</figure>

<p><a href="https://bit.dev/">Bit</a> has introduced a much-needed collaborative platform for React developers. It enables teams to work together on individual components.</p>
<p>It’s nothing but a command-line utility that enables us to write reusable code. Bit is completely open-source and that’s the main reason behind its massive popularity.</p>
<p>Most of its features are focused on building atomic components. So that they can easily be shared with others. You can even validate whether a component has any dependency or not by testing it separately from the project.</p>

<h2 id="3-create-react-app">3. Create React App</h2>

<p>As a React developer, you might have noticed how time-consuming it is to set up a new React project. So to minimize this issue, Facebook developers came up with an outstanding “<a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>” project.</p>
<p>It’s like a starter kit that helps you stay focused on coding your application instead of configuring the React instance. You just need to execute <code>npx create-react-app my-app</code> and that’s it. A fully configured app is now available for you to build upon your next project.</p>
<p>It can significantly boost your efficiency if you work as a freelance React developer for multiple clients.</p>

<p><a href="https://reactcosmos.org/">React Cosmos</a> is a development environment focused on building scalable, high-quality user interfaces by allowing us to prototype, test, and iterate quickly on each component of our application.</p>
<p>It makes it easy to prototype a single component. You can then iterate it without breaking any code. It even eases the process of debugging an issue by isolating components.</p>
<p>It is more suitable when you work with enterprise-level applications. The reason is that it helps us maintain high-quality code by dividing the project into small reusable components.</p>

<p>When I started the post I mentioned that I use Material UI for most of my projects, and it’s for a reason, I love <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>, and Material UI looked like the way to go, however, there are other alternatives, like <a href="http://react-toolbox.io/">React Toolbox</a>. Which is a collection of frequently used components that are all designed with Material Design.</p>
<p>It uses concepts like CSS Modules to have better flexibility.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this article, React Toolbox is packed with 28 components. Some of them include “App Bar”, “Date Picker”, “Switch”, and “Snackbar”.</p>

<p>Having a mobile-friendly website is like a standard these days. People expect that your website will work seamlessly on any device. Even search engines prefer a responsive website in their result pages.</p>
<p>Many developers rely on Bootstrap to design responsive, scalable, and professional-looking websites. But, the problem is that Bootstrap comes with its own components that are not integrated with React.</p>
<p>So, to fill this gap we have an open-source package called “<a href="https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap">React Bootstrap</a>". It has all Bootstrap components that are specifically rebuilt for React developers.</p>

<p>Want to speed up React application development?</p>
<p>Just have a look at <a href="https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot">React Slingshot</a>. It is a boilerplate that consists of React, Redux, and Babel.</p>
<p>The most important feature of Slingshot that makes it stand out from the rest of the tools is Rapid feedback. Basically, it automates the process of linting, unit tests, and hot reload whenever you update your app.</p>
<p>This way you can spend more time coding actual business logic instead of doing non-productive tasks.</p>

<p>A developer is as good as its editor, or maybe not, but the editor does help a lot with our daily development activities. I’m a big fan of Jetbrains, and WebStorm is my IDE of choice, however from time to time I try a few things as I did with VS Code, and now I wanted to look what other options are out there.</p>
<p>Something interesting which I found is <a href="http://reactide.io/">Reactide</a>, which is an IDE built for React. It really surprised me to find an IDE built for it, sure I found many plugging for other IDEs or text editors, but a full-blown IDE got my attention, so I gave it a try.</p>
<p>It has some interesting features, for example, you can visualize your project’s components right inside this IDE. It also has a built-in Node.js server that is integrated with a browser simulator. However interesting, I won’t probably switch, but I think it’s a good alternative to keep in mind, especially if you only do React or if you want to learn React and you want to remove away some of the hurdles of tuning your code editor to even get started.</p>

<p>Testing, testing, testing. Testing first, it’s what I always say! And having the right tools for testing is important. <a href="https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library">React Testing Library</a> is a small library that allows you to test your React code in a way that encourages best practices. It is simple to use and extends on top of standard libraries like <code>react-dom</code> and <code>react-dom/test-utils</code>.</p>
<p>The documentation is good, and they provided some good examples to get you started.</p>

<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> provides an interactive development environment where you can create new components, test them, or pick existing ones from the available component library.
<p>It is flexible enough to work with any major JavaScript frontend framework. For example, you can use it with React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Marko, and even raw HTML.</p>
<p>The best thing about Storybook is that it comes with a variety of addons. Some of its addons that I find interesting are as follows:-</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/google-analytics">google-analytics</a> (add support for support Google Analytics in components)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/jest">jest</a> (unit testing)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/storyshots">storyshots</a> (test components using snapshots)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/viewport">viewport</a> (change layouts for responsive components)</li>
</ul>
<p>Storybook has a great design and is really promising, I’d love to build more apps using this library in the future.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>React is one of the most popular front-end frameworks today, and because of its popularity, there’s a huge number of projects which go around React and building apps with React.</p>
<p>When choosing which tools you are going to use for your new project is very easy to just use what you know, but sometimes it’s good to explore which other options exist, if you are like me, you’ll be surprised by the number of options, high quality and great options out there.</p>
<p>I hope you like this list, if you have any suggestions or favorites, please let me know, I’d be more than happy to try it out.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

                    <div><p><em>NOTE: I've used Mac hardware for over 25 years and own both laptops described in this article.</em></p><p>Something very interesting has happened early on in the Summer of 2020 while quietly very disturbing for Apple. A slew of ultra-low power high-performance ultra-books have entered the market based on AMDs 4th generation Ryzen 4000 series APUs code-named "Renoir" for their Zen 2 core 7nm process micro-architecture. <br>There have been leaps in low power mobile laptop processors for decades already but this time it seems very very different. <br>Why is that ? The short answer is extreme value for money and Apple's decline with regards to design and innovation since the old man passed away almost a decade ago. Apple's move to it's own ARM-based macs is a topic for another article that will counter-intuitively substantiate this seemingly reckless claim.</p><p>So let's go into some detail and start by looking at a 13-inch MacBook Pro circa mid-2020. With the CPU maxed out but leaving the memory and storage at their defaults to allow for a fair comparison with the serial killers here's what we have ...</p></div><figure><img src="https://imagine27.com/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Victim #1 - mid-2020 13-inch MacBook Pro</figcaption></figure><div><p>It's well known that Macbook Pros are a luxury item that exists in a lightweight(3.1 lbs) aluminum uni-body design. So it's not surprising that the price tag for this configuration is $1999.</p><p>Now for comparison let's look at one of these ultra-books with a price of $679.99. <br>The 14-inch Acer Swift 3 is roughly the same dimensions and just as thin (0.63 inches vs 0.61 inches) as the 13-inch Macbook Pro but it weighs in at just 2.65 lbs. That's 15% lighter. It also has an aluminum body which while not cast in one piece is hard to tell unless you look at it from the bottom and is functionally just as good and maybe even better than the Macbook Pro.<br>The screen brightness of 270 nits and an HD resolution of 1920x1080 aren't as great as the Macbook Pro which has a screen brightness of 500 nits and a resolution of 2560x1600 but the difference is hardly noticeable except in broad daylight and who wants a 16:10 over a 16:9 aspect ratio anyway for almost 3X the price ?</p></div><figure><img src="https://imagine27.com/content/images/2020/07/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Exhibit A - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086KKKT15">The 14-inch Acer Swift 3 with AMD's Ryzen 4700U APU</a></figcaption></figure><p>Where things get dark for the Macbook Pro is performance. <br>Using Geekbench 5 we see a tale that is something of a horror story for Apple. </p><figure><img src="https://imagine27.com/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Geekbench 5 CPU scores</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://imagine27.com/content/images/2020/07/image-3.png" alt=""><figcaption>Geekbench 5 OpenCL compute scores</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://imagine27.com/content/images/2020/07/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>Fedora 32 Linux runs perfectly on the 14-inch Acer Swift 3&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>There's not much more to say other than as of Summer 2020 there now exists a light-weight aluminum body ultra-book that runs Windows or Linux perfectly for 33% the price of a 13-inch Macbook Pro with 115% the performance of the maxed out i7 CPU option.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://blog.thea.codes/reading-analog-values-with-the-samd-adc">previous blog post</a>, I walked through how to do a basic analog read using the SAM D21's Analog to Digital converter (ADC). While this simple setup can work for a lot of cases, it's not uncommon to want to get better performance or accuracy out of the ADC.</p>
<p>This post explores the various configuration options for the ADC and how it impacts speed and accuracy. Since the SAM D family has similar ADC peripherials across the line this information is likely applicable to all of them. Additionally, the techniques and ideas here are generally applicable to all ADCs.</p>
<p>One more thing before I get started - this is just what I've gathered from the datasheets, application notes, code examples, and observation on real hardware. I could be totally wrong about some of these things! I'll try to make a note when there's something I'm not sure of - and if you know the answer don't hestitate to <a href="https://thea.codes/">reach out to me</a>.</p>
<h2>A handy dandy calculator</h2>
<p>There's several configuration options for the SAM D21 ADC. Some of them impact speed, some impact accuracy, and some impact both. I created this calculator to show how the various registers impact the ADC. This is a <em>super</em> handy tool for tuning the ADC for your particular use case and takes a lot of the guess work out of it. It's what I wish I had when I first started with the SAM D21.</p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>: This calculator is only valid for <em>single ended, one-shot measurements</em>. On the whole, differential measurements and free-running mode take slightly less time. You can read more details about their timing in <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/SAM_D21_DA1_Family_DataSheet_DS40001882F.pdf">Section 33.6.5.1 of the datasheet</a>.</p>


<p>The most important numbers to note here are the <strong>conversion time</strong> and the <strong>max input impedance</strong>. The conversion time is the overall time it takes to perform the conversion - this takes into account the clock, sample time, and propagation delay (it's not a simple sum, unfortunately). The impedance is our first topic for tuning.</p>
<h2>Input impedance</h2>
<p>The ADC on the SAM D21 makes measurements by charging a capacitor to the input voltage. In order for measurements to be accurate the capacitor must have enough time to charge up to the input voltage before sampling occurs. How long this takes depends on the input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance">impedance</a>. If you assume that you're measuring DC voltage then impedance is the same as resistance. So you just have to think about all of the resistance between the voltage you're trying to measure and the ADC input pin.</p>
<p>For example, for this circuit:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_impedance.svg" alt="Circuit with impedance"></p>
<p>The input impedance is 250kΩ (100kΩ + 150kΩ). When connecting this circuit to the ADC you have to ensure that the ADC is configured so that it has enough time to fully charge that capacitor with that amount of input impedance. The way this is done is by changing the sample time, <code>ADC-&gt;SAMPCTRL.SAMPLEN</code>. Increasing the sample time gives the capacitor a longer amount of time to charge and thus increasing the amount of input impedance the ADC can deal with. It also slightly increases the overall conversion time. Try using the calculator above to get the ADC to work with the 250kΩ impedance shown in the example above (spoilers: you only have to increase the sample time by 1).</p>
<p>Here's the code for changing the sample time. You should do this before enabling the ADC:</p>
<pre><span>// Set the sample time length to accommodate for input impedance.</span>
<span>ADC</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>SAMPCTRL</span><span>.</span><span>reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>ADC_SAMPCTRL_SAMPLEN</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
</pre>
<p>You'll run into input impedance a lot. For example, if you have a potentiometer configured as a <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers/all#applications">voltage divider</a> to provide a simple knob input for your project then the ADC's max input impedance must be greater than the whole potentiometer's resistance.</p>
<p>This illustrates why: when the potentiometer is close to the end the current must travel through nearly the entire resistance of the potentiometer before reaching the ADC input:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_pot.svg" alt="Circuit with potentiometer"></p>
<p>If you have a use case where you <em>don't</em> want to increase the sample time for the ADC, you can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_amplifier">buffer</a> to change the source impedance, like in this circuit that provides a source impedance of just 1kΩ:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_buffer.svg" alt="Circuit with active buffer"></p>
<p>For more details on how the calcuator figures out the max input impedance and how the capacitor charging works see <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/SAM_D21_DA1_Family_DataSheet_DS40001882F.pdf">section 37.11.4.3 of the datasheet</a>.</p>
<h2>Baseline</h2>
<p>Alright, now that you've got the ADC configured with the proper input impedance you can get a sense for the baseline accuracy of the measurements. ADCs have a couple of real-world properties that impact accuracy. These are generally presented by the manufacturer as a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_nonlinearity">Integral Nonlinearity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_nonlinearity">Differential Nonlinearity</a>. Those scary words basically just boil down to "how does the ADC's <em>actual</em> measurements compare to what I <em>expect</em> the measurements to be?" For example, if you give the ADC <code>1.0v</code> and it measures <code>1.1v</code> that's some of that non-linearity showing through.</p>
<p>Before tweaking the ADC settings to get better accuracy it's important to understand what the <em>current</em> accuracy looks like. For my tests, I used a precision voltage source (a calibrated 16-bit digital to analog converter) and measured 100 data points across the input voltage range of the ADC. I then compared the measured values against the expected values to determine the amount of error.</p>
<p>Here's two images that show the real-world performance of the SAM D21 ADC with minimal configuration - the same configuration used in my previous blog post and similar to the configuration you'll see by default in Arduino: 12 bit, one sample, no offset or gain correction.</p>
<p>Here's the measured results compared against the expected values:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_chart_1.svg" alt="baseline comparison"></p>
<p>And here's that same data but represented as the amount that each measurement was off from the expected measurement:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_chart_2.svg" alt="baseline error"></p>
<p>While this isn't entirely awful there is still lots of room for improvement! The next few sections will discuss techniques for improving the ADC's accuracy.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want some more information on all the different real world properties of ADCs and DACs and how those affect accuracy, check out this <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa013/slaa013.pdf">application note from TI on data converters</a>.</p>
<h2>Multisampling and averaging</h2>
<p>You can improve the SAM D21 ADC accuracy by taking multiple samples for a measurement and then averaging them. Luckily, the hardware can do this for you. However, since multisampling and averaging cause each measurement to take a longer amount of time you'll need to balance speed and accuracy for your use case. If you're measuring something that doesn't need to be sampled at very high rate using more multisampling and averaging is a good idea. The general rule of thumb is to use as much as you can while still sampling fast enough to meet your requirements.</p>
<p>I'm going to show you how multisampling and averaging can impact accuracy. The SAM D21 can be configured to average <code>1</code> to <code>1024</code> samples in steps of powers of two. For the first test I set the number of samples to average to <code>64</code>. Here's the results:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_chart_3.svg" alt="64 sample error results"></p>
<p>This is already a huge improvement over the baseline. Note that I also reduced the scale of the graph. The time cost for doing 64 samples isn't too much of a hit on performance, either.</p>
<p>Here's the code for configuring multisampling and averaging. Again, do this before enabling the ADC.</p>
<pre><span>// Configure multisampling and averaging.</span>
<span>// Note that ADJRES must be set according to table</span>
<span>// 33-3 in the datasheet.</span>
<span>ADC</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>AVGCTRL</span><span>.</span><span>reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>ADC_AVGCTRL_SAMPLENUM_256</span> <span>|</span> <span>ADC_AVGCTRL_ADJRES</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>);</span>

<span>// For multisampling to work correctly the RESSEL part</span>
<span>// of CTRLB must be set to 16-bit, even if you're doing</span>
<span>// 12-bit measurements. See section 33.6.7  in the</span>
<span>// datasheet.</span>
<span>ADC</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>CTRLB</span><span>.</span><span>reg</span> <span>|=</span> <span>ADC_CTRLB_RESSEL_16BIT</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
<p>Okay, so <code>64</code> samples looks better, but what if you use even more samples? How much does that improve things?</p>
<p>Well here's at <code>256</code> samples:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_chart_4.svg" alt="256 sample error results"></p>
<p>And at <code>1024</code> samples:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_chart_5.svg" alt="1024 sample error results"></p>
<p>For higher sample rates the error curve tends to flatten out - indicating that the ADC is exhibiting a more linear transfer function - which is a good thing. However, notice that the curve as a whole has migrated upwards a bit. From what I can gather this is due to <em>offset error</em> accumulating, and offset error is the topic of the next section.</p>
<h2>Offset &amp; gain error correction</h2>
<p>Okay, so you've determined how much multisampling you want to use for your application, however, things aren't quite perfect. If you're like me and decided to go with <code>256</code> samples you now have an offset on all of your measurements. You could just update your firmware to subtract the offset from each measurement but the hardware can actually do this <em>and a little more</em> for you.</p>
<p>The SAM D21 has the ability to apply both <em>offset</em> and <em>gain error</em> correction. <em>Offset error</em> is pretty easy to intuit from what you've experienced so far and the graphs above - it's a constant amount of error on each measurement. The <em>gain error</em> is a bit more subtle. It's the difference between the measured value and the expected value at the top of the ADC's range - that is, it's deviation from the <em>slope</em> of the ideal transfer function. This picture illustrates this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/adc_total_error.png" alt="gain error"></p>
<p><em>Source: Microchip Application Note TB3185</em></p>
<p>When looking at the error graphs of real-world measurements in previous sections the gain error can be see as a "tilt" in the error line. Ideally, the line of best fit in that chart would be straight across.</p>
<p>Okay, enough theory. How do you address the gain and offset errors? The SAM D21 has two registers, <code>ADC-&gt;OFFSETCORR</code> and <code>ADC-&gt;GAINCORR</code>, for configuring the hardware to do the correction for you. The hardware will automatically apply the formula <code>result = (conversion_value - OFFSETCORR) * GAINCORR</code>. This is detailed in <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/SAM_D21_DA1_Family_DataSheet_DS40001882F.pdf">section 33.6.10 of the datasheet</a>. The datasheet doesn't give a lot of hints on figuring out these values, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The best way I've found for calculating these values is to take two measurements: one in the bottom quarter of the ADC's range (say, at 15%) and one at the top quarter of the ADC's range (say, at 85%). This is from the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/90003185A.pdf">TB3185 Application Note</a>. Once you have these two measurements you can determine the gain and offset error using these formulas:</p>
<pre><span>low_expected</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>low_measured</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>high_expected</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>high_measured</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

<span>gain_error</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>high_measured</span> <span>-</span> <span>low_measured</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>hi…</span></pre></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Many of you will know that I am a huge proponent of Ansible and Infrastructure as Code in general. Using automation and version control to manage the configuration of your systems not only saves you time in the long run but it also gives makes you more employable. The latest Red Hat certifications, for example, are <em>all-in</em> on Ansible.</p><blockquote>Every file I reference in this blog post will be available in <a href="https://github.com/ironicbadger/compose-secret-mgt">this Git repo</a>.</blockquote><p>This article is an outline of how I use Ansible and Ansible Vault in conjunction with docker-compose to keep my secrets safe and encrypted whilst still being able to push my repos to Github publicly.</p><p>Why bother using Ansible to manage a file that you can very easily edit yourself by hand? It seems like a lot of overhead. In some ways, you are right.</p><p>If all you're doing is deploying one or two services using a docker-compose file or a docker run command then at first, it is easier to hand crank these files. That is, until you try and remember the parameters used to configure the container 6 months from now or a disaster strikes.</p><p>A disaster could mean you accidentally deleted the VM, made a breaking change to a config file without realising it, or simply did something you shouldn't have. There are many ways you could lose the configuration used to create your containers and by committing these files to git (Github, Gitlab, a self-hosted Gitea instance, etc) you instantly create a versionable backup. You can go back through history and see what changed, when, where and if your commit messages are ok maybe even figure out why, retrospectively.</p><p>This comes with a cost though. You must make <em>every single change</em> using this method from here on out. If you make a manual change to your compose yaml file and then run Ansible again next week, those manual changes will be overwritten. You have to commit.</p><p>Another issue we need to overcome is that your configuration is now out in the open (if you push to a public Github), including secrets. Secrets can include (but are not limited to) domain names, file paths, API keys, passwords, email addresses and so on. Essentially, they're anything you'd rather someone else didn't know.</p><p>We need a way to encrypt those secrets but also access them when generating our docker-compose yaml file. Ansible Vault makes this simple. I'll be the first to admit this isn't a totally straightforward process at first but over time, it will become second nature. Promise!</p><p>We'll come onto integrating Ansible Vault with Ansible in a moment. It's also easy to confuse <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible Vault</a> with <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Hashicorp Vault</a>, they are two different secret handling projects that have nothing whatsoever to do with one another.</p><p>To create a new, empty encrypted file run:</p><pre><code>ansible-vault create foo.yaml
</code></pre><p>You'll be asked for a password before being launched into your <code>$EDITOR</code> (the default is vi). Save and close this file and you'll have an AES encrypted file on disk.</p><p>To edit this file execute:</p><pre><code>ansible-vault edit foo.yaml
</code></pre><p>Again, you'll be asked for your password and be launched into your <code>$EDITOR</code>. Make your changes, then save and quit.</p><h2 id="protecting-you-from-yourself">Protecting you from yourself</h2><p><br>However, here's a second way to edit vault files. This method is is my personal preference using:</p><pre><code>ansible-vault decrypt foo.yaml
</code></pre><p>This decrypts your file and leaves it decrypted until you encrypt it again with:</p><pre><code>ansible-vault encrypt foo.yaml
</code></pre><p>The upside of this approach is that <code>foo.yaml</code> is just another clear-text file making edits via vscode or another editor besides <code>$EDITOR</code> trivial. I find this preferable in long editing sessions.</p><p>The downside is it's all too easy to accidentally commit an unencrypted file to git. I had to delete a git repo once when I leaked my gmail password on Github, it was picked up by bots in under 20 minutes! Once a file is pushed to a public repository, the values in this file are there forever or until you delete the repository due to the way git's db tracks files for versioning (or until you do some clever editing to the git db, but ain't no-one got time for that).</p><p>Nick Busey from <a href="https://homelabos.com/">HomelabOS</a> wrote me a neat little pre-commit hook that will not allow an unencrypted vars file to be committed.</p><pre><code>if ( cat vars/vault.yaml | grep -q "\$ANSIBLE_VAULT;" ); then
echo "[38;5;108mVault Encrypted. Safe to commit.[0m"
else
echo "[38;5;208mVault not encrypted! Run 'make encrypt' and try again.[0m"
exit 1
fi
</code></pre><p>This pre-supposes your secrets live in <code>vars/vault.yaml</code>. In the git repo accompanying this post look for <code>git-init.sh</code>, this installs the hook to <code>.git/hooks/pre-commit</code>.</p><p>More on Ansible Vault shortly.</p><p><br>With a bit of effort you'll be able to pick up the key principles of Ansible in a day or two. <a href="https://twitter.com/geerlingguy">Jeff Geerling</a> just released a really excellent set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ">Ansible 101</a> videos on Youtube. If you're confused about anything relating to Ansible, his videos are a good place to start.</p><p>To make things easy, I assume you have two hosts. The first is the target host which will be running docker and where your completed, clear-text docker-compose yaml file will ultimately live -- let's call this <code>server</code>. The second is where you do your development work, probably a desktop or laptop -- let's call this <code>client</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ktz.me/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-18-at-4.01.51-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ktz.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-18-at-4.01.51-PM.png 600w, https://blog.ktz.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-18-at-4.01.51-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.ktz.me/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-18-at-4.01.51-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.ktz.me/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-18-at-4.01.51-PM.png 1784w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Ensure that Ansible is installed on the <code>client</code> and that Python is installed on the <code>server</code>. Installation varies per OS so please refer to the Ansible <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">documentation</a> for steps on your system.</p><p>Ansible works over SSH. In order for the best experience it is suggested that you have SSH keys copied to the <code>server</code> so that you can connect without a password. From your <code>client</code> run <code>ssh-copy-id user@server</code>.</p><blockquote>In my testing for this article <code>192.168.1.50</code> was an Ubuntu 20.04 VM. There is nothing unique here to Ubuntu, so these concepts will apply to almost any Linux host.</blockquote><p>Ensure that <code>ssh server</code> works without specifying a password. If you'd like extra points make use of <code>~/.ssh/config</code> with the following entry:</p><pre><code># ~/.ssh/config

Host server
  Hostname 192.168.1.50
  User alex</code></pre><p><br>We're going to create an inventory file so that Ansible knows which hosts we want to manage. Remember all files can be found in <a href="https://github.com/ironicbadger/compose-secret-mgt">this git repo</a>.</p><pre><code>[server]
192.168.1.50
</code></pre><p>This inventory file assigns the host <code>192.168.1.50</code> to the group <code>[server]</code>. Ansible can do a whole lot with 'host groups' but that's largely beyond the scope of this article, check out the Ansible docs if you're interested in learning more.</p><p>We can test that Ansible is working with an ad-hoc command like this.</p><pre><code>alex@mooncake compose-secret-mgt % ansible -m ping -i inventory server
192.168.1.50 | SUCCESS =&gt; {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
</code></pre><p>This show us that the server replied <code>pong</code> to our <code>ping</code> request made using the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ping_module.html">ping module</a>.</p><p><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html">Modules</a> are an important concept in Ansible and are written in Python. They are what actually do the work we define in our tasks, roles and playbooks.</p><p>Now that we've verified connectivity between our <code>client</code> and <code>server</code> we can move onto templating.</p><p>We're going to template an example <code>ini</code> file, this has nothing to with your eventual compose templating. However, it shows that we can use these principals to manage our entire server configuration, including the apps that run on it.</p><p>Ansible uses the <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja2</a> templating language to perform substitutions in template files. We will be using the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/template_module.html">template</a> module for this. Here is a <em>non-functional</em> snippet of the config file for <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>, a self-hosted Github alternative. The full file was much too long but you'll get the idea by the time we're done with this example.</p><pre><code>APP_NAME = {{ subdomain_git }}.{{ domain_full }}
RUN_MODE = prod
RUN_USER = git

[repository]
ROOT = {{ data_root_path }}/git/repositories

[server]
APP_DATA_PATH    = {{ data_root_path }}/gitea
SSH_DOMAIN       = {{ subdomain_git }}.{{ domain_full }}
HTTP_PORT        = {{ listen_port_gitea }}
ROOT_URL         = https://{{ subdomain_git }}.{{ domain_full }}/
DOMAIN           = {{ subdomain_git }}.{{ domain_full }}
</code></pre><p>You can see above, several variables surrounded by <code>{{ }}</code>. Jinja2 uses these double braces to know where to perform substitutions. The values of these substitutions come from Ansible variables. </p><p>Note that we can construct strings using concatenation with multiple variables like <code>{{ subdomain }}.{{ domain_full }}</code>. This allows us to easily change the subdomain used for git independently from the main domain and is especially useful when the same string is required multiple times in the same file.</p><p>We can also reuse <code>domain_full</code> elsewhere throughout our entire infrastructure and only define it in one place.</p><p>For example, suppose that in your compose file you want to reuse some of these values. Port numbers, paths, etc. To change the port the app is listening on manually would be half a dozen edits. Using Ansible, it's <em>just one</em>. It is automatically updated everywhere it appears all at once using templating.</p><blockquote>You can follow along in the git repo by running <code>ansible-playbook -i inventory example1.yaml</code>.</blockquote><pre><code># example1.yaml - barebones templating example
- hosts: server
  vars:
    - subdomain_git: git 
	  - domain_full: domain.com
	  - data_root_path: /data
	  - listen_port_gitea: 3000
  tasks:
    - name: template test
      template:
        src: example.ini.j2
        dest: example.ini
</code></pre><p>For example if we execute the playbook above and run the template through Jinja2, we create the following output.</p><pre><code>alex@blogtest:~$ cat example.ini
APP_NAME = git.domain.com
RUN_MODE = prod
RUN_USER = git

[repository]
ROOT = /data/git/repositories

[server]
APP_DATA_PATH    = /data/gitea
SSH_DOMAIN       = git.domain.com
HTTP_PORT        = 3000
ROOT_URL         = https://git.domain.com/
DOMAIN           = git.domain.com
</code></pre><p>We told Ansible to run the templating module against the group of hosts defined under <code>server</code>. It then performed variable substitutions using the variables values defined in the playbook (variables are tightly scoped in Ansible) and templated them into our target file. Finally the module copied this file to the target <code>server</code> file path we provided.</p><p>Take a look at the file <code>var…</code></p></div></section></div>

<p>A few months ago I started working on a research project trying to pretrain my own, more efficient language model from scratch. I got access to a 128-core TPUv3 pod from the Tensorflow Reseach Cloud and used it to pretrain a <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>124</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">124</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M parameter GPT-2 model to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI's results (my pretrained model used was trained for about <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>8</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/8</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>21</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">21</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> ppl on OpenWebText compared to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>17</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">17</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> ppl for OpenAI's model), and then pretrained an ALBERT-style GPT-2 (that I'm calling ALGPT2) language model with a factorized input embedding and parameter sharing that would reduce the number of paramters from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>124</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">124</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M to around <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>12</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">12</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ALGPT-2 doesn't preform as well as GPT-2 (ALGPT-2 gets <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>31</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">31</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> ppl on OpenWebText compared to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>21</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">21</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> ppl for my pretrained GPT-2 model), but I'm writing this series of blog posts to go through everything I've learned over the last few months.</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>The main thing that I wanted to do from this sort-of "research project" that I was working on by myself this spring was to develop and train a more efficient version of the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>124</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">124</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M parameter version of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> (I wanted to pretrain the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>B param version of GPT-2 but since I only got access to the TPU pod for a week, I had to choose a model that would train in time.).</p>
<p>I was able to almost replicate the 124M parameter version of GPT-2 by pretraining it to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI's results (my pretrained model used was trained for about <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>8</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/8</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>21</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">21</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> ppl on OpenWebText compared to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>17</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">17</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> ppl for OpenAI's model),</p>
<p>My idea of making a more efficient transformer didn't really work out since my pretrained transformer ended up being about <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">20</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>ppl worse than an equivalent GPT-2 model, but I wanted to writeup what I learned over the two or three months that I was working on this.</p>

<p>A little bit about myself: I'm an incoming software engineering student at the University of Waterloo and this post is supposed to be a writeup of a NLP research project that I was working on from around March to May of 2020 (right in the middle of the first Covid-19 lockdown of 2020, I'm currently writing this on July 15, 2020 while waiting for my Pix2PixHD model to train for a few hundred epochs on Google Colab).</p>
<p>Over the last three or four years I've done a lot of machine learning related stuff. I started out back in early 2017 by going through the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk010AvJn990-Vqb1MA50AAVbnMg8uw:1594828665718&amp;q=Introduction+to+Machine+Learning+with+Python:+A+Guide+for+Data+Scientists&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLVT9c3NEwyLzRLKs_Ke8RowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uVB18ixi9fTMKynKTylNLsnMz1MoyVfwTUzOyMxLVfBJTSzKy8xLVyjPLMlQCKgsycjPs1JwVHAvzUxJVUjLL1JwSSxJVAhOzkwFGl9cUgwAxHs76ZgAAAA&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969">Introduction to Machine Learning with Python</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hands+on+machine+learning+with+scikit-learn+and+tensorflow&amp;oq=hands+on+mac&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j46j0l5.1936j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a> books. At the time, I didn't really understand all the math behind neural networks, but it got me hooked on ML and then took the <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">deeplearning.ai</a> courses on Coursera and the original <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> course (back in late 2017 when they hadn't switched over to Pytorch and still used Tensorflow and Keras).</p>
<p>I started competing on <a href="https://kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> in early 2018 and pretty much kept on competing in competitions non-stop for about a year and a half afterwards, winning a few medals and becoming a competitions expert (At one point I was ranked in the top 1000 Kagglers worldwide). Kaggle was a really nice way to get a lot of experience using neural networks because of the wide range of competitions and datasets that I had access to. I started out by doing a few semantic segmentation competitions then moved onto competing in a few NLP competitions. Since around mid 2019, I've been working on a bunch of different projects in ML and lower-level CS stuff. I worked on making a PyTorch-style machine learning library in <a href="https://github.com/bkkaggle/L2/tree/c%2B%2B">c++</a> and more recently in <a href="https://github.com/bkkaggle/L2">Rust</a> and for the last few months I've also been trying to keep up with all the new machine learning (esp NLP) papers on arXiv.</p>
<p>I was pretty lucky that I started learning NLP right before transformers exploded in popularity, I remember when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">word2vec</a> and LSTMs were still SOTA on a lot of NLP tasks, and it's pretty nice to see how much the field of NLP has changed in just a few years, going from when LSTMs with only a a handfull of layers and 512 units was considered to be a large network and computationally expensive to train, to training LSTMs with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473">attention</a> layers on top, to the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer encoder/decoder networks</a>, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFIT</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMO</a>, then <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683">T5</a>, to just a few months ago with the explosion of new, more efficient replacements for self-attention like the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/">Sparse Transformer</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451">Reformer</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00743">Synthesizers</a>, and now <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, which IMO has the potential to really change the whole field of NLP.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago we trained shallow recurrent networks on datasets, then pretrained large transformer language models on large datasets and finetuned on task-specific datasets. Now the whole idea of just training a gigantic language model on a huge dataset, then conditioning the model in a form of few-shot learning by prepending a few examples of a certain task to an input feels like it can really make NLP models a lot more accessible and easier to productionize as well as making human-chatbot interactions a lot more realistic than they are today.</p>
<p>I've rambled on for long enough, lets get to the main topic of this post.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> is basically a transformer decoder. It's an embedding layer that maps a one-hot vector of a given token's index (all the GPT-2 models use a vocabulary size of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50257</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50257</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) to a <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>768</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">768</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dimensional vector (all GPT-2 numbers in this blog post will be for the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>124</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">124</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>m parameter version of GPT-2) plus the positional encoding followed by a stack of self-attention and feed-forward layers that each output a <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>768</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">768</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dimensional vector (keeping the number of outputs for each layer constant) followed by an output embedding (the weights of the input and output embeddings are tied to make training easier) that maps the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>768</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">768</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dimensional vector that is the output of the last layer of the transformer to the same <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50257</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50257</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dimensional vector that represents the probability of each token in the vocabulary being the next token in the sequence. Take a look at <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT-2</a> for a more in-depth look into GPT-2.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942">ALBERT</a> (A Lite BERT) is a paper that takes a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and identifies some ways in which to make it more efficient and reduce the number of parameters in the model in four major ways: a factorized embedding, layer-wise parameter sharing, a sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss, and removing dropout.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Factorized embedding</h3>
<hr>
<p>GPT-2's embedding has a lot of parameters. It's really just a matrix of dimensions <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50257</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>768</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50257 \times 768</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. That means that the input embedding alone uses up almost <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50257</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>768</mn><mo>=</mo><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mo>∼</mo><mn>38</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50257 \times 768 = \space \sim 38,000,000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> parameters which is a pretty big chunk of the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>128</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">128</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M total parameters in the model.</p>
<p>The ALBERT authors propose a factorized embedding with an intermediate embedding size of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>128</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">128</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, one embedding of size <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50257</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>128</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50257 \times 128</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and another embedding of size <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>128</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>768</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">128 \times 768</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. By breaking up the large embedding matrix into two smaller matrices, the total number of parameters used in the embedding goes from about <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>38</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">38</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M to about <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M.</p>
<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50257</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>128</mn><mo>=</mo><mo>∼</mo><mn>6</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50257 \times 128 = \sim 6,000,000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>128</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>768</mn><mo>=</mo><mo>∼</mo><mn>100</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">128 \times 768 = \sim 100,000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p>The authors try different intermediate embedding sizes and settle on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>128</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">128</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as a good tradeoff betweeen parameters and performance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Layer-wise parameter sharing</h3>
<hr>
<p>In a normal transformer model, the transformer layers are created something like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BERT</span><span>(</span>nn<span>.</span>Module<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> n_layers<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>__init__<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
        self<span>.</span>blocks <span>=</span> nn<span>.</span>ModuleList<span>(</span><span>[</span>Block<span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> _ <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>n_layers<span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> x<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
        <span>for</span> block <span>in</span> self<span>.</span>blocks<span>:</span>
            x <span>=</span> block<span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>ALBERT shares all parameters across the transformer layers something like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ALBERT</span><span>(</span>nn<span>.</span>Module<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> n_layers<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>__init__<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>

        self<span>.</span>n_layers <span>=</span> n_layers
        self<span>.</span>block <span>=</span> Block<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> x<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
        <span>for</span> _ <span>in</span> self<span>.</span>n_layers<span>:</span>
            x <span>=</span> block<span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By only defining one transformer block and looping around it <code>n_layers</code> times, ALBERT saves the GPU memory that would be used to store the parameters for all the layers. For example, if you share parameters across all transformer layers in the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>B parameter GPT-2, the resulting model will only have about <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>37</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">37</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>M parameters. Since we normally use <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>32</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">32</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> bit floats to store parameters on the GPU, storing the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>B parameter GPT-2 on the GPU will use up about <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>GB of the GPU's memory — that's a pretty big chunk of the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>16</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">16</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>GB of memory that's on a normal V100 GPU already being used up before taking into account the memory needed to store the model's activations as well as any momentum parameters needed by the optimizer. In contrast, the parameter-sharing version would only use up around <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>148</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">148</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>MB of GPU memory.</p>
<p>The authors try applying parameter sharing to BERT and see that it reduces performance but makes it easier to train larger and larger models.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss</h3>
<p>The ALBERT authors add an auxillary loss to help training. Since language modelling is usually done autoregressively, I didn't use this for my custom model.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Removing dropout</h3>
<p>The ALBERT authors remove all dropout from BERT and see that it significantly improves performance.</p>
<hr>
<p>That's pretty much what my idea was: Take GPT-2, add a factorized embedding, share parameters across all transformer layers, remove dropout (I actually missed the part about ALBERT removing dropout until I was pretty far into my work, but I did run one or two runs without dropout to see how that works), and pretrain on a large dataset for a few hundred thousand iterations.</p>
<p>There's no way that I could pretrain something like GPT-2 by myself, so I applied to the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc">Tensorflow Research Cloud</a> (TFRC).</p>
<p><em>The TFRC puts an emphasis on wanting to help researchers from non-traditional backgrounds which makes it an amazing resource for anyone who isn't a "traditional" machine learning researcher. They were willing to give me, a 17 year old with …</em></p></div></div>

<p>Most software is annoying to use. Opening a news article to read 500 words should be instant but takes entire seconds. Try to make a quick update to a Google Doc and you’re waiting even longer before you can type. Hopefully you don’t have to use Jira or Photoshop.</p>

<p>I thought computers were supposed to be nicer than they were in the 90s.</p>

<p>Grizzled vets say that <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/">the good times make us weak</a>. That because we have powerful hardware, modern software is built on top of a bewildering goop of high-level languages, frameworks, and dependencies on dependencies that make even simple things sluggish.</p>

<p>It’s a compelling argument. As craftspeople, we just need to not be lazy, get our shit together, and then we can make nice things.</p>

<p>ヽ(´□｀。)ﾉ</p>

<p>But I think self-flagellation is missing the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>As an industry, we’ve moved from putting engineering innovation and efficiency first, towards prioritizing usability and market-fit. I’m not mad at that. Computers exist to help humans do new things, they should be bicycles for the mind and all that good stuff. But there’s nothing stopping software from being useful <em>and</em> elegantly made.</p>

<p>I mean, except for the way most software companies are organized.</p>

<p>Most company structures are based on the <a href="https://www.hierarchystructure.com/roman-military-hierarchy/">Roman empire military</a>. CEO Caesar says he wants something, and the lieutenant managers below him on the org chart break it down into smaller tasks for the soldiers to accomplish.</p>

<p>On a development team, programmers are the soldiers of these shitty new armies. They open their Jira issues and add whatever feature it says to add, or fix what it says to fix. If I can save time by adding another dependency, or skip a meeting by implementing a mockup exactly as designed, why should I care?</p>

<p>Some people care. Those people suffer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>I now spend 1/4 of my work week fighting dependency hell (after just about each addition of a new package by any other developer on the project), another 1/4 figuring out how the “latest and greatest” tool of the week is best used to do something that would normally take me 5 minutes to do custom (god forbid, not the C-word!), and the remaining half is spent maybe doing actual work. So incredibly frustrating that I’ve just about had it.
</p><p>
I’ve grown to loathe and hate that which I used to adore. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18027977">(Source)</a></p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Building software is nothing like organizing armies in 100 BC. In 2020, we can communicate instantly, victory is ambiguous, and there’s less murder. But most importantly, we’re not conquesting, we’re creating.</p>

<h2 id="creation-moves-differently">Creation moves differently</h2>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2020/mario64-penguin.jpg"></p>

<p>To illustrate this, let’s talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQO2STCbbY">Super Mario 64</a>, the landmark 1996 game that used an unusual new technology: 3D graphics. You might think that Mario 64 was built with tickets and sprints, but, according to interviews, there was no master plan, only the principles that the game should feel good and be fun. They started with just Mario in a small room, and tuned his animations and physics until he felt nice and responsive. After that, the levels were also created as they went, with the designers, developers, and director going back and forth using sketches and prototypes.</p>

<p>Building like this is never a straight line. Ideas and code get left on the cutting room floor because part of innovation is questioning whether what you made <a href="https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=MacPaint_Evolution.txt">should exist</a>. The process is cyclical and iterative, looking something like:</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Good software comes from a vision, combined with conversations not commandments. In a craft-focused environment, care for efficiency, simplicity, and details really do matter. I didn’t leave my last job just because I wanted to make something new. I left because I wanted to make it in a way I could be proud of.</p>

<p>So here’s what’s up, I’m working on my own right now, in a race between my diminishing savings and my typing fingers. But I’m not stressing too much. I’ve got a lot of work to do, but people seem to like what I’m making. Maybe one day though, it won’t just be me. When that happens I’d love to build a small company/collective/<em>thing</em> that’s the best place for creators to work.</p>

		<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>In this post, I summarize some accomplished engineer’s views on error handling.
There is a distinction between errors that are caused by programmer
neglecting bugs and those that represent true error conditions. The
granularity of error checking is also up for debate: Per function? Per module?
Jump to dialog handler in the main message loop? Kill the process and restart?

<h2 id="the-midori-error-model">The Midori Error Model</h2>
<p>Joe Duffy describes in <a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/">The Error
Model</a> the considerations
that went into designing error handling in Midori. He said that they were
guided by these principles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usable</strong>. It must be easy for developers to do the “right” thing in the 
face of error, almost as if by accident. A friend and colleague famously
called this falling into The Pit of Success. The model should not impose
excessive ceremony to write idiomatic code. Ideally, it is cognitively
familiar to our target audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliable</strong>. The Error Model is the foundation of the entire system’s 
reliability. We were building an operating system, after all, so reliability
was paramount. You might even have accused us as obsessively pursuing extreme
levels of it. Our mantra guiding much of the programming model development was
“correct by construction.”</li>
    <li><strong>Performant</strong>. The common case needs to be extremely fast. That means as 
close to zero overhead as possible for success paths. Any added costs for
failure paths must be entirely “pay-for-play.” And unlike many modern systems
that are willing to overly penalize error paths, we had several
performance-critical components for which this wasn’t acceptable, so errors
had to be reasonably fast too.</li>
    <li><strong>Concurrent</strong>. Our entire system was distributed and highly concurrent. 
This raises concerns that are usually afterthoughts in other Error Models.
They needed to be front-and-center in ours.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnosable</strong>. Debugging failures, either interactively or 
after-the-fact, needs to be productive and easy.</li>
    <li><strong>Composable</strong>. At the core, the Error Model is a programming language 
feature, sitting at the center of a developer’s expression of code. As such,
it had to provide familiar orthogonality and composability with other features
of the system. Integrating separately authored components had to be natural,
reliable, and predictable.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe compared different error models against these criteria and came up with
the table below:</p>

<p><img src="https://dannas.name/img/2020/duffy_error_model_table.png" alt="Table of error models"></p>

<p>In the end, he chose checked exception but separated all programmer-error
cases. Those were handled by abandonment - deadly asserts. The compiler could
optimize the code better since it knew exactly which paths could throw (in
contrast to C++ where you have to annotate each function that can not throw).
The syntax is similar to what is now found in Swift and Rust.</p>

<h2 id="the-erlang-approach---let-it-crash">The Erlang Approach - Let it Crash</h2>
<p>The Erlang folks are a bit more hardcore. They don’t get bogged down in
discussions about syntactic structures. Joe Armstrong says in <a href="https://www.softwaretalks.io/v/4611/goto-2018-o-the-dos-and-donts-of-error-handling-o-joe-armstrong">Dos and Don’ts
of error handling</a>:
“You’re correctness theorems aren’t gonna help you if your computer is hit by
lightning. What he meant is that no system runs in isolation and there’s
always the chance of failure. So when errors do happen, they restart the
affected process to a known state and try again.</p>

<p>Fred Hebert describes in <a href="https://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html">The Zen of
Erlang</a> the Let it Crash motto. Erlang
processes are fully isolated and share nothing. So if an error is detected,
the system just kills the process and restarts. But how can that solve anything?
Won’t the same bug just happen over and over again? How to deal with a
configuration file that has the wrong content?</p>

<p>Fred refers to Jim Grays 1985 paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.110.9127&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Why Do Computers Stop and What Can Be
Done About
It?</a>.
There Gray introduces the notion of Heisenbugs and Bohrbugs. In Fred Hebert’s words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, a bohrbug is a bug that is solid, observable, and easily
repeatable. They tend to be fairly simple to reason about. Heisenbugs by
contrast, have unreliable behaviour that manifests itself under certain
conditions, and which may be hidden by the simple act of trying to
observe them. For example, concurrency bugs are notorious for disappearing
when using a debugger that may force every operation in the system to be
serialized.</p>

  <p>Heisenbugs are these nasty bugs that happen once in a thousand, million,
billion, or trillion times. You know someone’s been working on figuring one
out for a while once you see them print out pages of code and go to town on
them with a bunch of markers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a repeatable (Bohr) bug will be easy to reproduce while a transient
(Heisenbug) will be hard. Now, Hebert argues that if you have a bohrbug in your
system’s core features it should be very easy to find before reaching
production. By being repeatable and often on a critical path, you
should encounter them sooner or later, and fix them before shipping.</p>

<p><img src="https://dannas.name/img/2020/hebert_heisen_bohr_bug.png" alt="Bohr vs Heisen Bugs"></p>

<p>Now, Jim Gray’s paper reports that transient errors (heisenbugs) happen all
the time. They are often fixed by restarting. As long as you weed out the
bohrbugs by having proper testing of your releases, the remaining bugs are
often solved by restarting and rolling back to a known state.</p>

<p><img src="https://dannas.name/img/2020/hebert_bugs_restart.png" alt="Bugs handled by Restart"></p>

<h2 id="classification-of-exceptions">Classification of Exceptions</h2>
<p>Eric Lippert gives this taxonomy in <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2008/09/10/vexing-exceptions/">Vexing Exceptions</a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fatal</strong> exceptions are not your fault, you cannot prevent them, and you 
cannot sensibly clean up from them. They almost always happen because the
process is deeply diseased and is about to be put out of its misery. Out of
memory, thread aborted, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Boneheaded</strong> exceptions are your own darn fault, you could have prevented them
and therefore they are bugs in your code. You should not catch them; doing so
is hiding a bug in your code. Rather, you should write your code so that the
exception cannot possibly happen in the first place, and therefore does not
need to be caught. That argument is null, that typecast is bad, that index is
out of range, you’re trying to divide by zero</li>
  <li><strong>Vexing</strong> exceptions are the result of unfortunate design decisions. Vexing
exceptions are thrown in a completely non-exceptional circumstance, and
therefore must be caught and handled all the time. The classic example of a
vexing exception is Int32.Parse, which throws if you give it a string that
cannot be parsed as an integer. Eric recommends calling the Try versions of these
functions instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Exogenous</strong> exceptions appear to be somewhat like vexing exceptions except that
they are not the result of unfortunate design choices. Rather, they are the
result of untidy external realities impinging upon your beautiful, crisp
program logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eric gives this pseduo-C# example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>try {
	using ( File f = OpenFile(filename, ForReading) ) {
	use(f);
	}
} catch (FileNotFoundException) {
	// Handle filename not found
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Can you eliminate the try-catch with this code?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>if (!FileExists(filaname))
    // Handle filename not found
else
    using (File f = ...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>No, you can’t! The new code has a race condition. Eric suggests that you just
bite the bullet and always handle exceptions that indicate unexpected
exogenous conditions.</p>

<h2 id="composing-errors-codes">Composing Errors Codes</h2>
<p>Rob Pike writes in <a href="https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values">Errors are
Values</a> about how to avoid writing
<code>if err != nil {...}</code> all the time in Go code. Instead of sprinkling if
statements, the error handling can be integrated into the type. He gives the
bufio packages’s <code>Scanner</code> as an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>scanner := bufio.NewScanner(input)
for scanner.Scan() {
    token := scanner.Text()
    // process token
}
if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
    // process the error
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The check for errors is only done once. Rob also mentions that the
<code>archive/zip</code> and <code>net/http</code> packages use the same pattern. The <code>bufio</code>
package’s Writer does as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>b := bufio.NewWriter(fd)
b.Write(x)
b.Write(y)
b.Write(z)
// and so on
if b.Flush() != nil {
    return b.Flush()
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fabien Giesen describes a similar pattern for error handling in <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/buffer-centric-io/">Buffer
Centric I/O</a>. And
the pattern is used extensively throughout the Qt framework’s core classes.
Another name for it is sticky errors or error accumulator.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling-granularity">Error Handling Granularity</h2>
<p>Per Vognsen discusses how to do <a href="https://bitwise.handmade.network/episode/bitwise/bitwise006/#5537">course-grained error handling in C using
setjmp/longjmp</a>.
The use case there were for arena allocations and deeply nested recursive
parsers. It’s very similar to how C++ does exception handling, but without the
downsides of the costly C++ memory deallocation on stack unwinding. He goes on to say
that certain classes of push-oriented API’s, that has clear command-query separation,
don’t need to do fine-grained error handling. It’s the same idea as in the
previous section.</p>

<p>Fabien Giesen describes in <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2edc9e9d52a93c126ff486cfb4a2c65b">an aside for a gist note</a>
how he views error handling. He points out that it may be beneficial to only
provide a small set of error codes and that the selection of those should be
dictated by the question “what should I do next?”. E.g. there are many ways a
network connection can fail but providing a giant taxonomy of error codes
won’t help the calling code to decide what to do. Logging should be as
specific as possible but the users of an API just need to decide what to do
next.</p>

<p>Fabien wrote <a href="https://cbloomrants.blogspot.se/2010/06/06-07-10-exceptions.html?showComment=1275971007229#c4849051810850075252">in a blog
comment</a>
 that having stack unwinding do the cleanup on errors is a bad design that
costs lots of resources and is hard to control.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cleanup stack”-based unwinding incurs a cost on every single function, which
means it’s equivalent to checking for error conditions in every single
function. That is a very bad way of implementing error handling; a method that
works much better is to just remember that an error occurred, but substitute
valid data as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>That is, separate “tactical” error handling (which just needs to make sure
your program ends up in a safe and consistent state) from “strategical” error
handling (which is usually at a pretty high level in an app and might involve
user interaction), and try to keep most intermediate layers unaware of both.</p>

  <p>I consider this good practice in general, not least because immediately
escalating error conditions not only makes for hard to understand control
flow, but also a bad user experience. Take broken P4 connections, copies of
large …</p></blockquote></div></div>

  <h2>Space Toggle</h2>
  <p>
    This state machine is built in CSS with a trick called "Space Toggle" discovered to kick off the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a> v2 in April 2020. (though unknown to me, it was previously discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/anatudor">@anatudor</a> about 3 years ago, so credit where due!) You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a><br>
    Or checkout how Space Toggle is used to make responsive, vanilla, CSS much easier in <a href="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">css-media-vars</a> for some more real-world example useage!<br>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<ul><li>Subliminally Standoffish – Don’t be difficult to approach with problems.</li><li>Micro-manager – Don’t be a tyrant on your team.</li><li>The Libertarian – Don’t give your team unlimited freedom.</li><li>Defender of the Poor – Don’t defend your team from every criticism.</li><li>Team Grouch – Don’t complain.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Subliminally Standoffish</strong></h2>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>A standoffish person is someone who is difficult to approach with a problem. If you, as a team lead, are disagreeable to your team members coming with their problems, then it will cost you in the long run.</p>



<h3>Why it’s bad.</h3>



<p>Problems left unsolved will bite you and your team. Leaving something on the long finger will cost time, effort, money and sometimes even weekends. </p>



<p>A backlog of problems that are not getting resolved and that you are not interested in listening to will ultimately make the team unhappy. To have a team lead who is unapproachable is the same, sometimes worse, as not having any team lead at all.</p>



<h3>How to avoid.</h3>



<p>Listen to your team, both as a group and individually. If you hear someone complain about the same thing again and again, sit with them to discuss a solution.</p>



<p>If someone raises a problem that needs some thought at your standup, ask them to stay for 5 mins after the standup is finished. Discuss possible solutions with them. </p>



<p>As the team lead, the responsibility is on you to have at least a plan to fix the problem. If a new recruit is struggling with their work, pair them up with another team member who can coach them through the problem. </p>



<p>Sometimes, you may need to step up to the mark and lead the solution yourself. The team respects you – that respect should be commanded and used in high priority scenarios.</p>



<p>For example, a few ago a critical bug came into our team from a performance test. After a few hours of the team going through different scenarios, it was clear that some direction and leadership was needed. </p>



<p>I helped the team split up the possible solutions, and assigned each solution to 2 or 3 team members. I then stayed with the solution most likely to give an outcome. In this way, we covered more ground and found a solution much quicker than if I had left the team to their own devices.</p>



<h3>Examples and signs.</h3>



<p>How many problems have your team reported to you recently? If the answer is none, then either you have a perfect team (which doesn’t exist), or they are not willing to raise their problems with you. Maybe they feel you don’t care enough about solving their problems. </p>



<p>If the team are requesting support often, and asking your opinion, then you know you are on the right track.</p>



<h3>Tricky part</h3>



<p>If you have a history of being standoffish or snappy, it will take time for your team to trust you again. Take it one day at a time – say specifically that you want to hear more of their problems. Encourage expressing problems at retros and stand-ups in particular – this is where the team are ready to help out each other.</p>



<h2>Micro-manager</h2>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>Control – lots of it, all of the time. Control over individuals tasks, control over bugs, control over work hours…</p>



<p>A micro-manager will ask for more than frequent updates and pick at anything that they think is incorrect or unproductive. They will call for unnecessary updates to make sure every detail reported is on track.</p>



<h3>Why it’s bad.</h3>



<p>A common misconception is that micromanaging is always bad. It’s not. Sometimes it is absolutely necessary. A poor worker who is untrustworthy needs to be micromanaged. Anybody who cannot abide by a professional working structure needs a low level of management.</p>



<p>Having said that, the majority of your team will not have this problem (if they do, you’re in for a rough time). When someone feels micromanaged, they feel not trusted to do their work. As the team lead, if you micromanager your team, it indicates you do not trust them to get their work done. </p>



<p>I once witnessed a team lead chase down a colleague who took regular coffee breaks. She then proceeded to scold him in the hall. This behaviour will&nbsp; not lead to a good working environment.<br></p>



<h3>How to avoid.</h3>



<p>If someone is not pulling their weight, bring it up in a team context. If Patrick is not acting professionally, ask the team – “What can we do to help out Patrick here? Alex – can you join him this morning to try and help progress with his story? Patrick – can you update the team on your progress at the end of the day?”</p>



<p>In this way, you are not singling out Patrick, so he does not feel intimidated. But you are letting him know that the team sees a problem with how he is progressing.<br></p>



<h3>Examples and signs.</h3>



<p>You are constantly correcting and asking information from the the same individual again and again, more so than any other team member. A team member is getting frustrated at giving you so many updates and being told how to work.</p>



<h3>Tricky part.</h3>



<p>Micro-managing can be necessary. You need to balance between effective updates in a team setting while giving the freedom to work effectively.</p>



<h2>The Libertarian</h2>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>The right to do whatever you want, maximum freedom and autonomy,  little to no updates on progress at standups, and no structure on the team as a whole.</p>



<p>While the libertarian philosophy is ideal when talking about government and how one should live their life, it is not a good idea to allow your team absolute freedom in how they work.</p>



<h3>Why it’s bad.</h3>



<p>Effective teams require structure and rules. You must help the team enforce those rules upon themselves. Remember, they are team rules, not yours. You are not a tyrant. A team without structure will perform poorly and get easily distracted.</p>



<h3>How to avoid.</h3>



<p>Encourage the rules within the team. Encourage effective updates in the standups. Ask questions and critique assumptions to encourage people to speak out.</p>



<h3>Example and signs.</h3>



<p>I met an old colleague of mine after he moved jobs into another software developer role at a bank. I asked him how things were going. He said it was fantastic. </p>



<p>His team didn’t have to turn up to work by any set time. They could have their standup remotely from home and come in later on if they wanted. They didn’t practice any of those ‘nasty’ scrum processes. Instead, they worked in an individual Kanban fashion and could take and leave tasks as they wanted. Needless to say, he was on the hunt for another job within 6 months, and the same bank made headlines for some data breach. </p>



<p>The above is an extreme case of ‘anything goes’ and on a macro scale. When it comes to your team, if you see tasks slipping, team members being absent from team meetings or complaints coming in from different team members about other team members then it might be time to revisit the rules within the team.</p>



<h3>Tricky part.</h3>



<p>A good team needs freedom to move. Your job is to help enforce the rules that provide that freedom. Each team will share a common rule set (eg. scrum), but certain teams require additional rules to pull together as a working unit. Your job is to figure out where the freedoms are taken advantage of and to suggest more structure.</p>



<h2>In Defense of the Poor</h2>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>Whether you are an experienced or inexperienced team lead, you will come across colleagues that just don’t want to be there. As the team lead, part of your job is to show off the team. You do this via demos, planning meetings, retrospectives etc. However, we must not confuse showing off the team with blindly defending the team at all costs. Avoid defending a bad decision made by the team or an individual in the team.</p>



<h3>Why it’s bad.</h3>



<p>I have witnessed a few cases where a team lead was adamant that a weaker member of his team did not make a mistake. He seemed to think that by ‘team lead’, his job title included justifying every bad action made by his team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By defending the team’s bad practices or habits, you damage their productivity. In particular, if a team member is consistently making bad judgements, do not defend them beyond doubt.  Teams learn as individuals learn – they need to make mistakes to progress. By not admitting to mistakes and working to fix them, the team is damaged long term.</p>



<p>Furthermore, anyone who scratches beneath the surface of the team will quickly see the fault lines. Most importantly for you, it displays you are an incapable team lead. Your job is not to be ‘nice’ towards your team. It is to create an effective and high performing team.</p>



<h3>How to avoid.</h3>



<p>Avoid ‘defending the poor’ in the first place. Each individual should practice being accountable towards their team. Encourage the team to correct each other at stand-ups and other team meetings. Ask questions like&nbsp; “What should we have done to avoid this mistake?”.</p>



<p>If the issue persists, particularly with individuals who are consistently making mistakes, you may need to consult with your line manager. Sometimes it is simply the case that certain people are not fit for the team or the line of work. </p>



<p>If you do have a weak link in the team and you are asked to explain to an external colleague (eg. manager), respond with something like: </p>



<blockquote><p>We recognise this is an issue – we have taken a retro internally and are working on a plan to fix it.</p></blockquote>



<p>Remember – don’t mention individuals. The team made the mistake, so you must express the mistake as a whole, not on an individual basis.</p>



<h3>Examples &amp; Signs</h3>



<p>Gary has been arriving late to meetings and is merging faulty and untested code into the master branch. Your manager asked you what you were doing about it. You defended your team’s pride saying that Gary turns up to all team meetings and is an excellent worker and team player. Your manager walks away unconvinced.</p>



<p>Notice how you have not solved the problem – you have essentially said “I don’t want to know about it”. Your manager won’t thank you for that.</p>



<h3>Tricky part</h3>



<p>Very often, bad performers need to be called out. But you are the team lead so it is not up to you to call them …</p></article></div>

<p>In this post I’ll be investigating <em>compressed sensing</em> (also known as compressive sensing, compressive sampling, and sparse sampling) in Python. Since the idea of compressed sensing can be applied in wide array of subjects, I’ll be focusing mainly on how to apply it in one and two dimensions to things like sounds and images. Specifically, I will show how to take a highly incomplete data set of signal samples and reconstruct the underlying sound or image. It is a very powerful technique.</p>
<h2><mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> vs. <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> Fitting</h2>
<hr>
<p>As you might know, there are many different types of norms. Perhaps the most common and widely recognized one is the <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> norm:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$\lVert\vec x\rVert_2=\left(\sum_{i=0}^n x_i^2 \right)^{1/2}$$</mathjax></p>
<p>The <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> norm is nice because it is easily calculated, easily differentiated, and it has intuitive appeal (e.g., the norm of a vector is its length). A lot of very important algorithms and methods rely on the <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax>, including least squares fitting.</p>
<p>That said, the <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> norm isn’t the goto solution for everything. The other norms also have many interesting and useful properties. Consider the <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> norm:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$\lVert \vec x\rVert_1=\sum_{i=0}^n \lvert x_i\rvert $$</mathjax></p>
<p>Instead of squaring each element, it simply takes its absolute value. Although the absolute value is annoying in the sense that it often introduces discontinuities in its derivatives, it does have some unique properties when compared to the squaring that takes place in the <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> norm. Compressed sensing is all about exploiting these properties.</p>
<p>Let’s visualize some data with Python to see what I’m talking about.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># make sure you've got the following packages installed</span>
<span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>
<span>import</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>as</span> <span>mpl</span>
<span>import</span> <span>matplotlib.pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>
<span>import</span> <span>scipy.optimize</span> <span>as</span> <span>spopt</span>
<span>import</span> <span>scipy.fftpack</span> <span>as</span> <span>spfft</span>
<span>import</span> <span>scipy.ndimage</span> <span>as</span> <span>spimg</span>
<span>import</span> <span>cvxpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>cvx</span>
</pre></div>


<p>First what we’re going to do is create some arbitrary linear data including some noise. Let’s use the made-up equation:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$y=\frac{1}{5}x+3+\epsilon$$</mathjax></p>
<p>where <mathjax>$\epsilon$</mathjax> is some normally distributed error with standard deviation <mathjax>$\sigma=0.1$</mathjax>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># generate some data with noise</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>.</span><span>uniform</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>15</span><span>))</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.1</span> <span>*</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>.</span><span>randn</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let’s fit two lines to the data samples. For the first line, we’ll use the <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> norm as the criterion for a good fit; for the second line, we’ll use the <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> norm.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># find L1 line fit</span>

<span># find L2 line fit</span>
<span>l2_fit</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x0</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>power</span><span>(</span><span>x0</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x0</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
<span>xopt2</span> <span>=</span> <span>spopt</span><span>.</span><span>fmin</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>=</span><span>l2_fit</span><span>,</span> <span>x0</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>args</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img src="http://www.pyrunner.com/media/uploads/images/compressed-sensing-python/output_5_2.png"></p>
<p>Notice that both of the fits seem to do a pretty good job fitting the data. Sure, they don’t line up exactly, but they both are reasonable approximations given the noise. </p>
<p>Now, let’s get a tad crazy and add some outliers. In other words, let’s perturb a couple of the points, moving them far away from the lines. This isn’t actually all that out of the ordinary if you think about it. Outliers frequently occur in real world data, causing all kinds of headaches.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># adjust data by adding outlyers</span>
<span>y2</span> <span>=</span> <span>y</span><span>.</span><span>copy</span><span>()</span>
<span>y2</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>y2</span><span>[</span><span>13</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>3</span>

<span># refit the lines</span>
<span>xopt12</span> <span>=</span> <span>spopt</span><span>.</span><span>fmin</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>=</span><span>l1_fit</span><span>,</span> <span>x0</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>args</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y2</span><span>))</span>

</pre></div>


<p><img src="http://www.pyrunner.com/media/uploads/images/compressed-sensing-python/output_7_2.png"></p>
<p>When we re-plot the <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> fits we see something interesting: the <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> fit remained true to the overall trend in the data, while the <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> fit seemed to get “corrupted” by the outliers. Why does this happen? It comes down to the fact that <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> error gets squared, while <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> error does not. When you fit a line to data using an <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> interpretation of error, the displacement of outliers has a disproportional impact because their already-big errors are get getting squared. Just look at the distance of the two outliers in our example and imagine squaring them – of course it’s not surprising that the <mathjax>$L^2$</mathjax> line gets skewed!</p>
<p>However, when using an <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> interpretation of error, the outliers contribute no more than their displacement. The result is a cleaner fit that more closely matches our intuition of what a good fit should look like. It’s this interesting property that opens the door to compressed sensing.</p>
<h2>Reconstruction of a Simple Signal</h2>
<hr>
<p>In this example (borrowed from Kutz<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>), we will create an artificial sound wave, sample 10% of it, and reconstruct the original signal from the sample of 10%. This is one dimensional compressed sensing.</p>
<p>First, create a signal of two sinusoids.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># sum of two sinusoids</span>
<span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>5000</span>
<span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>linspace</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>1394</span> <span>*</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>pi</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>3266</span> <span>*</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>pi</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
<span>yt</span> <span>=</span> <span>spfft</span><span>.</span><span>dct</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>norm</span><span>=</span><span>'ortho'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img src="http://www.pyrunner.com/media/uploads/images/compressed-sensing-python/output_10_1.png"></p>
<p>In the plots above, we see that the signal has a clear pattern, yet is non-trivial. The plots in the top row are of the signal in the temporal domain at different scales. The plots in the bottom row are of the signal in the spectral domain (i.e., the signal’s frequency content). Considering the frequency domain in particular, we note that the spectrum is mostly zero except for the two spikes representing the two sine frequencies.</p>
<p>Now imagine sampling 10% of the temporal signal (see below). You’d have a data set that, to the naked eye, would look like nonsense. The underlying signal is would still be the same, as would be its frequency content (mostly zeros, with the exception of two spikes). One might ask if it is somehow possible to extract those two dominant frequencies from the incomplete data so that we might reconstruct the signal? The answer is yes!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># extract small sample of signal</span>
<span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>500</span> <span># 10% sample</span>

<span>y2</span> <span>=</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>ri</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img src="http://www.pyrunner.com/media/uploads/images/compressed-sensing-python/output_12_1.png"></p>
<p>Compressed sensing in this context is made possible by the fact that the signal’s frequency content is highly sparse. This is where the <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> norm comes into play. What we want to do is, out of all possible signals, locate the <em>simplest</em> one that matches up with the known data. In other words, we want to use a minimization routine to find a set of frequencies satisfying two conditions: (a) the underlying signal matches up exactly (or as closely as possible) with that of our data; and (b) the <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> norm of the frequencies is minimized. Such a routine will yield a sparse solution – exactly what we want.</p>
<p>In Python, there are a couple ways to accomplish this. Perhaps the easiest is to utilize the convex optimization library <a href="http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/">CVXPY</a>. Use the code below to minimize the norm of the signal’s frequencies with the constraint that candidate signals should match up exactly with our incomplete samples.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># create idct matrix operator</span>

<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>prob</span><span>.</span><span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>verbose</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might be asking: <em>what the hell is that <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> matrix?</em> Well, it’s the key to the whole party. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In order to perform the minimization, we must somehow finagle our problem into a linear system of equations:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$A x=b$$</mathjax></p>
<p>Specifically, we want to derive a matrix <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> that can be multiplied with a solution candidate <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> to yield <mathjax>$b$</mathjax>, a vector containing the data samples. In the context of our current problem, the candidate solution <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> exists in the frequency domain, while the known data <mathjax>$b$</mathjax> exists in the temporal domain. Clearly, the matrix <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> performs both a sampling and a transformation from spectral to temporal domains.</p>
<p>Compressed sensing really comes down to being able to correctly derive the <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> operator. Fortunately, there’s a methodology. Start off by letting <mathjax>$f$</mathjax> be the target signal in vector form (if your signal is 2-dimensional or higher, flatten it) and <mathjax>$\phi$</mathjax> be the sampling matrix. Then:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$b=\phi f$$</mathjax></p>
<p>Now let <mathjax>$\psi$</mathjax> be the matrix that transforms a signal from the spectral domain to the temporal domain. Given the solution <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> in the frequency domain, it follows that:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$\psi x=f$$</mathjax></p>
<p>Combining the two equations yields:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$A x=b\quad \text{where}\ A\equiv \phi\psi$$</mathjax></p>
<p>So, <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> is simply made up of rows sampled from the domain transform matrix <mathjax>$\psi$</mathjax>. The <mathjax>$\psi$</mathjax> matrix is easy to construct – it is the inverse discrete cosine transform acting upon the columns of the identity matrix. The matrix product <mathjax>$\psi x$</mathjax> is the equivalent to doing <code>idct(x)</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve constructed the <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> matrix and run the minimization, we can reconstruct the signal by transforming the solution out of the frequency domain and back into the temporal. Below, on the left, is the original signal and its frequency content. On the right is our <mathjax>$L^1$</mathjax> approximation. I’d say that’s pretty good for only using 10% of the data!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># reconstruct signal</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>array</span><span>(</span><span>vx</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>

</pre></div>


<p><img src="http://www.pyrunner.com/media/uploads/images/compressed-sensing-python/output_16_0.png"></p>
<p>One problem that stands out is that the quality of the reconstruction degrades noticeably at and around <mathjax>$t=0$</mathjax>. This is probably due to our sample interval violating the periodic boundary condition requirements of the cosine transform. Of course, given an arbitrary signal sample without any prior knowledge of its nature, it would be hard <em>not</em> to violate periodic boundary conditions. The good news is that now we have some very clear indications of the true signal’s frequencies. If desired, we could go back and resample the signal within an interval that satisfies periodic boundaries.</p>
<h2>Reconstruction of an Image (a 2D Signal)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Now let’s use what we learned from the 1-dimensional case to do compressed sensing in 2-dimensions. This is where the real fun begins because we can now try and reconstruct images.</p>
<p>Below, we will use exactly the same methodology as before to randomly sample and reconstruct the image <em>Waterfall</em> by M. C. Escher (approx. 1200 by 1600 pixels). Due to memory limitations imposed by the <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> matrix, we’ll start off by considering a downsized version of …</p></div></div>

<p>By DANIEL STONE, MD (3)</p>



<p>President Trump’s wobbly walk down a ramp at his recent West Point visit along with his awkward&nbsp; two-handed drink from a water glass have stirred recent speculation about a possible undisclosed neurologic issue such as early Parkinson’s Disease.&nbsp; Although no specific conclusions can be drawn from these observations, they raise important questions regarding the President’s health. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump would not be the first president to conceal health problems.&nbsp; Toward the end of Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency, his blood pressure rose alarmingly.&nbsp; As no drug treatments existed his doctors could recommend only that he stop smoking, lose weight and avoid dietary salt.&nbsp; Less than six months after an un-knowing public re-elected him to a record fourth term, FDR predictably suffered a fatal stroke.&nbsp; The public was similarly unaware of John Kennedy’s Addison’s Disease, a condition that required daily injections to replace the adrenal hormones his body could not make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The known facts about Trump’s health are concerning enough. &nbsp; Despite taking a statin drug to reduce his cholesterol, Mr. Trump’s age and risk factors at his 2018 physical predicted a 16.7%&nbsp; risk of a heart attack over ten years, as estimated by a standard American College of Cardiology risk calculator.&nbsp; Trump was taking a statin at the time of that exam to lower his cholesterol.&nbsp; As cholesterol levels on a statin may not reflect risk as accurately as un-treated levels, the calculator may under-estimate his true risk. &nbsp; &nbsp; Although Trump’s doctors tout his health they seemed to be concerned about cardiovascular risk as they subsequently quadrupled his statin dosage, placing him highest dose of the most potent statin available. &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, the President’s annual exam revealed that his weight recently drifted up into the obese range, which means additional coronary disease risk along with an increased chance of stroke, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and several types of cancers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp; Trump’s judgment on health issues could be questioned given his use of finasteride, a medication used to prevent baldness.&nbsp; The drug, which can cause loss of libido and breast growth in men, was the subject of an FDA warning in 2011 regarding high grade prostate cancer.&nbsp; Although information published in 2019 was reassuring regarding prostate cancer risk, Trump has used the drug since at least 2016, well before this information was available.&nbsp; His apparent willingness to take a vanity drug despite known serious health risks should cause concern regarding his awareness that presidential health issues are more than mere matters of personal preference. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the “wobble-gait’ observations are non-specific they raised legitimate concerns about Parkinson’s Disease.&nbsp; Caused by insufficient levels of brain neurotransmitters, the condition slows body movements, disrupts gait stability and produces tremor.&nbsp; As the disease progresses 30% to 40% of Parkinson’s patients develop dementia.&nbsp; 2% of men the President’s age have Parkinson’s and the prevalence increases with time.&nbsp; Even more concerning than the thought of a president with Parkinson’s Disease would be a President taking medication for Parkinson’s Disease .&nbsp; Carbidopa/levodopa, the most commonly used drug, can be associated with mood changes.&nbsp; Other commonly used Parkinson’s drugs are associated with impulsive behaviors, not something that we need to see more of in this President. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The President’s awkward two-handed drink of water is less directly concerning.&nbsp; Parkinson’s Disease produces a hand tremor during rest. &nbsp; Tremors that occur during movement, like drinking from a glass, are&nbsp; “action tremors” which are common and rarely debilitating.&nbsp; But Trump’s use of his offhand to steady the other is the sort of maneuver one might use to suppress an action tremor.&nbsp; This practice might be entirely innocent, but the possibility that the President might be trying to suppress a tremor, like his excessive attempts explain away the gait issue, might lead reasonable people to wonder whether he has something to hide.</p>



<p>The President’s record on health disclosures provides further reason for concern.&nbsp; Dr. Harold Bornstein, Trump’s personal physician, released a statement in 2016 that Trump’s health was “astonishingly excellent” and that he would be the “healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”&nbsp; The Trumpian sound of the bombast in the physician’s letter makes more sense after Bornstein’s revelation that the candidate dictated the statement. &nbsp; Bornstein subsequently claimed that Trump’s White House had raided his office and taken all of Trump’s records without following standard procedures. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the evidence that Trump harbors a significant neurologic diagnosis is less than convincing it still raises serious concerns.&nbsp; In health matters, as with his personal&nbsp; tax issues, the absence of transparency and the reliance on public relations strategies should concern the public. &nbsp; Regardless of his current neurologic status, anyone with Trump’s risk factors and age would face substantial risk of debilitating&nbsp; health problems over the course of a four-year term.&nbsp; Given what we know, can the public have confidence that a medically disabled Trump would reveal serious health issues&nbsp; and allow Vice-Presidential succession under the terms of the 25<sup>th</sup> Amendment? &nbsp; Ultimately, the presidential health issue for Americans to consider is not whether Trump can walk straight but whether he can talk straight. &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591848729219073">hacks</a> are the last straw. We need to exit Twitter.</p><p>But you may be invested in Twitter! So what do you do? Here's one recipe for <em>gradual</em> exit.</p><ol><li>Step one is to set up an (optionally pseudonymous) newsletter at your <em>own</em> custom domain using the instructions <a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">here</a>. You can do this in an hour and maintain it for less than $30 per month. Then only tweet out posts from your site, using your domain name as a simple form of authentication.</li><li>Step two is to start building your membership list at your own site. If you want, help us review <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export">open source tools</a> to export your Twitter following to an email list and <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1284155565770498050">mass delete any DMs</a>.</li><li>And step three is to get off Twitter all together, and start building a decentralized media ecosystem that combines the sovereignty of individual domain names with the community of social networking. The v1 of that is a simple joint RSS feed that aggregates multiple independent newsletters, but we can get much more <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1280005821028397057">sophisticated</a> <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb">with</a> <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-state-of-the-art-of-decentralized-web-part-4-212732f74894">tech</a> <a href="https://gun.eco/docs/dWeb-The-Decentralized-Web">for</a> <a href="https://ens.domains/">the</a> <a href="https://handshake.org/">decentralized</a> <a href="https://ipfs.io/">web</a>. It may turn out that what we build helps reform Twitter itself, but at a minimum it will present an alternative.</li></ol><p>Before we get there though, let's go through the problems with Twitter.</p><h2 id="the-problems-with-twitter">The Problems with Twitter</h2><p>It's not just the hack. There are several overlapping issues with Twitter around security, authentication, pseudonymity, distribution, incentives, and culture.</p><ul><li><em>Twitter is insecure</em>. It was a mistake to think that personal security could compensate for the fundamental flaw of centralized web services: anyone who gains control over twitter.com gains control over your account. We knew this already from the <a href="http://archive.is/Bq5qi">2017 incident</a> and the <a href="http://archive.is/wip/scJMn">Jack Hack</a>. But now the most prominent people and companies in the world (Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Musk, Apple, Uber, among others) have been <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591848729219073">openly and publicly hacked</a>. Tomorrow you may be the victim. And unlike these worthies, you may be <em>silently</em> and <em>privately</em> hacked. Perhaps you already have been.</li><li><em>Twitter is not authenticated</em>. It was a mistake to trust Twitter's centralized verification process to validate everything posted to the service. There weren't any <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp#:~:text=A%20digital%20wallet%20stores%20the,to%20use%20the%20private%20key.">digital signatures</a> to help establish whether the messages were really coming from a user-controlled device, or faked by a central server.</li><li><em>Twitter is not fully pseudonymous</em>. It was a mistake to use our real names everywhere online, particularly on Twitter. It made us vulnerable to personal and physical attacks. Social media mobs can swarm your real name online and cancel you in real life. Doxxing can heighten the danger by making threats <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/reflections-upon-a-swatting/">materialize in</a> <a href="https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md">meatspace</a>. Pseudonymity is a better default, especially now that we can <a href="http://www.marknagelberg.com/notes-on-the-pseudonymous-economy-balaji-srinivasan/">earn under a pseudonym</a>.</li><li><em>Twitter is a distribution chokepoint</em>. It was a mistake to outsource our distribution to Twitter. Twitter users don't fully control their reach, brand, or monetization. You can be <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-reveals-how-it-ranks-tweets-in-search-results/263869/">downranked</a> or <a href="http://archive.is/mhgyB">deplatformed</a> at any time, just like you can on YouTube and other centralized platforms. Owning your <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465992-How-do-I-export-my-email-or-subscriber-list-">own</a> <a href="http://locals.com/">email</a> <a href="https://ghost.org/members">list</a> is a far better alternative.</li><li><em>Twitter doesn't create wealth</em>. It was a mistake to have so many people spending so much time on something that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1271834488998440961">arguably</a> destroys more wealth than it creates. Because by default, you don't create wealth on Twitter. You may create wealth <em>for</em> Twitter, or for the media corporations whose links are circulated, but not for yourself or for others. There's no sense of economic alignment with other users, no sense of mutual obligation.</li><li><em>Twitter turns society into Twitter</em>. It was a mistake to let Twitter set up the incentives for our society. It's not good for the world when the one thing every prominent person knows how to do is <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1272653587617701888">fight</a> each other on Twitter for likes and followers. It has converted society into a zero-sum status game played by elites with real consequences. Every day, blue checks compete for a finite pie of attention with ever more sensational posts. There is instant feedback on what is popular, but none on what is true. The lack of economics, the presence of real names, the toxic culture, and the UX itself all encourage constant fighting.</li></ul><p>Now, let me qualify these comments. I personally have gotten <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1271834488998440961">enormous value</a> out of Twitter, despite all the points above. After all, you only critique the services you use!</p><p>And to be clear, Jack Dorsey is a phenomenal entrepreneur. I respect everything he's done and the team that he's built. It's hard to build one multibillion dollar company, let alone <a href="http://archive.is/wip/bu6hJ">two</a>. He's done immense good for the world overall, both through his <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1247616214769086465">personal generosity</a> and his startup vehicles. And I also don't wish any Twitter employee ill, as many of them are truly great people and I know how hard this stuff is.</p><p>Moreover, even after this hack, Twitter will likely continue to be an important internet battlefield for quite sometime. It's just too easy, too convenient. And it may turn out that whatever is built to exit Twitter will end up interfacing with Twitter itself, via their <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky">decentralized protocol</a>, if only as a form of training wheels to help people get off. Hopefully this can be done in a win-win way, such that Twitter and its employees are incentivized to allow people to gradually exit and fix the issues on the centralized service.</p><p>But it's past time for us to start building something better, that keeps the good aspects of Twitter (the serendipitous learning, the fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1214585024772788224">people</a>) but filters the bad. That may mean exiting to our own domains and then networking them into decentralized media.</p><h2 id="decentralization-starts-with-a-domain">Decentralization Starts with a Domain</h2><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter--1-.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Can we network together websites into decentralized media with something deeper than links?</figcaption></figure><p>I may be wrong about this, but I don't think a "better Twitter" starts with a service which is simply a clone of Twitter except with a different community. I think it starts with a community of independent (and independently monetizable) domains that we network together in novel ways, to build <em>decentralized media</em>.</p><p>Towards this end, the first step in gradually exiting Twitter is to set up your own paid newsletter at a custom domain (<a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">instructions here</a>) and restrict yourself mainly to tweeting out posts. This does require more effort than writing 280 characters! But that's why it's good. Effort helps restore your attention span and improves average post quality. And in addition to the other benefits, the link to your domain doubles as a simple alternative to a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp#:~:text=A%20digital%20wallet%20stores%20the,to%20use%20the%20private%20key.">digital signature</a>, a way for people to see that the content is authentically yours. </p><p>The medium-term step is to develop <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export">tools</a> to migrate your followers off Twitter to an email list, and to mass delete all DMs as a precautionary step. If you want to help review some existing tools towards this end, we're working on it <a href="https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export/issues/1">here</a>.</p><p>The long-term step is to start addressing the issues with Twitter by knitting these individual domains together into an open source decentralized media ecosystem. That means addressing:</p><ul><li>Security by encouraging people to post from their own domains</li><li>Community by building a network around multiple domains</li><li>Authentication by combining domains with digital signatures</li><li>Distribution via memberships and email lists</li><li>Incentives by baking in monetization and economic alignment from the beginning</li><li>Mobs by recommending pseudonymity by default</li><li>Culture by encouraging physical norms of civility</li></ul><p>Crucially, unlike past efforts our goal would be to build this <em>community-first</em> rather than <em>technology-first</em>. Specifically, once we get enough paid newsletters set up at their own domains, we can experiment with new decentralized web technologies for linking them together. If you submit your URL to <a href="https://forms.gle/xqvAFgW43Hc7rVzJA">this form</a>, we'll see if we can form a community. We'll probably start with a joint <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feed and then <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/">get more sophisticated</a>.</p><p>Oh, and you can signal that you're interested in decentralized media by changing your name on Twitter to your URL, as <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">follows</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Exiting Twitter and building decentralized media will be a long project and we aren't assured of success. But this journey of a thousand miles begins with a single newsletter at your own domain! So <a href="https://balajis.com/set-up-a-paid-newsletter-at-your-own-domain/">set yours up</a> now. </p><p>It's time to start gradually exiting Twitter.</p>

<p><a href="http://seattlechannel.org/videos?videoid=x115392">Earlier this week</a> a pair of advocacy organizations, Decriminalize Seattle and King County Equity Now, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6989571-Decrim-Seattle-KCEN-Blueprint.html">presented</a> their proposed “blueprint” of how to reduce SPD’s footprint and redirect funds to a variety of community-led organizations that could eventually take over response to 911 calls and other community responses that SPD is currently handling — often by default. Their proposal’s strength is in the detail of programs they want to fund, as well as in identifying key success factors such as building organizational and growth capacities in organizations that have been running on shoestring budgets for years. But the weakness of their proposal is in their laundry list of recommendations for cuts to make to SPD:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freeze hiring. Any planned hiring, including for individuals in the training pipeline,</em><br>
<em>should be cancelled.</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate funds for recruitment and retention, including bonuses for new hires.</em></li>
<li><em>Remove the Office of Collaborative Policing, including Navigation Team. While some</em><br>
<em>programs of this office, along with their administrative infrastructure, should be</em><br>
<em>eliminated altogether, others could be moved to a civilian-controlled city agency.</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate: Navigation Team, Community Outreach Administration</em></li>
<li><em>Transfer out of SPD control: Crisis Intervention Response, Community Service Officers</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate spending on new equipment</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate Data-driven policing</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate spending on North Precinct Capital Project</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate Professional Services -Including:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Photo Enforcement</em></li>
<li><em>Sworn Hiring in HR</em></li>
<li><em>Recruitment and Retention</em></li>
<li><em>Community Outreach</em></li>
<li><em>Implicit Bias Training</em></li>
<li><em>Communications</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Cut SPD’s spending on Homeland Security (a misnamed unit that is mostly assigned to</em><br>
<em>large events like Bumbershoot)</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate SWAT Team funding</em></li>
<li><em>End contracts with private firms that defend SPD and the City against police misconduct</em><br>
<em>lawsuits</em></li>
<li><em>Eliminate SPD’s travel and training budget</em></li>
<li><em>End overtime pay, including for Emphasis Patrols</em></li>
<li><em>Reduce patrol staffing, with corresponding reduction in administrative staffing</em></li>
<li><em>Transfer 911 dispatch out of Seattle Police Department to civilian control.</em></li>
<li><em>Transfer traffic/parking enforcement out of SPD control.</em></li>
<li><em>Transfer Office of Police Accountability out of SPD control.</em></li>
<li><em>Transfer Office of Emergency Management out of SPD control.</em></li>
<li><em>Reduce administrative costs in line with the above cuts, including corresponding cuts to</em><br>
<em>the office of the Chief of Police, Leadership and Administration, and Administrative</em><br>
<em>Operations.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>While it’s a delightful wish-list, doing many of these things currently runs afoul of local and state laws, not to mention the Consent Decree and the several labor contracts covering groups of employees within SPD.&nbsp; Let’s review.</p>
<h4>The City Charter</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/cityclerk/legislation-and-research/seattle-municipal-code-and-city-charter">The Charter of the City of Seattle</a> is the founding law of the city, much as the State Constitution and the U.S. Constitution are respectively for the state and nation. changing it requires approval of the City Council, the Mayor, and the voters of the city in an election.</p>
<p><a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=THCHSE_ARTVIDEPO_S1ORPODE">Article VI, Section 1</a> states:</p>
<p><em>The Police Department shall consist of a Chief of Police and as many subordinate officers and employees as may by ordinance be prescribed. There shall be maintained adequate police protection in each district of the City.</em></p>
<p>While the Charter does not define “adequate police protection,” any major cuts to SPD — such as a 50% cut to sworn officers — would require the city to show that the police presence is still “adequate.” And that determination would likely end up being reviewed in court by legal challenges to the defunding plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=THCHSE_ARTXVIPESYCISE_S9LANE">Article XVI, Section 9</a> reads:</p>
<p><em>The right of City employees to bargain collectively, through representatives of their own choosing, shall not be abrogated by the City, but no collectively bargained contract shall become effective without ratification by the City Council. The City Council shall not ratify any contract which is inconsistent with this Charter.</em></p>
<p>The City cannot simply skip over the requirement to engage in collective bargaining with unions representing employees in SPD, on any topics that are mandatory for collective bargaining. State law, as we will see, has similar language, and details the mandatory topics.</p>

<h4>Seattle Municipal Code</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/cityclerk/legislation-and-research/seattle-municipal-code-and-city-charter">Seattle Municipal Code</a> is under the Council’s direct control, so ordinances here can get addressed; but there are a lot of them that are relevant to SPD, and many of those — particularly personnel-related ones — also apply to other City employees so untangling how they apply to SPD may not be easy.</p>
<p>Chapter 3.28 relates to the Police Department. Chapter 3.29 is the police accountability legislation passed in 2017 that is still somewhat in legal limbo as it reads on provisions of the Consent Decree.</p>
<p><a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT3AD_SUBTITLE_IIDEOF_CH3.28PODE_SUBCHAPTER_IPODERE_3.28.100TRPAMERE">SMC 3.28.100</a> says that parking meter enforcement is the responsibility of SPD.</p>
<p><a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT3AD_SUBTITLE_IIDEOF_CH3.28PODE_SUBCHAPTER_IVCOSEOFPR_3.28.420AU">SMC 3.28.420</a> authorizes the Community Service Officer Program within SPD. If the program were to be moved elsewhere, this would need to be revised.</p>
<p>SMC 4.08 is the rules for the public safety civil service system, governing most personnel functions related to sworn police officers (not civilians), as well as to fire department personnel.</p>
<p><a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT4PE_CH4.08PUSACISE">SMC 4.08.020</a> states:</p>
<p><em>All appointments and promotions to Police and Fire Department positions, retention therein and removal therefrom shall be based on merit and according to the policies and procedures hereinafter specified or according to the procedures regarding the promotions of police officers and sergeants set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the City and the exclusive bargaining agent of such employees, as approved by ordinance, to the extent such procedures are inconsistent with those set forth herein.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT4PE_CH4.08PUSACISE_4.08.140RIEM">SMC 4.08.140</a> (C) further reads:</p>
<p><em>Employees shall not be demoted, suspended, or discharged except only for cause, and they may appeal such adverse actions as specified in this chapter.</em></p>
<p>while <a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT4PE_CH4.08PUSACISE_4.08.180COBA">SMC 4.08.180</a> says:</p>
<p><em>The adoption of this chapter shall not affect the provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement.</em></p>
<p>(in other words: terms in legally negotiated collective bargaining agreements take precedence over the text of SMC 4.08)</p>
<p>The 2017 <a href="http://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3041612&amp;GUID=189886AB-6C46-438A-AB56-DA45AE4FCD7B&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">police accountability legislation</a> also has some relevant passages. SMC 3.29.105 explicitly says that OPA is organized with the Seattle Police Department to ensure that it has full access to SPD-controlled information under state law (we’ll revisit this point later).</p>
<p>Also, SMC 3.29.120 and 3.29.430 relate to the OPA Director supervising sworn officers working in OPA; that becomes more difficult (though not impossible) if OPA is outside of SPD. There are good arguments on both sides as to whether OPA should continue to have sworn officers serving as investigators; this whole area will need to be debated at length.</p>

<h4>State law</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx">Revised Code of Washington</a> (aka RCW) has several laws that pertain to how cities are run, and specifically to law enforcement agencies and personnel.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=10.97">RCW 10.97</a> is the Criminal Records Privacy Act. It restricts information on arrests, pending charges, and criminal records that police departments can disseminate out and sets strict confidentiality rules. There are exceptions that may allow the city to move OPA out of SPD yet still preserve full and complete access to records, but it will be much more difficult. Any other groups spun out of SPD that might require access to that information will have similar challenges. To the extent that private community-led organizations are dispatched instead of public employees, access to information becomes even more problematic.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.56">RCW 41.56</a> is the collection of laws governing collective bargaining for all public employees in the state. There are sections that refer specifically to public-safety public employees, including the police.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.56.030">RCW 41.56.030</a> includes the list of topics that for which collective bargaining is required, i.e. the city can’t just impose its own rules. They include “wages, hours and working conditions.”&nbsp; That includes a wide swath of topics, including reorganizations, moving groups out of the department, layoffs, reducing pay, overtime rules, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.20&amp;full=true">RCW 41.20</a> defines the police pension system for first-class cities such as Seattle. This is an incredibly important benefit for police officers that many have spent years paying into, hoping to get to the magic 25 years. What happens to the pension benefits for anyone laid off from SPD, or reorg’ed out of the department, will be an important issue to resolve.</p>

<h4>Collective bargaining agreements</h4>
<p>There are several CBA’s that apply to groups of SPD employees. That includes police officers up through sergeant (SPOG), police management (SPMA), parking enforcement officers (SPEOG), and 911 call center employees who also have their own agreement. Other classes of civilian employees within SPD are represented by different unions, who negotiate separate contracts. According to a spokesperson for the Mayor’s Office, the city has already received a demand from SPEOG “to bargain on all mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining that would be impacted by the move of SPEOG to SDOT. Failure to bargain will result in a [unfair labor practice complaint].”</p>
<p>Making significant changes to SPD will probably require negotiating with all of these unions — and that will take at least months. the Mayor’s spokesperson said, “By starting the conversation now, we do think many of these can be accomplished in late 2020/early 2021.” Making legislative or administrative changes before those negotiations are complete could result in more unfair labor practice charges, as we saw in 2017 with the passage of the police accountability legislation, and eventually …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
    <p><br>
I’ve been thinking about writing this article for a bit, but have been most prompted by a post grandly titled “<a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html">Async Python is not faster</a>”. The post was rooted with some good motivations and observations, but also fell somewhat into a polarising mode of discussion that I’d like to see our communities try to move beyond.</p>

<p>Async concurrency necessarily brings with it an element of ecosystem split, and this can mean that it’s a bit of a divisive area to try to have conversations within.</p>

<p>However I think we could probably benefit from a bit more recognition of where there is shared ground. And in areas where there’s less clarity, to be able to have constructive conversations around the relative merits in differing approaches.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="-why-you-shouldnt-care-about-performance">★ Why you shouldn’t care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>If you’re starting a new project, and choosing a python async framework vs a python sync framework, then any “performance” metrics around the frameworks <em>almost certainly don’t actually matter</em>, and are almost always a nonsense point of debate.</p>

<p>What is <em>actually</em> critical to your business is the development experience and strength of the surrounding ecosystem. What is your time to market going to be? How will the maintenance overhead be? How robust and evolvable is your codebase?</p>

<h3 id="-why-you-might-care-about-performance">★ Why you might care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Having said that, there <em>are</em> a small portion of cases where the performance characteristics are a valid consideration. Particularly if your web framework makes lots of outgoing HTTP requests or other networking and I/O.</p>

<p>It’s important for the Python ecosystem that it ought to compare favourably to other dynamic languages in domains where async is beneficial. We don’t want to be in a position where “we’re using JavaScript because we believe it’ll scale up better” is a valid market blocker vs. choosing Python.</p>

<h3 id="-what-were-talking-about-when-we-talk-about-performance">★ What we’re talking about when we talk about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Like-for-like a single async function call in isolation will be marginally slower than a plain function call. That’s not contentious.</p>

<p>What we’re actually interested in is how <em>efficiently</em> we can interleave multiple concurrent tasks. In I/O bound systems co-operative concurrency (async) performs more efficiently under high concurrency than threaded concurrency (sync). Again, not contentious.</p>

<p>Again - Async Python is not faster. It <em>is</em> more efficient. Which will <em>tend</em> to mean that on I/O bound systems, the latency will <em>continue</em> to remain low even as the level of concurrency increases.</p>

<h3 id="-there-are-no-good-benchmarks">★ There are no good benchmarks.</h3>

<p>JSON “hello world” benchmarks are junk. Almost all cases of “I’ve created this benchmark myself” are likely to be junk. The prevalence of new frameworks overly focusing on nebulous benchmarking claims is generally junk. An obsession on benchmarking numbers can also sometimes result in poor overall design choices, such as obfuscated or unnecessarily coupled bits of codebase, because some not-very-meaningful metric is being prioritised over the code design itself. None of this should be contentious.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>always</em> true, for example, when Sanic was introduced there was a genuine step forward which was worth talking about, so I can understand why there was a focus there. But there’s still a ridiculous hype-cycle attached as a result, and we need to be really careful about trying to step beyond that.</p>

<p>It’s also reasonable if benchmarking is discussed in a sensible context and placement. For example, to the extent that Uvicorn and Starlette have discussed performance it has only ever been with a view to making a solid case that having a <em>properly specified</em> server/framework boundary API isn’t a negative performance consideration. Prior to the introduction of ASGI, Python’s async web ecosystem had generally bundled together both the low-level HTTP handling and the high level framework, and there was a notion that needed dispelling that introducing a properly specified separation of concerns wasn’t a good approach because <em>“something something performance something”</em>.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> going to look at web framework benchmarks for some very rough first-pass ideas about relative efficiency then the TechEmpower benchmarks should almost certainly be your baseline, since they’re at least independent, and have a decent range of test cases. If you’re going to diverge from them have some good argument for doing so.</p>

<p>The “Async Python is not faster” benchmarking is a reasonable example here, since it had clearly applied a decent degree of thoughtfulness. Even so there were still problems with the methodology, as <a href="https://twitter.com/llanga/status/1271719778324025349">Łukasz Langa did a good job of unpicking</a>.</p>

<p>Having said that, the TechEmpower benchmarks only show throughput, and don’t include any <em>meaningful</em> latency information. There’s actually a good reason for that, since
comparing latencies is really difficult. You can’t arrive at a single “95% latency” figure, because the figure you’ll arrive at <em>also depends on what throughput load you’re putting the system under</em> at the time of measuring the latency.</p>

<p>As a result measuring latency is only ever really meaningful if you’re looking at <em>graphs of how the latencies vary over a range of different throughputs</em>. Amber Brown’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxP1I-tm_2c">DjangoCon 2019 keynote talk does a fantastic job of showing some examples here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-asgi-is-a-really-positive-step-for-the-async-ecosystem">★ ASGI is a really positive step for the async ecosystem.</h3>

<p>Having a decently specified server/framework interface is a <em>really good thing</em>. Andrew Godwin’s design for ASGI fills this gap with a WSGI-like approach. That has a set of trade-offs, but it’s a pretty pragmatic and well rounded choice.</p>

<p>This should not really be contentious.</p>

<h3 id="-its-about-functionality">★ It’s about functionality.</h3>

<p>Async isn’t just about achieving higher levels of concurrency-per-server, it also makes it a bunch of new functionality more feasible, including…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling long-lived network connections like Websockets.</li>
  <li>Long-lived HTTP connections and server sent events.</li>
  <li>Dealing with background tasks without necessarily needing a full blown task queue subcomponent.</li>
  <li>Parallelizing outgoing HTTP requests or other high latency I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-not-everything-is-perfect">★ Not everything is perfect.</h3>

<p>The async ecosystem is far more immature than the existing thread synchronous. There are different challenges there, such as ensuring that <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">backpressure is handled consistently throughout the various async APIs</a>, or in <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">applying the lessons of structured concurrency</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the “stdlib asyncio isn’t perfect” line a good argument either against asyncio specifically, or against async/await in general.</p>

<p>It’s okay that there’s still work to do in places. We know.  Let’s get that work done.</p>

<h3 id="-async-is-harder">★ Async is harder.</h3>

<p>Having to <em>think</em> about if a function does or doesn’t make I/O or could otherwise block <em>is unarguably more complex than not having to think about it</em>. It’s also more precise - you’re having to think about that for a reason, and done properly it’s presenting you with more information as a result. Being able to reason more clearly about which parts of your framework stack do or don’t perform I/O has a cost but also brings benefits.</p>

<p>There’s an analogy to make there in that writing Python using explicitly enforced typing is likely to be a harder than writing Python in an untyped style. It’s harder because you’re <em>also being more precise</em>. That’s not necessarily either good or bad, but it is definitively <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>This also gets to the point about why the “<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What colour is your function</a>” argument isn’t actually a good case against async code, even if it seems to make clear sense on first pass. We’re coloring our functions because we’re <em>enforcing the exposure of some important information all the way throughout the stack</em>. That’s not an inherently bad thing to do.</p>

<hr>



<p>If those are areas where I think we ought to be able to reach consensus on, then there’s also a few areas where I think that the possible outcomes are less clear…</p>

<h3 id="-you-take-the-high-road-and-ill-take-the-low-road">★ You take the high road, and I’ll take the low road.</h3>

<p>There’s a few different tacks we might take onto introducing async into the Python web framework ecosystem…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promoting mostly staying with threaded web frameworks. There’s actually a perfectly decent case to make that Python <em>on the whole</em> should eschew a <em>wide move towards async</em>. That the drawbacks of moving large swathes of the ecosystem towards an async model outweigh the advantages. (Pros: Simpler for the end developer. Huge existing ecosystem.)</li>
  <li>Working towards blended approaches. This is being championed within the Django community which is incrementally adding async support, largely off the back of some Herculean work by Andrew Godwin and others. This approach can either be in the form of adding support for async at the server level, while keeping the framework level strictly thread-synchronous. Or it can gradually start to expose optional async capabilities all the way through the stack. (Pros: Brings along the existing ecosystem, while adding async capabilities when they’re needed.)</li>
  <li>Working towards async-native frameworks. (Pros: Lower overall complexity of the stack then blended approach. More efficient since there’s less overhead in marshalling between two style all the way through the stack. If we’re having to write large amounts of new code then it’s not a bad inflection point at which to also rethink and finesse other aspects of how we’re putting together new frameworks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t really say which of these will yield the best dividends. Personally I <em>happen</em> to be working in the last of those three slices, simply because I can see a bunch of areas where I can contribute meaningfully towards the ecosystem there.</p>

<h3 id="-positioning-asyncio-and-trio">★ Positioning asyncio and Trio</h3>

<p>There another big question mark over the relative positioning of asyncio and Trio in the ecosystem. Trio is a newer approach to a Python async framework, that’s meticulously designed, and based on the principles of structured concurrency, that have been outlined by it’s author, Nathaniel Smith.</p>

<p>The difficulty this brings is that Trio is necessarily incompatible with asyncio, and introduces an ecosystem-split within an ecosystem-split.</p>

<p>There’s a few different …</p></div></div>

<p>This a breathtakingly brief summary of <a href="https://amzn.to/3eLsN5D">Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction</a> by Chris Sims &amp; Hillary Louise Johnson.</p>



<h2>Definition</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Scrum</strong> is a simple framework for small teams to develop complex products.</li><li>The principle of scrum is <strong>inspect and adapt</strong>, or continuous improvement.</li><li>A <strong>scrum team</strong> consists of 5–9 people.</li><li>A scrum team moves in short cycles of time called <strong>sprints</strong>.</li></ul>



<blockquote><p>Experience is the best teacher, and the scrum cycle is designed to provide you with multiple opportunities to receive feedback—from customers, from the team, from the market—and to learn from it.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Roles</h2>



<h3>Product Owner</h3>



<ul><li>Represents the interests of the business and customers.</li><li>Has a hold on the product vision.</li><li>Directs the team towards the most important work.</li><li>Prioritizes, orders, and discusses product backlog requirements and criteria with the team.</li><li>Responsible for creating <strong>user stories</strong> to capture requirements, in the form of “As a <code>&lt;role&gt;</code>, I want <code>&lt;a feature&gt;</code>, so that I can <code>&lt;accomplish something&gt;</code>“.</li></ul>



<h3>Scrum Master</h3>



<ul><li>Advisor to the product owner and team.</li><li>Focuses on improving the team in order to increase the deliverables.</li><li>Not a boss but a helper and scrum expert.</li></ul>



<h3>Team Member</h3>



<ul><li>Has technical or domain skills required to create or contribute to a product.</li><li>Has authority to decide how the work should be done.</li><li>Creates estimates on items, user stories, tasks, etc.</li><li>Helps the team deliver value each sprint.</li></ul>



<h2>Artifacts</h2>



<h3>Product Backlog</h3>



<ul><li>Contains a list of product deliverables that represent:<ul><li>Features</li><li>Bug Fixes</li><li>Documentation</li><li>Meaningful or Valuable Things</li></ul></li><li>Deliverables are known as <strong>items</strong>, and captured in the form of user stories.</li><li>The user stories are ordered from most to least important in the backlog.</li><li>User stories at the top should be well understood while user stories at the bottom can be revisited in the future for refinement or grooming.</li><li>Good user stories should answer the following questions:<ol start=""><li><strong>Who is it for?</strong></li><li><strong>What needs to be built?</strong></li><li><strong>Why should we do it?</strong></li><li><strong>How long will it take?</strong></li><li><strong>What are the acceptance criteria?</strong></li></ol></li></ul>



<h3>Sprint Backlog</h3>



<ul><li>Contains a list of sprint deliverables.</li><li>The items in the sprint backlog have a limited timespan: the length of the sprint.</li><li>Represents the commitment of the team to produce deliverables.</li><li>User stories are broken down into tasks, or bits of work required to complete a story.</li><li><strong>User stories are units of value while tasks are units of work.</strong></li></ul>



<h3>Burn Charts</h3>



<ul><li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart">chart</a> for visualizing the relationship between time and scope.</li><li>Time is plotted on the X-axis (horizontal) while scope is on the Y-axis (vertical).</li><li>Tracks how much work a team has completed over time.</li><li>The scope of the work can be measured in points and the unit of time can be measured in sprints.</li><li>The chart moves upward when new work is introduced, and downward as the work is completed.</li></ul>



<h3>Task Board</h3>



<ul><li>A tool for visualizing work for team members and stakeholders.</li><li>The simplest task board consists of three columns:<ol start=""><li><strong>To Do</strong></li><li><strong>Doing</strong></li><li><strong>Done</strong></li></ol></li><li>Tasks move across columns, giving the team visibility on their situation and allowing them to inspect and adapt.</li></ul>



<h3>Definition of Done</h3>



<ul><li>Different members of the team might have different meanings for what “done” means.</li><li>Good scrum teams create their own definition of “done”.</li><li>The list of things the team does before declaring a user story as done becomes their definition.</li></ul>



<h2>The Sprint Cycle</h2>



<p>The sprint cycle is the essential rhythm of scrum. It’s the period of time where work gets done, continually. <strong>It consists of five team meetings that fuel the inspect-and-adapt cycle of scrum.</strong></p>



<p>The cycle can be as short as one week or as long as one month or more.</p>



<h3>Sprint Planning</h3>



<p><strong>Duration: one to two hours.</strong></p>



<ul><li>The beginning of the sprint.</li><li>The planning is divided into two parts:<ol start=""><li><strong>What will we do?</strong><ul><li>The team settles on a set of user stories that it can deliver by the end of the sprint: the sprint backlog.</li><li>The product owner presents the user stories to the team for discussion, review, and acceptance into the sprint.</li><li>The product owner decides which user stories will be considered; the team members decide how much work they can perform during the sprint.</li></ul></li><li><strong>How will we do it?</strong><ul><li>The team breaks down the accepted user stories into tasks.</li><li>The team can adjust the number of user stories at this stage if the work becomes too large for the sprint.</li><li>The product owner provides guidance, support, and answers questions until the stories become clear and broken down into tasks.</li></ul></li></ol></li></ul>



<h3>Daily Scrum</h3>



<p><strong>Duration: less than fifteen minutes.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Usually called the stand-up meeting, as members physically stand up for the meeting.</li><li>It is conducted daily, typically at the start of the work day.</li><li>It is brief and to the point.</li><li>Team members share the following:<ol start=""><li><strong>What tasks I’ve completed since the last daily scrum.</strong></li><li><strong>What tasks I expect to complete by the next daily scrum.</strong></li><li><strong>What obstacles are slowing me down.</strong></li></ol></li><li>The goal of the meeting is for the team to inspect and adapt its own work in order to deliver the stories at the end of the sprint.</li><li>Issues or problems that surface during the meeting don’t need to be solved during the meeting, they can be addressed afterwards.</li></ul>



<h3>Story Time</h3>



<p><strong>Duration: one to two hours, every week.</strong></p>



<ul><li>A time for discussing and improving the user stories in the product backlog for future sprints.</li><li>Also known as refinement or grooming.</li><li>The team works together to answer the questions for writing good user stories, focusing on defining the acceptance criteria.</li><li>During this meeting the team will size or estimate the user stories. These can be points or other metrics preferred by the team.</li></ul>



<h3>Sprint Review</h3>



<p><strong>Duration: one-half to one hour for every week of development.</strong></p>



<ul><li>The end of the sprint.</li><li>The team shows off its accomplishments and highlights the stories that are considered done.</li><li>Stakeholders can be invited to the meeting.</li><li>Feedback is gathered from the team and stakeholders.</li></ul>



<h3>Retrospective</h3>



<p><strong>Duration: one to two hours for every week of development.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Time for the team to reflect on what was learned during the sprint and opportunities for improvement.</li><li>It’s not about finding what went well or wrong, but about making strategic changes for the next sprint.</li><li>The meeting should be focused on improving the process.</li><li>The retrospective should be conducted in cases of abnormal sprint termination.</li></ul>



<blockquote><p>In scrum, the basic agreement between management and the team is that management won’t change up requirements during a sprint.</p></blockquote>

        <p>In this post we'll take a look under the covers at what happens we look up hosts.</p>
<p>If you're here, you'll have an idea that the answer is basically "DNS" - but 
that's not the whole story. Let's make things concrete; we're going to answer 
the question: how does the following snippet of (pseudo-)code figure out what 
host to connect to?</p>
<pre><span>conn = </span><span>socket::connect</span><span>("</span><span>www.jameselford.com</span><span>", </span><span>443</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>DNS is just one part of the answer.</p>
<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p><em>Most</em> programs on a normal linux system will look in <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> to
figure out how to resolve hostnames. But lots of programs won't. Pretty
much everything will find your DNS servers in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. Generally,
this process will involve a call to <code>getaddrinfo</code>, provided by your system's 
standard C library.</p>
<p>If that's what you came to find out, then you can go back to the internet now;
thanks for your time. Stick around if you want to get into altogether too much
detail about how this all happens.</p>
<h2>what's coming up</h2>
<p>We'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>How our program ends up calling into <code>libc</code> (by diving into the source)</li>
<li>How <code>libc</code> resolves our hostname (with a little help from <code>strace</code>)</li>
<li>and along the way, some opportunities to tweak how our system does host lookup</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start in Rust land, because that's kind of my jam, but
you could do a similar journey for any high-level programming language. Maybe
you hate jam. Maybe you're more of a Python / marmalade / Ruby sort of person.
That's fine too; ultimately it doesn't matter how you do it, so long as there's
a thick layer of sugar on your breakfast. In C, you'd just skip the first step 
and go straight to <code>libc</code>. I guess in this analogy, C is the toast.</p>
<h2>check the source - peeking into the (Rust) standard library</h2>
<p>In Rust, the pseudo-code above looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> c = TcpStream::connect("</span><span>www.jameselford.com:443</span><span>");
</span></pre>
<p>... so <code>TcpStream::connect</code> is our jumping-off point. <code>connect</code> takes any
argument with a corresponding <code>ToSocketAddrs</code> implementation - and the 
standard library comes with implementors for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/trait.ToSocketAddrs.html#implementors">a whole range of sensible types</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/net/addr.rs.html#969-979">Here's</a> the
implementation for <code>str</code>:</p>
<pre><span>// accepts strings like 'localhost:12345'
</span><span>#[</span><span>stable</span><span>(feature = "</span><span>rust1</span><span>", since = "</span><span>1.0.0</span><span>")]
</span><span>impl </span><span>ToSocketAddrs </span><span>for </span><span>str {
    </span><span>type </span><span>Iter = vec::IntoIter&lt;SocketAddr&gt;;
    </span><span>fn </span><span>to_socket_addrs</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; io::Result&lt;vec::IntoIter&lt;SocketAddr&gt;&gt; {
        </span><span>// try to parse as a regular SocketAddr first
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(addr) = </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>() {
            </span><span>return </span><span>Ok(vec![addr].</span><span>into_iter</span><span>());
        }

        </span><span>resolve_socket_addr</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>try_into</span><span>()?)
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>The call to <code>parse</code> near the top brings some extra conversion magic into the mix,
but all that's doing is leaning on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/net/parser.rs.html#318-326"><code>SocketAddr</code>'s <code>FromStr</code> implementation</a>,
which I won't list here, because it's just dealing with the case that the <code>str</code>
is already a straightforward <code>SocketAddr</code> (e.g. <code>192.168.1.1:80</code>). That's not 
our case.</p>
<p>Next comes <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/net/addr.rs.html#936"><code>resolve_socket_addr</code></a>.
"Resolve" - that's a familiar word from the world of DNS; sounds like it could 
be what we're looking for. Let's dig in:</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>resolve_socket_addr</span><span>(</span><span>lh</span><span>: LookupHost) -&gt; io::Result&lt;vec::IntoIter&lt;SocketAddr&gt;&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> p = lh.</span><span>port</span><span>();
    </span><span>let</span><span> v: Vec&lt;_&gt; = lh
        .</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>mut </span><span>a</span><span>| {
            a.</span><span>set_port</span><span>(p);
            a
        })
        .</span><span>collect</span><span>();
    Ok(v.</span><span>into_iter</span><span>())
}
</span></pre>
<p>Uh... huh... looks like a simple transform of the <code>lh</code> input argument
into the result. Also, I can't help noticing, this function returns a <code>Result</code>
(which is what we expect! ... we're looking for something that can reach out
and hit remote DNS servers, over the network after all), but this function is
infallible: it can only return <code>Ok(...)</code> at the end.</p>
<p>Just one thing: our <code>str</code> has become <code>lh: LookupHost</code>, and it appears to have all
the answers. Where did that come from? Let's back up to our <code>to_socket_addrs</code>
function - notice the last line:</p>
<pre><span>resolve_socket_addr</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>try_into</span><span>()?)
</span></pre>
<p>That <code>try_into</code> is where the magic's happening. The name <code>try_...</code> and the 
<code>Result</code> return type (indicated by the <code>?</code>) are good hints that <em>something's</em>
going on here. On first pass, I assumed it was "just" a straightforward
conversion into another more convenient type for the lookup, but in fact,
<code>try_into</code> <em>is</em> the lookup, as we'll see. Let's skip over to the
implementation... but... how exactly do we find that? No mention of <code>LookupHost</code>
on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html?search=lookuphost">doc.rust-lang.org's normally trusty search</a>.</p>
<h2>further into the source - standard library internals</h2>
<p>So we need to look deeper than what's publicly exposed by the standard
library, into the implementation details. </p>
<p>This is good news: it means we're getting to the heart of it.
"Where do host names come from?" is exactly the sort of thing that we want
the standard library to take care of for us, so we knew we'd have to look
behind the curtain at some point.</p>
<p>Okay, enough narrative, let's see some code. </p>
<p>We'll shift over to the Rust sources: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/sys_common/net.rs#L163">here's</a>
the <code>TryFrom</code> implementation for <code>LookupHost</code> we were after (this allows us to
use <code>try_into</code> to <code>to_socket_addrs</code> above). We'll skip over that as it just splits 
the <code>str</code> up into a <code>(host, port)</code> pair, and calls <code>try_into()</code> again, which is
defined immediately below in the same file:</p>
<pre><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; TryFrom&lt;(&amp;</span><span>'a str</span><span>, </span><span>u16</span><span>)&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>LookupHost {
    </span><span>type </span><span>Error = io::Error;

    </span><span>fn </span><span>try_from</span><span>((</span><span>host</span><span>, </span><span>port</span><span>): (&amp;</span><span>'a str</span><span>, </span><span>u16</span><span>)) -&gt; io::Result&lt;LookupHost&gt; {
        </span><span>init</span><span>();

        </span><span>let c_host </span><span>= CString::new(host)?;
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> hints: c::addrinfo = </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ mem::zeroed() };
        hints.ai_socktype = c::</span><span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>;
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> res = ptr::null_mut();
        </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{
            </span><span>cvt_gai</span><span>(c::getaddrinfo(</span><span>c_host</span><span>.</span><span>as_ptr</span><span>(), ptr::null(), &amp;hints, &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> res))
                .</span><span>map</span><span>(|_| LookupHost { original: res, cur: res, port })
        }
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>Ah hah! Unsafe code! With a strong whiff of FFI about it! We're getting to the
good stuff now. That call to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getaddrinfo"><code>getaddrinfo</code></a>
is the final step that takes us into the <code>libc</code> - which is, ultimately, where 
the sausage gets made. </p>
<p>There is one more hop here:</p>
<pre><span>c::getaddrinfo(...)
</span></pre>
<p>It's natural to read that as "call <code>getaddrinfo</code> from a C library", but <code>c</code> is
just a Rust namespace like any other, so this function is being imported from
somewhere. Scroll up to the top, and you'll see it comes from:</p>
<pre><span>use crate</span><span>::sys::net::netc as c;
</span></pre>
<p><code>sys</code> is where the Rust standard library keeps its platform-specific code, so
the implementation will depend on the current platform. On <em>unix</em> platforms,
<code>sys::net::netc</code> is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/sys/unix/net.rs#L17">defined as</a> backing on to <code>libc</code>:</p>
<pre><span>pub extern crate</span><span> libc as netc;
</span></pre>
<p>... but that needn't be the case everywhere - for example on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/sys/wasi/net.rs#L376">wasi platform</a>
<code>netc</code> is defined as a native Rust module, with no <code>libc</code> in sight. </p>
<p>Okay, that's enough technicalities: for our purposes, this <code>c::getaddrinfo</code> is
a call through to <code>libc</code>.</p>
<h2>quick asside on FFI and <code>libc</code></h2>
<p>FFI is short for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html?highlight=ffi#using-extern-functions-to-call-external-code">"foreign function interface"</a>. 
Rust leans on existing libraries C for a whole bunch of functionality, and in 
this case, for functionality built into <code>libc</code>. When languages call into other
languages that exist outside their own ecosystem (in this case, Rust to C), 
that's FFI.</p>
<p><code>libc</code> is a widely-scoped C library that's provided as part of POSIX. It
handles all sorts of common functionality - hostname resolution is one area,
but in fact Rust delegates to <code>libc</code> for pretty much anything that touches the 
network, opens files, spawns new processes, ... in short: anything that 
requires making System Calls. Rust isn't alone in leaning on a <code>libc</code> for 
this; most programming languages eventually call through to <code>libc</code> (Python, 
Ruby, and Java all do, for example). That's good news; from this point on, what
we learn translates well across languages. Go is a notable exception here - 
but more on that later.</p>
<p>POSIX only specifies the <em>interface</em> that <code>libc</code> has to provide, and
there are several implementations. On Linux, the most common implementation of
<code>libc</code> is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/"><code>glibc</code></a>, so that's what we'll 
talk about next, but others do exist. Again, more on that later.</p>
<h2>rephrasing the question</h2>
<p>Now that we've established that we call through to <code>libc</code>'s <code>getaddrinfo</code>, and
that <code>libc</code> is commonly implemented by <code>glibc</code>, we can rephrase the question as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how does <code>glibc</code> implement <code>getaddrinfo</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we dig into that, let's take stock. We've arrived at the conclusion that
we call through to the commonly used <code>libc</code>. We've said that pretty much every
language does the same thing. That means that the answers we're looking for 
will be applicable pretty much everywhere, including in C programs. There's
going to be some prior art on this.</p>
<h2>what does the internet say?</h2>
<p>What do we know already about how our programs find hosts?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Eventually</em> we know that we'll connect to a DNS server and make a request</li>
<li>We probably know that at some stage the <code>hosts</code> file comes into it</li>
<li>We know that DNS configuration is system-wide. When we connect to a network,
our computers automatically figure out what DNS to use (or we configure it
ourselves).</li>
<li>Maybe some caching?!</li>
<li><code>localhost</code> is always the loopback interface - presumably we don't ask the
DNS servers for that?</li>
<li>There's something special about the <code>.local</code> domain?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start with the global configuration of DNS servers. If we search for
"dns linux" we get a few interesting hits:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's <a href="https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/changing-dns-settings-on-linux/">this article</a>
pointing us to <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a>,
which contains DNS configuration.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Domain_name_resolution#Overwriting_of_/etc/resolv.conf">Arch Wiki entry on domain name resolution</a>
tells us that <code>resolv.conf</code> is generally overwritten by network managers like
GNOME's aptly-named <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a>.
That's re-assuring, as it joins the dots from the familiar configuration 
options we get when we go to our environment's Network Settings screen, to 
something that <code>libc</code> and friends can find.</li>
<li>The same page also tells us that <code>glibc</code>'s implementation of <code>getaddrinfo</code> is
backed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch"><code>NSS</code></a>, which
reads from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html">nsswitch.conf</a>. Hopefully we'll be able to see where that happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's have a look in those files and see what we can see. Here's the contents
of my <code>resolv.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><span>j@.. ~/s/dns-experiment&gt; cat /etc/resolv.conf 
# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 192.168.1.2
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
</span></pre>
<p>It checks out:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>192.168.1.2</code> is the address of my local DNS resolver (a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">pihole</a>,
if you're interested)</li>
<li><code>8.8.8.8</code> and <code>8.8.4.4</code> are Google's public DNS, …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Proper way to create folder structure for your Django Project.</p><div><p>In this blog post you’ll learn how to create best folder structure for your Django project. Django folder structure is consist of project root and apps. If you are not creating the right folder structure then everything will look complex.</p><p>This guide is for starting the project from scratch. For an established project, please keep this idea in mind and try to add these methods one by one.</p><h2 id="create-a-project">Create a project</h2><p>Creating the project is very easy in Django; It’s just the <code>startproject</code> command, and it will create a few files and folders in your project. Let’s see what those are…</p><pre><code>python manage.py startproject projdir
</code></pre><p>Now the project tree will look like this.</p><pre><code>├── manage.py
└── projdir
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── asgi.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
</code></pre><p>Now we’ve created the Django project, and now we have two options to proceed. One is to create the apps next to projdir or create an app inside the project folder and will continue developing from it.</p><p><strong>Two Methods</strong></p><ol><li>Create apps after the project folder</li><li>Create apps inside the project folder.</li></ol><p>I like the second approach better because that will gives a clean look into the overall project. It’s very easy and will look like everything seems organised. So let’s create the apps for our project.</p><h2 id="create-apps">Create apps</h2><p>For the second approach we need to create the folder by hand then run the <code>startapp</code> command. This way we can avoid the command error that cause by folder not present in the first place.</p><pre><code>cd projdir
mkdir app1
cd ..
python manage.py startapp core projdir/core
</code></pre><p>Now that we have created the folder structure lets see how the tree structure look like.</p><pre><code>├── manage.py
└── projdir
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── app1
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── admin.py
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── apps.py
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── migrations
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── __init__.py
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── models.py
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── tests.py
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── views.py
    ├── asgi.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
</code></pre><p>Apps created by the <code>startapp</code> command will have all the necessary files for the Django app. Now how do we point this to installed apps.</p><h2 id="installed-apps">Installed apps</h2><p>We must tell the Django that our newly created apps dotted path. Then only Django will recognise our app as Django apps otherwise you can’t run migrations and other benefits. Okay let’s see how we can add dotted path in installed apps.</p><p>There is two approach in there one is using the dotted path upto the apps directory or the AppConfig directory.</p><ol><li>Dotted path from root project folder to apps.</li><li>Dotted path from root project folder to AppConfig.</li></ol><p>I can just use the first approach but Django recently pushing developers to use AppConfig much. I say first one is pretty easy to mention. In our case it will be <code>projdir.app1</code></p><p>But the second approach is bit different you need to change the apps.py file <code>name</code> variable then only Django will consider the AppConfig dotted path as valid.</p><pre><code>class App2Config(AppConfig):
    name = "prouder.app2"
</code></pre><p>And in the installed app just mention the path upto AppConfig like this…</p><pre><code>projdir.app2.apps.App2Config
</code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So far, we have seen how to create a folder structure in Django, both normally like and inside the root project folder to avoid the mess.</p><p>You can find all the code in<a href="https://github.com/rajasimon/django-project-structure">github/django-project-structure</a> repository.</p></div><p>This article published under

<p>Yet on macroscopic scales, sound is described as having a <i>frequency distribution as a function of time</i>, i.e., a note has both a pitch and a duration.  There are many formalisms for describing this (e.g., wavelets), but a well-known limitation is that the frequency <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7ecb2edca0c056ef63841faa6b190da7_l3.png" alt="\omega" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="7" width="9"> of a note is only well-defined up to an uncertainty that is inversely proportional to its duration <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ae18682396bda8e5637579f4d951d33b_l3.png" alt="\Delta t" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="10" width="17">.</p>
<p>At the mathematical level, a given wavefunction <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-78738c93898c21533aebe69aa432b309_l3.png" alt="\psi(x)" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="29"> is almost exactly analogous: macroscopically a particle seems to have a well-defined position and momentum, but microscopically there is only the wavefunction <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-2b42539d45e74b745aa9c4fc6ac8a8cb_l3.png" alt="\psi" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="14" width="10">.  The mapping of the analogy<a href="#footnote-7" id="refmark-7"><sup killerfootnote=""><b><big>a  </big></b></sup></a> is <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ee14f3c67bc4b3632f070dfa96da4253_l3.png" alt="\{t,\omega,f\} \to \{x,p,\psi\}" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="125">.  Wavefunctions can of course be complex, but we can restrict ourself to a real-valued wavefunction without any trouble; we are not worrying about the dynamics of wavefunctions, so you can pretend the Hamiltonian vanishes if you like.</p>
<p>In order to get the acoustic analog of Planck’s constant <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-36a782e50141956888851adf27e9940c_l3.png" alt="\hbar" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="11" width="8">, it helps to imagine going back to a time when the pitch of a note was measured with a unit that did not have a known connection to absolute frequency, i.e., to inverse-time units.  To my (very limited) understanding, by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning">6th century BC</a> it was already understood that an octave was the difference between two notes when one is vibrating twice as fast as another, but the absolute frequency (oscillations per second) of any particular note — say C♯ — was not known.<a href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup killerfootnote=""><b><big>b  </big></b></sup></a>  Let’s arbitrarily declare <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-dad1f7b998c838a96548f8dcbabac2c1_l3.png" alt="\Delta v" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="11" width="19"> to be the interval between pitches C♯ and C in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)">one-lined octave</a>.  Today we know that C♯ and C correspond to 277.18 and 261.63 Hz, respectively, so that <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-55f8ac9560392f69f75170e6fd902d68_l3.png" alt="1/\Delta v" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="32"> corresponds to 64.31 ms <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6544421992cadf090e36ffd87c11e0f5_l3.png" alt="\equiv 1/\Delta C" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="53">, but in the distant past for humanity (or the very recent past for me), this was unknown.</p>
<p>If I listened very carefully, or at least if I built special equipment, I would find that the purity of a note’s pitch begins to degrade as the duration of the note approaches its inverse frequency; this would be a hint about the location of the acoustic microscopic scale <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bc1cabad1300905dcd7fe741d7654312_l3.png" alt="a \equiv \Delta v /\Delta C" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="78">.  That is, I would find it harder and harder to distinguish between the notes C♯ and C as the duration of the notes approached of order 60 ms (although it might happen with even longer durations due to imperfections of my ears/equipment).  To confidently establish the relationship between perceived pitch and inverse time, I would probably want to listen to sound made by objects whose frequency of vibration I could measure directly.  That would be easy today, but very difficult three thousand years ago.</p>
<p>The analog of <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-36a782e50141956888851adf27e9940c_l3.png" alt="\hbar" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="11" width="8">, then, would be the ratio <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ba57c79e062ede81b8328e039f685d21_l3.png" alt="a = \Delta v /\Delta C" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="78">.  Whenever someone says “middle C is 261.63 Hz”, they are effectively setting <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-23536ee4051b9db71bed93260d8a4493_l3.png" alt="a=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="10" width="34"> (i.e., measuring pitch in units of inverse-time), just as physicists commonly set <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-dcdc31084fcc1912383006fa8778e3ad_l3.png" alt="\hbar=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="34"> (measuring momentum in units of inverse-distance).  But crucially, for understanding the history of science, this is not possible until you have equipment that is sensitive to the microscopic scale.  Before this, you needed two separate systems of units that could not (then) be connected in a principled manner.</p>
<p>The quantum-acoustic analogy is not just conceptual, it is a mathematically precise correspondence, to the point that there are book-length treatments that apply almost equally well to both.<a href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup killerfootnote=""><b><big>c  </big></b></sup></a>  In particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_quasiprobability_distribution">Wigner function</a> (previous posts: <a href="https://blog.jessriedel.com/2014/04/01/wigner-function-fourier-transform-coordinate-rotation/">1</a>,<a href="https://blog.jessriedel.com/2014/09/22/in-what-sense-is-the-wigner-function-a-quasiprobability-distribution/">2</a>) for simultaneously representing the position and momentum of a particle can be used fruitfully in acoustics for simultaneously representing the duration and pitch of sounds (which is <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c98a/050c262874c81e21d00107f061c8b2737278.pdf">closely related</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform">short-time Fourier transform</a>).  And, importantly, it is true for both quantum mechanics and acoustics that the macroscopic limit (<img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ca7b9ae225c27443889e3385f880ca97_l3.png" alt="\hbar,a\to 0" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="52">) is “singular”:  Just as only a few <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-36a782e50141956888851adf27e9940c_l3.png" alt="\hbar" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="11" width="8">-indexed families of quantum states have a sensible classical limit, only a few <img src="https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-653334e90ed20a9c5552098b53066d35_l3.png" alt="a" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="7" width="8">-indexed families of acoustic waveforms have a sensible decomposition into notes (“music”).  When this limit fails, it’s not a case of bad music, it’s a case of your speakers blowing out.</p>
<p>What makes quantum mechanics “mysterious” then is clearly not things like the form of the uncertainty principle per se.  (There is an acoustic uncertainty principle of identical mathematical form.)  Rather, it is the interpretation of the wavefunction in terms of probability amplitudes and our inability to probe it except indirectly through disturbing measurements, as opposed to acoustic waves which can be measured to arbitrary precision.<a href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup killerfootnote=""><b><big>d  </big></b></sup></a>  Relatedly, there is, to my understanding, no acoustic analog of a mixed quantum state.</p>
<p>Basic harmonic analysis of acoustics is an interesting topic in elementary physics in its own right.  Maybe teaching more of it (especially in a phase-space formulation using a Wigner function) before presenting quantum mechanics would help students more easily see what’s truly unusual about quantum mechanics and what’s just an unfamiliar mathematical framework.</p>

<p>For those of you in a hurry: I made a version of the classic Pong game using Go and WebAssembly. I then embedded that game on my website. Warning: it <strong>works only on desktop now (no handling of touch)</strong>. Here is the game, enjoy:</p>


    





<p>WebAssembly is a relatively new standard on web browsers. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high-performance applications on web pages, but the format is designed to be executed and integrated in other environments as well. (…) WebAssembly (i.e. WebAssembly Core Specification and WebAssembly JavaScript Interface) became World Wide Web Consortium recommendations on 5 December 2019 and, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is the fourth language to run natively in browsers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it can be used on other interfaces, the WebAssembly standard basically allows to run code written in another language than HTML or JavaScript, so long as it can be compiled into WebAssembly language, which can be seen as the equivalent as assembly code for any JavaScript virtual machine, but in particular web browsers. The output <em>.wasm</em> file of any WebAssembly project can be read and interpreted directly by any web browser following the WWW spec. The project was kicked off and first maintained by the Mozilla foundation. The documentation can be found on the <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>



<p>At <a href="https://en.getmoona.com/" target="_blank">Moona</a>, our backend API server runs on go. I really like this language as it is simple to write, yet feature-rich and performant, with a large community and adoption by tech companies working on large-scale infrastructure and systems (Google, Amazon, Netflix, Docker, Cloudflare…). There should always be one “canonic” way to do one thing, which makes reasoning about code easier, freeing up some mental load. It’s a compiled, statically-typed language so it catches more potential errors upstream, it’s garbage-collected so no need to manage memory, it handles concurrency natively and it’s fast.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank">Pong</a> is a classic game made popular by Atari systems, and was one of the first home video games ever commercialized. I wanted to try out WebAssembly with Go on a simple and classic game which can be played against an AI or another human to make it more fun.</p>



<p>At first I had written this game using the <a href="https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2" target="_blank">Go port of the SDL2 library</a>, originally written in C, which allows to access audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D, in order to code native user interfaces (including games) easily. Credit goes to <a href="https://github.com/jackmott" target="_blank">Jack Mott</a> for his tutorial series <a href="https://gameswithgo.org/" target="_blank">Games with Go</a> for the initial version, which was inspired from his videos and modified to fit my needs.</p>

<p>But while porting the game to WebAssembly, I looked for ways to simplify development. So I found this 2D gaming library named <a href="https://ebiten.org/" target="_blank">Ebiten</a> by <a href="https://github.com/hajimehoshi" target="_blank">Hajime Hoshi</a> which was perfectly suited for the job, as it handles game loop, 60FPS graphics, inputs, text, audio, sprites etc. and can compile to WebAssembly (!!!). I refactored the code to fit the new library.</p>

<p>The code is organized into:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>package pong</code> which contains all the game objects and structures (paddles, ball, text, colors, enums), as well as logic specific to these objects. The two paddles and the ball can be <code>Update</code>d and <code>Draw</code>n on the screen.</li>
<li><code>package main</code> which contains the game loop and logic dependent on the game states</li>
<li><code>package server</code> which is a super simple HTTP server for the WebAssembly version</li>
</ul>

<p>The game has several states which are simple and grouped into a go struct as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// there can be only up to 256 game states ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
type GameState byte

const (
	StartState GameState = iota
	ControlsState
	PlayState
	InterState
	PauseState
	GameOverState
)
</code></pre>

<p>The game logic is pretty straightforward. There are still some small glitches but overall it’s an easy piece of code, just for demo purposes. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/dstoiko/go-pong-wasm" target="_blank">on my github here</a>.</p>



<p>I first ran the code in a native binary executable, because the compilation was straightforward and it allowed me to test the game logic easily on my machine. I created a <em>Makefile</em> with the target <code>native</code> which should perform the simple command:</p>

<pre><code>go build -o ./build/pong .

<p>Then, I wanted to port the code to WebAssembly. But first I needed to figure out a few things…</p>

<h2 id="how-to-compile-the-go-code-to-output-a-wasm-webassembly-file">How to compile the go code to output a <em>.wasm</em> WebAssembly file?</h2>

<p>Fortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started" target="_blank">Golang wiki</a> has an entry on how to build programs for WebAssembly. It goes straight to the point with a “hello world” example and simple steps to achieve a port of any program to WebAssembly. I recommend this resource as a must-read for anyone wanting to compile go code into WebAssembly. So I tested their example code and it seemed to work, so I started checking the documentation for it on the <a href="https://ebiten.org/documents/webassembly.html" target="_blank">Ebiten website</a>. So I created the <code>wasm</code> target in my <em>Makefile</em> which basically does this:</p>

<pre><code>cp $$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js ./html/wasm_exec.js
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ./html/main.wasm .
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>wasm_exec.js</em> file is a JavaScript support file which enables the use of system calls to the JS engine in the web browser.</p>

<p>I also adapted the main code so that it runs at fullscreen instead of fixed window size when running in a browser:</p>

<pre><code>func main() {
	if runtime.GOARCH == "js" || runtime.GOOS == "js" {
		ebiten.SetFullscreen(true)
	}
	...
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-and-what-exactly-to-serve-to-the-web-browser-in-order-to-properly-run-the-game">How (and what exactly) to serve to the web browser in order to properly run the game?</h2>

<p>We need to serve three files ultimately:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>main.wasm</em> file with WebAssembly compiled code</li>
<li>The <em>wasm_exec.js</em> JavaScript support file</li>

<li><p>The <em>index.html</em> which just streams the WebAssembly file into the browser with a simple JS script:</p>

<pre><code>// Polyfill
if (!WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming) {
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming = async (resp, importObject) =&gt; {
    const source = await (await resp).arrayBuffer();
    return await WebAssembly.instantiate(source, importObject);
};
}

const go = new Go();
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), go.importObject).then(result =&gt; {
go.run(result.instance);
});
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>So the <em>server/server.go</em> file will do just that. Once we compile the <em>main.wasm</em> from our go code, it will be served at <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a> and we’re set.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-make-the-executable-lightweight-when-embedding-it-into-a-static-website">How to make the executable lightweight when embedding it into a static website?</h2>

<p>The main issue with “just” compiling to WebAssembly is that the executable was around 10MB in size:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r--@  1 vultur  staff       661 Jul 12 22:26 index.html
-rwxr-xr-x@  1 vultur  staff  10147815 Jul 12 22:53 main.wasm
-rw-r--r--@  1 vultur  staff     13077 Jul 12 22:53 wasm_exec.js
</code></pre>

<p>So I needed a way to make the file a bit lighter in order to serve it on my blog. Thankfully there is <code>gzip</code> for that. Before writing any code or going deep into documentation, I checked out the examples on the Ebiten website, as the author was already embedding his demos on his website. I dug through the source code and found out that he’s using the <a href="https://github.com/nodeca/pako" target="_blank">pako JS library</a> to inflate the gzip-compressed files when streaming them in the browser. So I decided to do the same and:</p>

<p>…first, gzip the <em>main.wasm</em> file:</p>

<pre><code>gzip -9 -v -c main.wasm &gt; main.wasm.gz
</code></pre>

<p>…which gave me a file size of about 2MB:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r--@  1 vultur  staff   2296872 Jul 12 23:53 main.wasm.gz
</code></pre>

<p>…then, modify the <em>index.html</em> accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () =&gt; {
    const go = new Go();
    const url = "main.wasm.gz"; // the gzip-compressed wasm file
    const pako = window.pako;
    let wasm = pako.ungzip(await (await fetch(url)).arrayBuffer());
    // A fetched response might be decompressed twice on Firefox.
    // See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610679
    if (wasm[0] === 0x1f &amp;&amp; wasm[1] === 0x8b) {
        wasm = pako.ungzip(wasm);
    }
    const result = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm, go.importObject)
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
            console.error(err);
        });
    document.getElementById("loading").remove(); // a loading text before the wasm loads
    go.run(result.instance);
});
</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-to-embed-the-game-into-my-hugo-blog">How to embed the game into my Hugo blog?</h2>

<p>The last thing I needed to do was to embed the three files into my blog. I’m using the Hugo framework so all articles I write are in markdown. I created a <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/" target="_blank">custom shortcode</a> in order to embed the webassembly content as an iframe, as suggested by the Ebiten documentation. I first wrote a template for the shortcode, laying out the HTML that will be rendered when calling it from within the article:</p>

<pre><code>{{ if .Get "src" }}
    &lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;"&gt;
        &lt;iframe
            sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
            src="{{ .Get `src` }}"
            style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;"
        &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I just added the files for serving the game in a new page folder inside my blog directory and referenced to it as the <code>src</code> tag of my shortcode:</p>

<pre><code>{{ &lt; ebiten src="/pong/index.html" &gt; }}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="a-note-on-performance">A note on performance</h2>

<p>While the game is super smooth on native platforms and keeps its promise of 60FPS, I noticed on browsers that the framerate sometimes drops. At first I thought I was doing something wrong with the gaming library so I used the debug flag to build and check what drawing operations were done everytime the game loop ran. Also read the performance tips on the Ebiten website, but there was nothing I was doing that didn’t meet the performance guidelines. So I checked the examples on the website and noticed the same frame drops especially when maintaining a key pressed on the keyboard. It’s not a critical issue but needs to be investigated further… Maybe in another post when I get some time to debug!</p>



<p>In this little project, I learned how to build Go code into WebAssembly and learned how to program a game using the Ebiten library, which offers a range of great tools to develop any 2D game. It gave me a few ideas of things I want to try next with it. I hope you found this post interesting as an intro to WebAssembly!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4>(No, this isnâ€™t a political statement)</h4><h4>July 17th, 2020</h4></p><div><p>As a member of the hyped-up Gen Z, youâ€™d think Iâ€™d be an expert on TikTok. But no, I only downloaded it this week because I heard it might be taken down soon.</p>
<p>It turns out TikTok is kinda cool. Thatâ€™s not to say I think it should or shouldnâ€™t get banned, but itâ€™s easy to see the appeal after a week of using it. </p>
<p>And ironically, TikTok is a lot more democratic than a lot of other social networks.</p>

<p>Partly, because of the shared toolkit.</p>
<p>On Instagram, the 3rd party toolkit ranges from airbrush apps to After Effects.
On Youtube you have kids using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKfS5zVfGBc">unregistered HyperCam 2â€™s</a> pitted against aspiring Jake Paulâ€™s using Adobe Premiere.</p>
<p>But on TikTok, almost all videos are filmed on mobile devices and edited in the app itself. You canâ€™t assume much based on a thumbnail or the production quality of a clip.</p>
<p>This means I can put less effort + time into production quality and making sure my videos meet at a base standard. <strong>The friction from idea to delivered video is significantly less</strong> on TikTok vs. the other two platforms.</p>

<p>Then thereâ€™s the infinite scroll governed by <em>the algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Every major social network has one of these algorithms, and they all seem to be equally mysterious. Your entire future might be decided by a set of ever-changing ifâ€™s and elseâ€™s written in SV or Beijing.</p>
<p>And while most platforms use their feed algorithms to maximize engagement, TikTok uses it to maximize meme discovery.â€&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I compete against Addison Raeâ€™s profile? Probably not, but apparently you can sneak in a lot more dancing Chilean software engineers on my TikTok Feed than my IG Explore feed. If social media is a status game, putting players on equal footing is just about the greatest thing you can do for engagement. And really, <strong>you only have to make people think they have a chance</strong>.</p>

<p>So the common theme here is that TikTok did one thing really well: create an efficient meme factory. <strong>The conversion from idea to meme is near-frictionless. The distribution of your newly created meme is effortless.</strong> No need to growth hack with suggestive thumbnails and follow-4-followâ€™s, just let the algorithm run its course.</p>
<p>Rather than let attention follow a power-law distribution, <strong>TikTok democratized attention</strong> and memes.</p>
<p>And while Iâ€™m no advocate for fallible centralized systems (the Algorithm controls enough about our lives as is), itâ€™s a damn good way to grow a social network.</p>

<p>As a side note, some of my friends work on Instagramâ€™s algorithms. I've seen the work Facebook is putting into similar efforts. But now Iâ€™m forced to see Instagram as a dying network. A culture built on flexing* and highlighting your best moments canâ€™t compete against a culture that embraces mass-participation and sharing everyday living. </p>
<p>Just ask yourself, in our brave new post-flex world, where will you turn to find relatable content?</p>

<p>â€&nbsp; Of course, this is all assuming the algorithm isnâ€™t compromised. The risk of bad actors abusing it in order to subtly influence us and our youth is real.</p>
<p>* Because of all this Covid-19 funny business, we may very well be entering into a post-flex era of social media. This might be what finally changes Instagramâ€™s culture. So either we slowly turn our main Instagrams into our Finstas, or Instagram will become a place dominated by shitty FuckJerry accounts and generic aesthetic pictures. So basically, an inferior blend of Pinterest and Twitter.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The Next Frontiers of Search]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A quick introduction: I have spent quite some time working on (and daydreaming about) search, and mapping human knowledge. Both as a PM at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bing">Bing</a>, and with my current projects with <a target="_blank" href="https://getrumin.com/">Rumin</a>.</p>
        <p>This post is more speculations about the future and plausible paths to get there, than a rigorous research report. If you are interested in the latter, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:john@knowledgeartist.org">email me</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung">tweet at me @jhlyeung</a>.  </p>
        <h3>Search engines today</h3>
        <p>Today, a vast amount of content that is available in public can be looked up within miliseconds.</p>
        <p>In addition to the 10 blue links on the results page, search engines also provide: </p>
        <li>Instant answers and question answering, e.g. "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+in+toronto">weather in Toronto today</a>",  "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=MSFT+stock+price">MSFT stock price</a>", "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=who+is+the+president+of+the+u">Who is the president of the US?</a>"</li>
        <li>Voice assistants reading instant answers, playing the wrong song on Spotify, turning on lights to flex in front of your guests</li>
        <p>It is an impressive feat of engineering, and has been great for answering simple questions and looking up facts. But what lies ahead if we dare imagine the future possibilities?</p>
        <h3>No search at all</h3>
        <p>To get the piece of information you are looking for, going to google.com can sometimes feel like a hassle. A few clicks each time, plus the context switching, can add up in terms of time costs. </p>
        <p>A more desirable experience is to have the knowledge delivered to you, to whatever app or workspace you are in. So that you can get the information and resume what you are doing.</p>
        <p>You already see patterns like this today, where there many entry points to the search engine:</p>
        <li>The url address bar in the browser doubles as a search box</li>
        <li>The browser "New tab" page has a search box</li>
        <li>Operating systems have a search box: Spotlight on Mac. Cortana on Windows. Same deal on mobile</li>
        <li>"Smart lookup" in Microsoft Office products</li>
        <p>One day, we shall see a reincarnation of Clippy. One day.</p>
        <p>The idea is that you want the information the moment you need it. We will find more and more ways to eliminate the friction that stands between you and what you are searching. </p>
        <p>This brings us to our next point - searching across apps.</p>
        <h3>Intent understanding. Information layer across apps &amp; contexts</h3>
        <p>Everyone has experienced some version of trying to find a document or message across emails, instant messages, cloud storage, notes etc.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, this is still largely the case. Though there are a sea of big companies and startups alike working on solving this. It is a rather straightforward problem of integrating with various data sources and indexing the content. </p>
        <p>So it is probably safe to expect this to be less of an issue over time.</p>
        <p>We would always be looking for shortcuts to get what we are looking for, faster. This is a part of a much bigger trend of automation and connected apps, which is not limited to search. </p>
        <p>But search engines, as a general-purpose intent understanding machine, have a big role to play in this. We can expect to see more deep links and actions being accessible from a central interface. Alexa playing your favorite podcast is only the beginning. </p>
        <h3>Querying huge, generative language models</h3>
        <p>When you have a question, the most natural thing to do for most people is to ask someone. </p>
        <p>When Google came along and became a verb, the convention became to just ask the Googs. Sure there are still loads of questions it can't answer, that a real person can. But it's good enough. And it's instant.</p>
        <p>That could very well change in the near future. Generative language models that are trained a huge corpus of human-generated data on the internet can spit out answers that are often as good as a real human's response.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, OpenAI recently released an API to its latest GPT-3 model. From all the anecdotes I have read, it seems it is pretty darn good! Generating a general purpose human-like response seems to good enough to be usable. </p>
        <p>It does seem too far for a language model to do what the search engine currently does, provided that it can:</p>
        <li>Map the generated output to a credible source. This would address the "black box" concerns that people have.</li>
        <li>Refresh content - "index" and "train" on fresh content. This is similar to how a human being would "stay updated" by reading the news and having conversations. </li>
        <p>When that happens, perhaps we wouldn't even call it a search engine. Would "oracle" seem more apt?</p>
        <h3>Indexing the unindexed knowledge</h3>
        <p>Both search engines and large language models rely on crawled data on the web. This means the scope of their knowledge and capabilities are limited to that dataset. </p>
        <p>In particular, the limitations include: </p>
        <li>The content must be published somewhere on the web, and is publicly available. This excludes the wealth private and individual knowledge.</li>
        <li>Data on the web is predominantly text. Which means scope is limited to whatever can be expressed in natural language. There is a tremendous amount of implicit or tacit knowledge that is hard to transfer verbally.</li>
        <li>Content tends to be shallow. There are countless domains of knowledge that are still not very legible and accessible, even for humans.</li>
        <p>Given the limitations, here are a few exciting areas of development:</p>
        <li>Indexing private knowledge, and integrating it with the collective public knowledge. </li>
        <li>Better UIs and formats, to help externalize and digitze complex ideas that are hard to convey in plain text.</li>
        <li>Represent and map out the deep knowledge in each field.</li>
        <p>That covers the knowledge side of things. But so much of the human condition isn't about just knowing...</p>
        <h3>Indexing perception, emotions, and experiences  </h3>
        <p>What we know accounts for just a small fraction of our conscious experience. There are myriad sensations that are hard to even find words for. This is especially true for experiences in altered states - for instance, from meditation, bodily movements, or consuming substances.</p>
        <p>But what if we can enlist the help of machines to map out and navigate how we feel? Can we index an emotional experience and construct a sequence of steps to recreate or revisit this moment?</p>
        <p>This sounds incredibly challenging. And by this point we are venturing quite far into the future. It would be fun though, to entertain a few possibilities. </p>
        <p>It helps to recognize that we already have reliable heuristics, in various domains of art, that roughly predict what our experiences will be like. Eating ice cream on a hot summer day is satisfying. Stomping backbeats make music easy to dance to. Symmetry is generally pleasing to the eye. Exercising makes you tired in the moment, and you feel good at night.</p>
        <p>These broad stroke heuristics are distilled from many instances of trial-and-error and observations. What happens if we more systematically gather data at scale and analyze it?</p>
        <p>We could in principle achieve fine-grained predictions and control of human experiences: in terms of precision in time, evoking the exact sensation desired, and personalization.</p>
        <p>In this setup, the role of human beings would be sensors and interpreters, while machines maintain and find patterns in the collective data.</p>
        <p>Perhaps soon enough, we would be able to guess the inner state of any person, based on known information about the sequence of inputs and stimuli in the current environment. And the machine can construct a model of the person's mind, as a time-series sequence of perceptual frames, with each frame being a digital representation (say, an embedding) of the sensation.</p>
        <p>This is a good place to wrap. I will elaborate and flesh out some of the themes above in future posts. </p>
        <p>What an exciting world we live in!</p>

        <p>A long time I presented a <a href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/09/27/instant-access-to-your-shell-init-file/">simple hack</a> that allowed you to
quickly navigate to your shell’s user config file (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code> or
<code>.zshrc</code>). While the solution gets the job done it was pretty basic and
limited - most notably it’d ignore the fact that you typically have several
shell config files that are often built on top of each other - e.g.  <code>/etc/profile</code>,
<code>~/.bash_profile</code> and <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Fortunately the original
hack evolved rather nicely and today lives in the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/crux">crux</a> library under the name
<code>crux-find-shell-init-file</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Provided you’ve installed <code>crux</code> all you need to do is run that command
(e.g. with <code>M-x crux-find-shell-init-file</code>) and you’ll get something like this
as the result:</p>

<p>I guess one thing that we can improve down the road is adding an option to
display the shell config in the same window, but that’s a small thing.  The variables
like <code>crux-shell-bash-init-files</code> are simply lists of all potential files that
we should look for, that’s why I’ve opted to omit them from the code listing.</p>

<p>I stand by my original suggestion to bind this useful command to <code>C-c S</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>global-set-key</span> <span>(</span><span>kbd</span> <span>"C-c S"</span><span>)</span> <span>#'</span><span>crux-find-shell-init-file</span><span>)</span>

<p>That’s all I have for you today! Meta-x forever!</p>

<p><em>O<em>r, some thoughts on the theory of bid-ask spreads in gambling markets</em></em></p>



<p>One of the things I’ve found interesting to think about for a few months now is how spreads and odds get set by bookmakers. I’ve written a bit about this before, in terms of how the line gets set, but also think it’s worth considering how the house edge is set on any given market. In the simplest terms, what determines whether a two-sided market is -110 on both sides<span id="easy-footnote-1-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-186" title="~4.55% house edge"><sup>1</sup></a></span> or -115 on both sides <span id="easy-footnote-2-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-186" title="~6.52% house edge"><sup>2</sup></a></span>, or some other number? Put differently, and more broadly, this can be thought of as a question around efficiency and liquidity in gambling markets, and what determines the bid-ask spread.</p>



<p>It’s useful to start with how lines get set. Broadly speaking, bookmakers begin by opening markets at prices they think reflect the ‘right price’ for a game, based on their actual expectations of performance, expectations of people’s bets, and a variety of other factors<span id="easy-footnote-3-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-186" title="Contrary to popular belief, it is not entirely based on &amp;#8220;what gets me 50-50 on each side&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; I wrote a bit about this before, <strong><a href=&quot;http://conordurkin.com/bookmakers-and-keynesian-beauty-contests/&quot;>h</a></strong><strong><a href=&quot;http://conordurkin.com/bookmakers-and-keynesian-beauty-contests/&quot;>e</a></strong><strong><a href=&quot;http://conordurkin.com/bookmakers-and-keynesian-beauty-contests/&quot;>r</a></strong><strong><a href=&quot;http://conordurkin.com/bookmakers-and-keynesian-beauty-contests/&quot;>e</a></strong>."><sup>3</sup></a></span>. Gamblers (or market participants, if you prefer to sound more academic) then places wagers in these markets, moving the line one way or another based on their aggregate volumes, and the line eventually moves to a more efficient equilibrium price such that future bets aren’t one-sided and won’t move the market<span id="easy-footnote-4-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-186" title="One very very important clarification here: this is not as basic as seeing which side has more volume and shifting the line accordingly; there is far more too it than that. Just as electronic stock market makers or HFTs will likely shift their markets if they know they&amp;#8217;re getting retail volume from someone like Robinhood as opposed to institutional interest from some smart hedge fund, bookmakers will absolutely move their lines differently depending on whether they&amp;#8217;re receiving a few big bets from some random Joe Public as opposed to receiving big bets from known sharp gamblers. While enough one-sidedness of the former *may* move a line, it is much, much, much more the case that they will respond to the latter (and quickly)."><sup>4</sup></a></span>.</p>



<p>At the highest level: markets which reach that equilibrium price faster should have tighter bid-ask spreads. In a gambling context, that should be reflected in the form of a lower vig; the most efficient market possible would be one offering true odds<span id="easy-footnote-5-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-186" title="E.g. +100 on either side of a 50-50 outcome."><sup>5</sup></a></span>, with any house edge eating away at liquidity in some aspect. The key here is that the tightness of a bid-ask spread is reflective of the risk that the marketmaker is taking; in situations where the marketmaker can trust that he is not exposed to as much risk<span id="easy-footnote-6-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-186" title="Because the price is correct, or because the market is liquid enough that in the long run he will certainly reach the right price."><sup>6</sup></a></span>, then he should be willing to offer a tighter market to attract more bets.</p>



<p>What makes a market reach that price faster? It’s primarily a function of liquidity. A market with a lot of gamblers, a lot of bets, and a lot of dollars at stake has a lot more volume and is a lot more liquid. Consequently, there’s enough activity going on that you’re able to reach the ‘right price’ a lot quicker. It’s not that the prices in these market necessarily start any more accurately than any others; they just move more quickly into equilibrium much more quickly. This is pretty straightforward to see in the gambling world; the most heavily bet markets are generally NFL games (both spreads and totals), and those bets are generally regarded as most efficient and hardest to find an edge on<span id="easy-footnote-7-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-186" title="Again, unless you&amp;#8217;re waiting at the window until the minute they open and sharp gamblers haven&amp;#8217;t had an opportunity to move the prices into equilibrium yet."><sup>7</sup></a></span>.</p>



<p>Beyond liquidity, events with more precisely well-known mathematical odds should also be more efficient markets, and this should again be reflected in tighter spreads. However, in this instance the efficiency is a function of the event itself rather than a function of the market participants – if the true odds are particularly well known, the marketmaker can be more confident that his opening lines are already the ‘efficient prices’ and he doesn’t have to rely on gamblers to get him there. As an example, one of the popular Super Bowl prop bets offered every year is whether the coin toss will be Heads or Tails. Prop bets (or derivative bets) tend to get less action than most ‘regular’ bets, and they usually have larger vigs to reflect the fact that they’re less efficient markets. But this is an obviously 50-50 proposition, it’s a literal coin flip – and I think every time I’ve seen the prop offered, it’s been a -105 bet<span id="easy-footnote-8-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-186" title="~2.38% house edge"><sup>8</sup></a></span> on either side, reflecting that fact.</p>



<p>Conversely, less liquid or well-known stuff should in contrast see wider spreads. I already mentioned derivative (or prop) bets as one example here; less money chasing those markets means prices can remain inefficient longer, and there’s a higher risk of one-sided traffic<span id="easy-footnote-9-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-186" title="In a liquid market with lots of bettors, you&amp;#8217;ll have enough volume on both sides of a betting market for the price to reach equilibrium and be &amp;#8216;efficient&amp;#8217;. In a smaller market, you might never reach that equilibrium price if the market started at a bad price, so the net exposure to the bookmaker is very one-sided. This is fairly evidently riskier for the bookmaker."><sup>9</sup></a></span>. In some instances, you can actually see the ‘efficiency as liquidity’ question play out in real time, with not just the lines moving dynamically, but the size of the spreads as well. In college football, for example, while most big college football games are pretty liquid markets, FCS games are much less commonly bet. I’ve very frequently seen markets start at -120 or -125 on Monday morning, but have those spreads shrink to -110 on Saturday around noon when it’s almost gametime. Why are they able to tighten the market? Because by that point they feel pretty good about the quality of the price they’re offering, so they have less need to protect against price risk – despite the fact that it was perfectly logical for them to do so a few days prior.</p>



<p>One particularly interesting ‘less liquid’ example is in futures betting <span id="easy-footnote-10-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-186" title="For example, &amp;#8220;Which team will win the World Series?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; markets which deal not with one event happening quickly, but that deal with a bigger event happening down the road"><sup>10</sup></a></span>, which has two real wrinkles to deal with. First, time lag – these events are all things that happen in the future, not today, and the correct probabilities will evolve over time. This creates some level of uncertainty risk in that the efficient prices will change over time, could change dramatically over time, and even if the market lands on the efficient prices today the marketmaker faces a real risk that in the future the market won’t remain liquid enough to stay efficient as prices evolve. That uncertainty ends up reflected in a wider spread. Secondly, these are typically not 1-on-1 outcomes; there’s a whole field of potential options<span id="easy-footnote-11-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-186" title="For example, there are 30 teams that could win the World Series. Okay, maybe 29 &amp;#8211; the Orioles aren&amp;#8217;t getting it done this year, even with a 60 game season."><sup>11</sup></a></span>. As such, getting to “equilibrium” is a lot harder because it’s not about A vs B, it’s about A, B, C… to Z all being reasonably efficient prices. Liquidity is a lot harder because even with a lot of people betting, there’s no guarantee you’ll receive enough volume on each individual possible outcome of the futures market for the prices to be accurate; it’s a lot easier for a few to be out of whack. Books end up protecting against this by having a much, much higher hold in futures markets than in regular betting – where the house edge is usually something like 4-5% in any typical point spread, the total house edge in most futures markets is often 20-30% or more.</p>



<p>Another example is in live betting, where wagers are accepted during the actual course of play of a game. These markets typically see much wider spreads (something like -120 on each side instead of -110), largely because the timeframe in which bettors can move the price is basically nonexistant – the game is already going on! Bookmakers either have to be very very confident in the prices they offer or offer a less liquid market to protect themselves. They generally choose the latter.</p>



<p>It’s also worth thinking about alternative forms of illiquidity, where you can get tighter spreads at the cost of something else. One example is betting exchanges like Betfair – rather than having a marketmaker take your risk, these exchanges use a peer-to-peer market where your wager remains pending until some other bettor wants to take the other side. Because the exchange isn’t taking any risk themselves, they’re protected against any ‘inefficient prices’ and never have any net exposure, so bettors are able to benefit from tighter spreads<span id="easy-footnote-12-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-186" title="Betfair typically charges a commission of ~5% on winning tickets, which works out to a house edge of ~2.5%"><sup>12</sup></a></span>, at the cost of some execution risk (you’re not guaranteed for your wager to be received until someone takes the other side). Another example is in parimutuel betting, where odds are constantly fluctuating and the actual odds at which a bet is locked in are not set until shortly prior to the event occurring (this is pretty popular in horse racing). The house takes a fixed percentage from the total pool of wagers and then pays out according to the final odds, so they’re again not taking any risk. From the bettor’s perspective, you can get a tighter ‘spread’ and you’re guaranteed to have your bet be valid, but you’re not guaranteed on the actual price, since that will still move around even after your bet is placed<span id="easy-footnote-13-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-186" title="For whatever reason, my understanding is that parimutuel horseracing still has a pretty healthy house cut. I still think intuitively the parimutuel format should lend itself to allowing for tighter spreads, but evidently that&amp;#8217;s not always the case."><sup>13</sup></a></span>.</p>



<p>Okay, now that we’re 1400 words into this – what’re the implications of all of this to the average gambler? In my experience a lot of times people see markets with lines at -115 or -120 and get annoyed at the bookmaker’s apparent stinginess. If that’s happening on a major event like an NFL or college football game, then sure, that doesn’t seem appropriate. But if that’s happening on more obscure events, it’s not indicative of cheapness – it’s indicative of the marketmaker being afraid that their price is wrong, and that means it’s an opportunity. Despite wider spreads, the average bettor is far more likely to be able to profit betting into markets with less efficient prices than they are into markets with tight spreads and perfectly efficient prices. Ed Miller and Matthew Davidow make this point really well in <em>The Logic of Sports Betting</em><span id="easy-footnote-14-186"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-14-186" title="I&amp;#8217;d like to be abundantly clear that I am not here to market this book, nor am I being compensated for it but it is an excellent read, and if you care about this sort of thing you should absolutely read it."><sup>14</sup></a></span> when they get into the idea of ‘strong markets versus weak markets,’ and the need for savvy gamblers to attack the latter – when markets are less liquid, spreads are often wider, but they’re less efficient, and that means they are much more likely to be beatable.</p>

<strong>Bharath Hariharan:</strong> Humans can basically very quickly learn new things. They know exactly when they see something new, they can learn from very few training examples, and they can learn with very little computational effort. Whereas current techniques, they can only learn a small number of things with lots of examples and lots of computational effort. That’s a big gap which causes all sorts of issues when you apply these techniques to the real world.</p>

<p>[ringing tone]</p>

<p>[00:00:38]<br>
<strong>Soham Sankaran:</strong> Welcome to Episode 2 of Segfault, from Honesty is Best. Segfault is a podcast about Computer Science research. This episode is about computer vision, and it features Professor Bharath Hariharan from Cornell University. I’m your host, Soham Sankaran. I’m the CEO of Pashi, a startup building software for manufacturing, and I’m on leave from the Ph.D program at Cornell University, located in perpetually sunny Ithaca, New York.</p>

<p>I’m the CEO of Pashi, a start-up building software for manufacturing, and I’m on leave from the PhD program in Computer Science at Cornell University, located in perpetually sunny Ithaca, New York. Computer Science is composed of many different areas of research, such as Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Algorithms and Cryptography. Each of these areas has its own problems of interest, publications of record, idioms of communication, and styles of thought, not to mention, one level deeper, a multitude of sub-areas, just as varied as the areas they are contained within.</p>

<p>This can get extremely confusing very quickly, and I certainly didn’t know how to navigate this terrain at all until I was in graduate school. Segfault, in aggregate, is intended to be a map of the field, with each episode featuring discussions about the core motivations, ideas and methods of one particular area, with a mix of academics ranging from first year graduate students to long tenured professors. I hope that listeners who have dipped their toes in computer science or programming, but haven’t necessarily been exposed to research, get a sense of not only the foundations of each area – what work is being done in it now, and what sorts of opportunities for new research exist for people just entering, but also what it is about each specific area that compelled my guests to work in it in the first place, and what the experience of doing research in that area every day actually feels like.</p>

<p>This is the map of CS that I didn’t even know I desperately wanted in high school and undergrad, and I hope folks who are just starting their journey in computer science will find within it ideas that will excite them so much, and so viscerally, that they can’t help but work on them.</p>

<p>Just a quick note. The first episode was about the research area of programming languages. If you haven’t already listened to it, you can find it at <a href="https://honestyisbest.com/segfault/2020/Jun/16/programming-languages">honestyisbest.com/segfault</a>. My company, Pashi, is actually hiring someone with experience in programming languages and compilers, both in industry and in academia. If you fit this description, or know somebody that does, please reach out – send me an email at soham@pashi.com.</p>

<p>[ringing sound]</p>

<p>[00:02:44]<br>
<strong>Soham:</strong> So I’m with Professor Bharath Hariharan, who does computer vision. If you just want to introduce yourself briefly…</p>

<p>[00:02:50]<br>
<strong>Bharath:</strong> I’m Bharath. I do computer vision and machine learning. My interests are in visual recognition. I came here after a few years at FAIR – Facebook AI Research – and before that I was a Ph.D student at UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>[00:03:03]<br>
<strong>Soham:</strong> Where you worked with Jitendra Malik, who is one of the pioneers of vision recently.</p>

<p>[00:03:10]<br>
<strong>Bharath:</strong> Yeah. He’s one of the… yes.</p>

<p>[00:03:15]<br>
<strong>Soham:</strong> So, what was it that got you into computer vision in the first place? What was your journey to choosing this as a research field?</p>

<p>[00:03:21]<br>
<strong>Bharath:</strong> A variety of things. So I think the first source of my interest was that I was actually originally interested in psychology and how brains work. I think that’s been a longstanding interest of mine, and when I started working on computer science, when I started studying computer science, that was the thing I kept going back to. Like, why can’t computers do the things humans can? The other part of it was just images and visual media. Earlier, I had a brief infatuation with computer graphics, which also led to this question of ‘Why can’t machines understand images as well as humans do?’ So that’s sort of roughly the route I took, which is a fairly short route, but it serves as the motivation.</p>

<p>[00:04:12]<br>
<strong>Soham:</strong> What was the first problem that was very interesting for you in vision? Or the first problem that you worked on?</p>

<p>[00:04:18]<br>

<p>In the last couple of months since Ireland announced the lockdown, our team has been performing at a high pace and have become self-organised to a large extent. As a team lead, this has allowed me the privilege of stepping back to look at the broader picture of how our team works individually and, more importantly, together. Through some exercises, I have identified some  methods to gather improvement ideas that can be applied to any team. </p>



<p>Anyone who has been a part of a high functioning team understands that continuous improvement is not optional. In order to perform better and to keep performing, the team must identify their weaknesses and plan to strengthen or mitigate those weaknesses. These improvements remedy stress points in the team, technical debt, repetitive tasks and so forth. The mindset of continuous growth is one that must be worked on and nurtured over time. Your team is not a fine wine – it will not improve if left alone in the corner. It will go sour.</p>



<p>It is one thing to be told to improve something. But very often, being told to improve something does not necessarily benefit you or your team.&nbsp;For example, if my manager comes to me and tells me my communication is poor and he wants bi-weekly emails from now on from my team’s status, all he has done is improve one of his problems, not mine. Improvements must come from within the team, and they must be gathered and executed on regularly. So the question is – how do we gather improvements that are worthwhile and specific enough to solve our problems, not someone else’s?</p>



<h2>80/20 Analysis</h2>



<p>The Pareto Principle, most commonly known as the 80/20 rule, states that about 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In layman’s terms, most of the good things your team is known for doing likely comes from a small subset of your total work.</p>



<p>In my case, my team is known for our expertise in the upgrading of our product. How much of our work is related to this each week? I’d estimate less than 10%.</p>



<p>S<em>ide note</em>: This wasn’t always the case. When we first formed as a team, we spent about 90% of our time on this work. </p>



<p>Over time our mindset of continuous improvement led us to automating away most of our problems. Here is how you can utilize the 80/20 rule to find pressure points to improve. I do this regularly by myself, and occasionally with my team.</p>



<h3>Create a chart.</h3>



<p>Drawing on a piece of paper or whiteboard produces far more ideas than typing on a screen. So create a chart!</p>



<h4>What is going poorly?</h4>



<p>Always start with the bad. What makes you stressed on a Monday? Why does your team constantly get called for customer escalations on a Sunday? What makes you cry at night? (If you’re crying at night you really need this). </p>



<p>Copy the following table onto a piece of paper and fill it out now with any ideas you have.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>20% Activity</strong></th><th><strong>80% Pain</strong></th><th><strong>Action to Remedy</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Monday morning team presentation to management.</td><td>Stressful if I’m not prepped.</td><td>Give a practice run to my team on Friday.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h4>What is going well?</h4>



<p>This is less effective than analyzing what is poor in the team. You should prioritise fixing the bad over improving the good. There is no point in improving what your team is already good at if there are still issues that stress them. </p>



<p>Ask yourself – what are your team doing well? What do you need to keep doing well? What would happen if you improved these items?</p>



<p>Again, copy the following table onto a piece of paper and fill it out.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>20% Activity</strong></th><th><strong>80% Reward</strong></th><th><strong>Improvement reward</strong></th><th><strong>Action to improve</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Quick bug turnaround.</td><td>No weekend work.</td><td>Become the team with the lowest bug turnaround time.</td><td>Make incoming bugs a priority over stories.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>You see the action columns? Take those, discuss with the team whether they agree on the actions required, and put them clearly for all to see everyday. You could create a task in your backlog that gets seen everyday on your sprint board, or print them and place them in your team’s area.</p>



<h2>Preventative Actions</h2>



<p>Identifying Preventative Actions is something that I have recently come across. Each team in my project go through this process every 3 weeks (every sprint). Here’s how it works. </p>



<p>A high priority bug has come into your team. You have spent all weekend pouring over it with your team, and finally came up with a solution late Sunday night, allowing your customer to continue their business as usual. Before you close the bug, there are a couple of things you need to consider and you <strong>must</strong> get answers to them. Otherwise, there will be another weekend in the future that will interrupt your team.</p>



<h3>Why did this bug occur?</h3>



<ul><li>We received a bad requirement specification from our business analysts.</li><li>We missed a corner case in our testware.</li><li>There were too many manual steps in the documentation which led to human error.</li><li>We missed a critical part of our study when planning the requirement.</li></ul>



<h3>What correction did you apply?</h3>



<ul><li>We built a patch fix and sent it to the customer.</li><li>We clarified with the customer that the particular use case reported is not supported yet.</li></ul>



<h3>How will you prevent this type of issue from occurring in the future?</h3>



<ul><li>We will call a 1 hour meeting with our business analyst each week to plan and clarify the feature request.</li><li>We will build a new pipeline that will test our customer’s use case each night.</li><li>We will automate steps x,y and z in our documentation so that human error is reduced.</li></ul>



<p>In my team’s case, for each bug we have the following grid which we fill out.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Root Cause</strong></th><th><strong>Correction Applied</strong></th><th><strong>Preventative Action</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A test case to click on the ‘About’ page in Firefox was missing from our GUI test suite.</td><td>Added this test case to the GUI suite.</td><td>Review GUI test cases as part of a feature sign-off in the future.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Retrospective</h2>



<p>If your team uses the scrum framework for their work, then you will be very familiar with the retrospective. However, you do not need to work in a scrum environment to have a team retrospective. </p>



<p>Team retrospectives, if taken regularly, can be a valuable tool in the team’s work week and is an opportunity for the team to come together and discuss the good and bad things that have happened in the past few weeks. </p>



<p>A retro should be scheduled on a regular basis, and you as the team lead must lead the meeting. Make sure that everyone from the team is present for the retro, and ensure that everyone is taking part and answering the questions.</p>



<h3>What was good that you need to keep doing?</h3>



<ul><li>We closed out 100% of our stories for the sprint.</li><li>There was good communication with our management.</li><li>We trialed pair programming this sprint – we have seen excellent results and should continue to do this.</li></ul>



<h3>What was bad?</h3>



<ul><li>We had poor communication within the team.<ul><li><em>Improvement</em>: We will trial pair programming for a sprint.</li></ul></li><li>The QA team raised tickets with very little detail resulting in a few days of delay in closing.<ul><li><em>Improvement</em>: Create a template that you would find helpful and send it to the QA team lead. Request that they copy this template and fill it out for all future tickets.</li></ul></li><li>We allowed untested code into the production software.<ul><li><em>Improvement</em>: Revise the +2 code review criteria with the team.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The most important part of the retro is to make sure that improvements or solutions are attached to each ‘bad’ item that is discussed.<br>At the end of the retro, prioritise the top one or two improvements, and take note of them for the upcoming sprint to execute.</p>



<h2>Improvement Backlog</h2>



<p>To become a top performing team, each individual must be comfortable with raising and discussing improvements as part of the team’s responsibilities. A team that does not have improvement ideas is a team that is not interested in improving which will lead to stagnation and a low performing team.</p>



<p>An improvement backlog is a list of ideas maintained and prioritised by the team. The list can be physical, like stickies on a whiteboard, or digital, like part of your jira backlog. </p>



<p>For example, my team created a Jira sprint and named it ‘Improvement Ideas’. We have list about 50 improvement ideas, most of which are one-liners and some of which have been discussed with details and acceptance criteria attached.</p>



<p>Each sprint planning, we prioritise this list and take the items we feel are most valuable to us. We have a couple of ad-hoc rules for this backlog.</p>



<ul><li>Any ideas that come up in meetings are inserted as a ‘one-liners’ in this backlog.</li><li>The list is regularly prioritised each sprint.</li><li>Each idea is explained by the team member who originally raised it.</li><li>We take 10-20% of our sprint capacity for improvements.</li></ul>



<p>Keeping this backlog up to date and prioritised will ensure that your team has consistent tasks to work on that primarily help the team.</p>



<h2>Stakeholder Feedback</h2>



<p>Working in a team can often be like working in a bubble. It is tempting to fall into confirmation bias. The most valuable improvements you can get for your product will come from your customers and stakeholders. </p>



<p>Leading the team does not only include leading the people on the team. If your team are known for building the wrong thing, or if their customers are not satisfied with their part of the product, then you as the team lead have ultimately failed.</p>



<p>When it comes to feedback, there is nothing more valuable than your own customers’ feedback. Your customers drive your product backlog. If you are in a large company, you may not have direct contact with your customers. In big companies, customers are often separated by layers of business analysts and management. This is not ideal, but it is something you can work around. </p>



<p>All you need is a small list of stakeholders that consistently use your product area to gain feedback from them. Talk to your managers about the customer interface and who could give feedback. In my case, we were 6 months without any contact with stakeholders that could give us valuable feedback. Eventually we were able to make friends with two guys who act as an interface to one of our company’s top …</p></article></div>

<p><code>redo</code> is a competitor to the long-lived, but sadly imperfect, <code>make</code>
program.  Unlike other such competitors, redo captures the essential
simplicity and flexibility of make, while avoiding its flaws.  It manages to
do this while being simultaneously simpler than make, more flexible than
make, and more powerful than make, and without sacrificing performance - a
rare combination of features.</p>
<p>The original design for redo comes from Daniel J. Bernstein (creator of
qmail and djbdns, among many other useful things).  He posted some
terse notes on his web site at one point (there is no date) with the
unassuming title, "<a href="http://cr.yp.to/redo.html">Rebuilding target files when source files have
changed</a>." Those notes are enough information to
understand how the system is supposed to work; unfortunately there's no code
to go with it.  I wrote this implementation of redo from scratch, based on
that design.</p>
<p>After I found out about djb redo, I searched the Internet for any sign that
other people had discovered what I had: a hidden, unimplemented gem of
brilliant code design.  I found only one interesting link at the time: Alan
Grosskurth, whose <a href="http://grosskurth.ca/papers/mmath-thesis.pdf">Master's thesis at the University of
Waterloo</a> was about top-down
software rebuilding, that is, djb redo.  He wrote his own (admittedly slow)
implementation in about 250 lines of shell script, which gives an idea for
how straightforward the system is.  Since then, several other
implementations have appeared (see list below).</p>
<p>My implementation of redo is called <code>redo</code> for the same reason that there
are 75 different versions of <code>make</code> that are all called <code>make</code>.  It's somehow
easier that way.</p>
<p>I also provide an extremely minimal pure-POSIX-sh implementation, called
<code>do</code>, in the <code>minimal/</code> directory of this repository.</p>
<p>(Want to discuss redo?  Join <a href="https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contributing/#mailing-list">our mailing list</a>.)</p>

<p>The theory behind redo sounds too good to be true: it can do everything
<code>make</code> can do, but the implementation is vastly simpler, the syntax is
cleaner, and you have even more flexibility without resorting to ugly hacks. 
Also, you get all the speed of non-recursive <code>make</code> (only check dependencies
once per run) combined with all the cleanliness of recursive <code>make</code> (you
don't have code from one module stomping on code from another module).</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: my current implementation is not as fast as <code>make</code> for some
things, because it's written in python.  Eventually I'll rewrite it an C and
it'll be very, very fast.)</p>
<p>The easiest way to show it is to jump into an example.  Here's one for
compiling a C++ program.</p>
<p>Create a file called default.o.do:</p>
<pre><code>redo-ifchange $2.c
gcc -MD -MF $2.d -c -o $3 $2.c
read DEPS &lt;$2.d
redo-ifchange ${DEPS#*:}
</code></pre>
<p>Create a file called myprog.do:</p>
<pre><code>DEPS="a.o b.o"
redo-ifchange $DEPS
gcc -o $3 $DEPS
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you'll also have to create <code>a.c</code> and <code>b.c</code>, the C language
source files that you want to build to create your application.</p>
<p>In a.c:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "b.h"

int main() { printf(bstr); }
</code></pre>
<p>In b.h:</p>
<pre><code>extern char *bstr;
</code></pre>
<p>In b.c:</p>
<pre><code>char *bstr = "hello, world!\n";
</code></pre>
<p>Now you simply run:</p>
<pre><code>$ redo myprog
</code></pre>
<p>And it says:</p>
<pre><code>redo  myprog
redo    a.o
redo    b.o
</code></pre>
<p>Now try this:</p>
<pre><code>$ touch b.h
$ redo myprog
</code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, it says:</p>
<pre><code>redo  myprog
redo    a.o
</code></pre>
<p>Did you catch the shell incantation in <code>default.o.do</code> where it generates
the autodependencies?  The filename <code>default.o.do</code> means "run this script to
generate a .o file unless there's a more specific whatever.o.do script that
applies."</p>
<p>The key thing to understand about redo is that declaring a dependency is just
another shell command.  The <code>redo-ifchange</code> command means, "build each of my
arguments.  If any of them or their dependencies ever change, then I need to
run the <em>current script</em> over again."</p>
<p>Dependencies are tracked in a persistent <code>.redo</code> database so that redo can
check them later.  If a file needs to be rebuilt, it re-executes the
<code>whatever.do</code> script and regenerates the dependencies.  If a file doesn't
need to be rebuilt, redo figures that out just using its persistent
<code>.redo</code> database, without re-running the script.  And it can do that check
just once right at the start of your project build, which is really fast.</p>
<p>Best of all, as you can see in <code>default.o.do</code>, you can declare a dependency
<em>after</em> building the program.  In C, you get your best dependency
information by trying to actually build, since that's how you find out which
headers you need.  redo is based on this simple insight: you don't
actually care what the dependencies are <em>before</em> you build the target.  If
the target doesn't exist, you obviously need to build it.</p>
<p>Once you're building it anyway, the build script itself can calculate the
dependency information however it wants; unlike in <code>make</code>, you don't need a
special dependency syntax at all.  You can even declare some of your
dependencies after building, which makes C-style autodependencies much
simpler.</p>
<p>redo therefore is a unique combination of imperative and declarative
programming.  The initial build is almost entirely imperative (running a
series of scripts).  As part of that, the scripts declare dependencies a few
at a time, and redo assembles those into a larger data structure.  Then, in
the future, it uses that pre-declared data structure to decide what work
needs to be redone.</p>
<p>(GNU make supports putting some of your dependencies in include files, and
auto-reloading those include files if they change.  But this is very
confusing - the program flow through a Makefile is hard to trace already,
and even harder when it restarts from the beginning because an include file
changes at runtime.  With redo, you can just read each build script from top
to bottom.  A <code>redo-ifchange</code> call is like calling a function, which you can
also read from top to bottom.)</p>

<p>Some larger proprietary projects are using it, but unfortunately they can't
easily be linked from this document.  Here are a few open source examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/linleyh/liberation-circuit">Liberation Circuit</a> is a
  straightforward example of a C++ binary (a game) compiled with redo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/wvstreams">WvStreams</a> uses a more complex
  setup producing several binaries, libraries, and scripts.  It shows how to
  produce output files in a different directory than the source files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/wvbuild">WvBuild</a> can cross-compile several
  dependencies, like openssl and zlib, and then builds WvStreams using those
  same libraries.  It's a good example of redo/make interop and complex
  dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's an experimental <a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/buildroot/tree/redo">variant of
  Buildroot</a> that uses redo
  in order to clean up its dependency logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can find some curated tutorial examples in the
  <a href="https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/hello/">cookbook</a>, such as <a href="https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/defaults/">git variable
  substitution</a> and <a href="https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/latex/">text processing with
  LaTeX</a> (including plot generation with R and ggplot2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/search?p=9&amp;q=path%3A%2F+extension%3Ado+filename%3A%2Fall.do&amp;type=Code">github search for all.do</a>
  shows an ever-growing number of projects using redo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you switch your program's build process to use redo, please let us know and
we can link to it here for some free publicity.</p>
<p>(Please don't use the integration testing code in the redo project's <code>t/</code>
directory as serious examples of how to use redo.  Many of the tests are
doing things in intentionally psychotic ways in order to stress redo's code
and find bugs.  On the other hand, if you're building your own
reimplementation of redo, using our test suite is a great idea.)</p>

<p>djb never released his version, so other people have implemented their own
variants based on his <a href="http://cr.yp.to/redo.html">published specification</a>.</p>
<p>This version, sometimes called apenwarr/redo, is probably the most advanced
one, including support for parallel builds,
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20181113">resilient timestamps</a> and checksums,
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20181106">build log linearization</a>, and
helpful debugging features.  It's currently written in python for easier
experimentation, but the plan is to eventually migrate it to plain C.  (Some
people like to call this version "python-redo", but I don't like that name. 
We shouldn't have to rename it when we later transliterate the code to C.)</p>
<p>Here are some other redo variants (thanks to Nils Dagsson Moskopp for

<p>The original redo design is so simple and elegant that many individuals
have been
inspired to (and able to) write their own version of it.  In the honoured
tradition of Unix's <code>make</code>, they (almost) all just use the same name,
<code>redo</code>.  Unfortunately, many of these
implementations are unmaintained, slightly incompatible with the "standard"
redo semantics, and/or have few or no automated tests.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, none of them except apenwarr/redo (ie.  this
project) correctly support parallel builds (<code>redo -j</code>) or log linearization
(<code>redo-log</code>).  For large projects, parallel builds are usually considered
essential.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/redo/tree/master/t">automated tests</a> in
this version of redo are almost, but not quite, appropriate for testing any
redo implementation.  If you really must write a new version of redo, we
invite you to thoroughly test it against the existing test suite to ensure
compatibility.  You can also steal our tests (with attribution, of course)
and include them in your own source package.  We'd also love it it you
contribute more automated tests when you find a bug, or send us patches if
you find a test which is accidentally incompatible (as opposed to finding a
real bug) with other redo implementations.</p>

<h3>New coating can eliminate complex disinfectant procedures for protective face shields</h3>
<p>Acting like an invisible force field, a new liquid coating being developed by UBC Okanagan researchers may provide an extra layer of protection for front-line workers.</p>
<p>Researchers at the <a href="https://apsc-golovin.sites.olt.ubc.ca/">Okanagan Polymer Engineering Research and Applications</a> (OPERA) Lab have developed a coating that repels nearly all substances off a surface. And that new coating will make cleaning personal protective equipment a little bit easier for front-line health care workers, explains Kevin Golovin, an assistant professor at UBCO’s School of Engineering and director at OPERA.</p>
<p>Surfaces that can repel a broad range of liquids are called omniphobic, explains UBCO master's student and lead author of the study Behrooz Khatir. Working in Golovin’s lab, Khatir has created a spray-on solution that can make any surface, including a face shield, omniphobic.</p>
<p>“Omniphobic—all-liquid repellent—films can repel a broad range of liquids, but the applicability of these coatings has always been limited to silicon wafers or smooth glass,” says Khatir. “This new formulation can coat and protect just about any surface, including metals, paper, ceramics and even plastics.”</p>
<p>The two-layer coating involves placing an ultra-smooth silica layer on a surface and then functionalizing this layer with a highly-reactive silicone to effectively block all kinds of liquids from sticking on the surface, explains Golovin.</p>
<p>Not only does the coating repel countless substances, but even under harsh exposures like UV light, acids and high temperatures, the coating maintains its resistance qualities. And Golovin notes, if the coating does become damaged it can be easily and repeatedly repaired, fully restoring the omniphobic properties to their initial state.</p>
<p>Golovin recently received COVID-19 funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to optimize the coating for health care face shields so they stay clean, in partnership with Kelowna-based survivability products manufacturer PRE Labs Inc.</p>
<p>“This technology has many applications, but we are currently focused on providing a solution that will keep our nurses and doctors safe and effective,” says Golovin. “This new coating will prevent droplets or microbes from sticking to a face shield. This makes disinfecting face shields feasible just with water rather than requiring complex disinfectant procedures.”</p>
<p>The original research was recently published in the <em><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.0c06433">ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces</a></em> journal, with funding support from NSERC.</p>
<h3>About UBC's Okanagan campus</h3>
<p>UBC’s Okanagan campus is an innovative hub for research and learning founded in 2005 in partnership with local Indigenous peoples, the Syilx Okanagan Nation, in whose territory the campus resides. As part of UBC—ranked among the world’s top 20 public universities—the Okanagan campus combines a globally recognized UBC education with a tight-knit and entrepreneurial community that welcomes students and faculty from around the world in British Columbia’s stunning Okanagan Valley.</p>

In fact, even for those who managed to maneuver around&nbsp;it back in high school, logarithm still remains largely as an <em>evasive</em> concept. The <strong>“I-can-manipulate-expressions-without-understanding-anything” syndrome</strong>&nbsp;runs rampant when it comes to logarithm.</p><p>Indeed, here in North America, the&nbsp;grade school curriculum has the propensity of overemphasizing the&nbsp;<strong>mechanics</strong>&nbsp;at the expense of&nbsp;<strong>basic theory</strong>, leaving us with the <em>formidable</em> task of filling in the <em>logarithmic</em> knowledge gap, which includes — among others&nbsp;— the theory behind the <strong>properties of logarithm</strong>, and its intended <strong>computational use</strong> in handling&nbsp;numbers with an&nbsp;<strong>order of magnitude</strong> veering towards the extremes.</p><p>So with that in mind, if you think that the time might have finally come to tame this <em>monster</em> we call logarithm, then it would be our pleasure to congratulate your timing on this very honorable act. And if&nbsp;you are simply looking to&nbsp;explore further into the rabbit hole, that would be <em>doubly</em> appreciated as well, for regardless of your motivation, the <strong>taming</strong>/<strong>musing</strong> is on!&nbsp;&nbsp;🙂<span id="more-5976"></span></p><h2 id="review"><span id="Logarithm_%E2%80%94_A_Review"></span><a href="#toc">Logarithm — A Review</a><span></span></h2><h3 id="terms"><span id="Terminology"></span><a href="#toc">Terminology</a><span></span></h3><p>Given a <em>real number</em> $x$, one of the challenges in <strong>elementary algebra</strong> is to express $x$ as a <em>power</em> of another number $b$ (known as the <strong>base</strong>). More specifically, we are interested in finding a&nbsp;number $\Box$ such that:</p><p>\begin{equation*} x = b^\Box \end{equation*}</p><p>As it turns out, this problem — in the <em>crude</em> form that it currently is at least — needs to be patched up first&nbsp;before any meaningful discussion can take place. For example:</p><ul><li>If the base is <em>negative</em>, then its powers need not be necessarily&nbsp;<a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#welldefined"><strong>well-defined</strong></a> (e.g., $\displaystyle (-e)^{\frac{1}{2}}$).</li><li>If the base is $\displaystyle 1$, then any power of it would be just $1$, in which case, it would be <em>impossible</em>&nbsp;for it to generate any&nbsp;number that’s not $1$. A&nbsp;similar remark applies to the case&nbsp;where&nbsp;the base is equal to $0$.</li></ul><p>For these reasons, in the context of <strong>power determination</strong>, it’s customary to require&nbsp;the&nbsp;base $b$ to be a <em>positive</em> number — that is not equal to $1$. While under this assumption, any power of $b$ would necessarily have to be <em>positive</em>, it would also transpire —under this setup — that <em>any</em>&nbsp;positive number can be expressed as a power of $b$ in a <em>unique</em> way. That is, as long as $x$ is <em>positive</em>, there will be a <em>unique</em> number $\Box$ (known as the&nbsp;<strong>exponent</strong>) such that:</p><p>\begin{equation*} x= b^{\Box} \end{equation*}</p><p>in which case, we will simply call $\Box$ the <strong>logarithm</strong> of $x$ (in base $b$). In other words, logarithm is basically what happens when we expressed a number as a <em>power</em>, and then take the <em>exponent</em> from that power —&nbsp;It gives&nbsp;us the <strong>magnitude</strong> of a number, with respect to the base in question.</p><p>For example, when we try to express the number $64$ as a power of $2$, we get that $64= 2^6$. This alone shows that $6$ is the logarithm of $64$ — &nbsp;with respect to the base $2$.</p><p>Notation-wise, the logarithm of $x$ in <strong>base</strong> $b$ is denoted by $\log_b x$, with $x$ also being called&nbsp;the <strong>argument</strong> of the logarithm. When considered as a function, $\log_b x$ is defined on all <em>positive</em> numbers — as long as&nbsp;the base $b$ is <strong>valid</strong> (i.e.,&nbsp;&nbsp;$\displaystyle b&gt;0, b \ne 1$) .</p><p>To begin,&nbsp;we first note that <em>regardless</em> of the value of the base $b$, we always have that:</p><ul><li>$\displaystyle \log_b 1 = 0$ (since $0$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $1$)</li><li>$\displaystyle \log_b b&nbsp;= 1$ (since $1$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $b$)</li><li>$\displaystyle \log_b \frac{1}{b} = -1$ (since $-1$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $\displaystyle \frac{1}{b}$)</li></ul><p>Because these results are almost immediate and sufficiently notable, we’ll simply&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;them as the&nbsp;<strong>trivial logarithmic identities</strong>.</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;since $\log_b x$ stands for the number which&nbsp;<em>exponentiates</em> to $x$, we also have that by definition:</p><p>\begin{align*}b^{\log_b x} &amp; = x \qquad (\text{for all }x&gt;0)\end{align*}</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;we also have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} \log_b (b^x) = x \qquad (\text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}) \end{align*}</p><p>Since one can see by inspection that $x$ is precisely the number which exponentiates to $b^x$.</p><p>For&nbsp;example, since $\displaystyle \log_2 53$ is the number that $2$ needs to raise to yield $53$, we have that $\displaystyle 2^{\log_2 53} =53$. Similarly, since $\displaystyle 10^{-\pi}$ is a power of $10$ with the exponent $-\pi$, we can infer&nbsp;that $\displaystyle \log_{10} \left(10^{-\pi}\right) = -\pi$.</p><h3 id="10"><span id="Common_Logarithm_(Base_10)"></span><a href="#toc">Common Logarithm (Base 10)</a><span></span></h3><p>Being the inverse of the exponential function $\displaystyle 10^x$, the base-$10$ logarithmic function — also known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>common logarithm</strong></a> — is customarily denoted by $\log_{10} x$, $\log x$, or simply $\lg x$ for short. The common logarithm is of great interest to us, primarily&nbsp;due to the prevalence of the&nbsp;<strong>decimal number system</strong> in various cultures around the world.</p><div><p><strong>Caution</strong></p><p>Note that in older scientific texts and some textbooks in higher mathematics, $\log x$ can also refer to — and usually is — the <a href="#e">natural logarithm of base $e$</a>.</p></div><p>When the common logarithm of a number is calculated, the&nbsp;<em>decimal representation</em> of the logarithm is usually split into two parts: the integer component&nbsp;(a.k.a., <strong>characteristic</strong>) and the fractional component&nbsp;(a.k.a., <strong>mantissa</strong>). The characteristic in essence tells us &nbsp;the <strong>number of digits</strong> the original number has, and the mantissa hints at the extent to which this&nbsp;number is close to its next power of $10$. These are the facts that make common logarithm a&nbsp;particularly handy tool in determining the <strong>order of magnitude</strong> of an <em>exceptionally&nbsp;large</em> (or <em>small</em>) number.</p><p>For example, to figure out the magnitude of the number $50!$ (i.e., $50 \times \cdots \times 1$), we proceed to calculate its logarithm, yielding that: \[ \log (50!) \approx 64.483 \] which means that $50! \approx 10^{64.483} =$ $10^{64}10^{0.483} \approx$ $10^{64} \cdot 3.04$, suggesting that $50!$ is a $65$<em>-digit number</em> which starts with $3$ — the <strong>characteristic</strong> $64$ gives away the number of digits, and the <strong>mantissa</strong> $0.483$ reveals&nbsp;the rest about the number itself.</p><p>Take home message? There is no need to&nbsp;write out a number in full to figure out its <em>approximate size</em>!</p><h3 id="2"><span id="Binary_Logarithm_(Base_2)"></span><a href="#toc">Binary Logarithm (Base 2)</a><span></span></h3><p>Being the inverse of the exponential function $2^x$, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_logarithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>binary logarithm</strong></a>&nbsp;function $\log_2 x$ is extensively used in the field of <strong>computer science</strong>, primarily due to the fact that computers store information in <strong>bits</strong> (i.e., digits which takes $0$ or $1$ as possible values).</p><p>Similar to the case in base $10$, binary logarithm can be used to figure out&nbsp;the number of digits&nbsp;of a positive integer&nbsp;in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Counting_in_binary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>binary representation</strong></a>. In addition, binary logarithm is also used to figure out the <em>depth</em> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>binary tree</strong></a>, or even the <em>number of operations</em> required by certain <strong>computer algorithms</strong>&nbsp;(this falls into a topic known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>algorithmic time complexity</strong></a>).</p><p>Beyond&nbsp;the world of computers, binary logarithm is also used in&nbsp;<strong>music theory</strong> to conceptualize the <em>highness</em>&nbsp;of&nbsp;musical notes, based&nbsp;on the fundamental&nbsp;observation&nbsp;that <em>raising</em>&nbsp;a note by an <strong>octave</strong>&nbsp;increases the frequency of the note by&nbsp;<em>twofold</em>. As a result, it is often convenient to conceive a&nbsp;<strong>musical interval</strong>&nbsp;as the binary logarithm of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>frequency ratio</strong></a>.</p><h3 id="e"><span id="Natural_Logarithm_(Base_$e$)"></span><a href="#toc">Natural Logarithm (Base $e$)</a><span></span></h3><p>In some textbooks concerned with a more rigorous development&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>transcendental functions</strong></a>, the base-$\displaystyle e$ logarithmic function — otherwise known as&nbsp;<strong>natural logarithm</strong>, $\log_e x$ or simply $\ln x$ — are sometimes defined as the <em>area</em>&nbsp;between the <strong>reciprocal function</strong>&nbsp;$\frac{1}{x}$ and the x-axis from $1$ to $x$ (hence the term <em>natural</em>).</p><div id="attachment_5991"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5991" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Harmonic-Series.png" alt="Natural Logarithm and the Divergence of the Harmonic Series" width="295" height="230" title="Harmonic Series" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20295%20230'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Harmonic-Series.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-5991">Defined as the area underneath the reciprocal function, the function $\ln x$ increases without bound as $x$ increases, thereby showing that the <strong>Harmonic Series</strong> (i.e., $ \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2}+ \ldots$ ) — whose area is even greater than that of $\ln x$ — diverges to $+ \infty$ as well.</p></div><p>Under this definition, it could be shown that the inverse of $\ln x$ is precisely the <strong>natural&nbsp;exponential function</strong> $e^x$, leading to the&nbsp;following&nbsp;<em>standard</em>&nbsp;definition of&nbsp;natural logarithm:</p><blockquote><h6>Given a positive number $x$,&nbsp;$\ln x$ denotes the number that $e$ needs to be raised, to&nbsp;become $x$.</h6></blockquote><p>Unlike the number $10$ — which is preferred due to the prevalence of&nbsp;<strong>decimal numbering system</strong> — the number $\displaystyle e$ is one of the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/#Constants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special constants</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;pops up surprisingly often in various mathematical discourses —&nbsp;<em>irrespective</em> of the&nbsp;number system being chosen.&nbsp;As a result, mathematicians tend to consider base $e$ as more <em>natural</em> than base $10$ — even though some&nbsp;applied scientists and engineers beg to differ in various occasions…</p><p>Actually, to illustrate the scope of these&nbsp;<em>intellectual biases</em>&nbsp;among the scientific community, here’s an interesting account from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;on the <strong>historical development</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;notations for logarithms:</p><blockquote><h6>Because base 10 logarithms were most useful for computations, engineers generally simply wrote “log(x)” when they meant log<sub>10</sub>(x).

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There was a time when the Internet was a Network of small computers interconnected running different services, mainly web servers, email servers and DNS servers, oh, and FTP cannot be forgetten.</p>

<p>In those days, a network failure or power outage only affected a small portion of the Internet, of course that Internet was small, like really small compared to today's standards.</p>

<p>But then, it came Geocities, and Yahoo, Reddit and of course Google, what happened is that most of us decided that instead of hosting our own services and dealing with all the hassle, just put them in some other's hands.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h2>

<p>At the beginning, the Internet was only visible to engineers and tech people, to the rest of the population was unknown, or just not important at all. When marketeers saw the potential of being on-line a lot of non-technical people in the need to be on-line required professional services to set up their servers and just be on-line, and of course have an email address.</p>

<p>The first dial-up service providers at those days gave you an email address at their domain, and usually your own home folder in their Linux server mapped through Apache to your own web space.</p>

<p>Then, some visionaries saw the potential of business, and Hotmail came to the word. Now if you do not know how to host your email server, you were not tied to your service provider just because they have your email address tied to their domains.</p>

<p>Well, Gmail came too, as Google realized that they can read everybody's email if they offered a free service.</p>

<p>At that moment, a lot of more people was on the Internet, and then the <em>bad guys</em> also realized they can make money there, and started to hack servers, started Phishing and making it hard to host your email server, or your DNS server, just because everybody wanted to hack them and use them to scam others.</p>

<p>We all realized that it was to much of a headache to self-host, and almost everybody started to host on third parties, so much that now we have to use self-host, when <strong>host</strong> should mean <strong>self-host</strong> and the opposite should bit <strong>outsource hosting</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-internet-is-small-again">The Internet is small again</h2>

<p>Yes, we have return to a small Internet, it is big in number of websites, pages, content and all the fiber optic cable linking those servers, actually Data Centers full of servers, full in turn of VPSs or Containers… But small in the number of owners of the infrastructure, even smaller that in the first days.</p>

<p>Facebook, Google, Amazon, Cloudflare and Apple concentrate almost all Internet traffic and hosting services. To the point that some people might think that the Internet is Facebook. Some small companies does not even have a website anymore, they just have Facebook page, they do not publish their email on cards, just their Facebook page, and use Facebook Messenger to get contacted by their customers.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-that-bad">How is that bad</h2>

<p>That is bad in such a variety of ways that this post will not be enough to name them, but let us name a few.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lose of identity</strong>: If you do not <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/own-your-domain.html">own your domain</a>, you can be out of business and any time, when Facebook or whoever your are trusting decide its time for you to go out of business.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: You will have to trust Google, Facebook and others not to "read" your private messages, and you can be sure they are doing exactly that.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cloudflare-outage">Cloudflare Outage</h2>

<p>But what happened yesterday shows us the potential risks. Yesterday one of the biggest provider of the Internet <strong>Cloudflare</strong> had a technical issue, some of their engineers made a mistake and instead of routing traffic away of an overloaded server (router), did just the opposite and sent all traffic to one creating a bottleneck and <em>turning part of the Internet off</em>.</p>

<p>So many companies, some big ones like Discord, Shopify and others use Cloudflare's services that as said, a big portion of Internet was down yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a mistake, an engineer typed the wrong command, and that can will happen again, but what about Google+, and <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">a lot of other services</a>, only on Google's hands.</p>

<h2 id="the-risks">The risks</h2>

<p>We as users are putting are eggs in just some few baskets, even small providers buy services from the big ones to offer their services. Every small to medium service provider is on AWS or Azure or Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Are we ready to be on their hands?, we actually are their hands already, they can squeeze us anytime. We as users should try to diversify the Internet again.</p>

<p>What would happen if one of those big companies once they gain full control decide what should or should not be on the Internet, Google already has that power.</p>

<p>The risks are big, <strong>we may lose our freedom</strong></p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>

<p>What can we do about that?</p>

<p>Well start by owning your domain, try to host your services with small companies instead of the big ones, avoid if you can AWS, Cloudflare, and if you are really brave, try to host your own services, your own DNS, your own email servers.</p>

<p>I know I should start doing that myself, I have some domains at Cloudflare, used to use AWS DNS server too, I have a Gmail accout, and my main email address is hosted at Google but at least using my own domain.</p>

<p>I do host my web servers (on a VPS, because the Internet in my country is not the best), and my social network by hosting my own Mastodon Instance.</p>

<p>Next steps is hosting my email server, and maybe my DNS server, or at least moving it to a smaller provider.</p>

Adorning a long wall are two timelines, one above the other: Beijing in 1989, Hong Kong in 2019, with the two moments matched up beat for beat. A few feet to the left are the self-authored wills of students, trying to explain to their grieving families why they had to risk their lives in Tiananmen Square. And, beside them, similar letters from protestors in Hong Kong, written late last year as tear gas filled the streets, university campuses were besieged, and police violence ran rampant. The overall message is clear: these two revolts should be spoken of in the same breath. </p><p>But over the past few weeks, another Tiananmen parallel has begun to suggest itself—one that you certainly won’t find celebrated in the June 4th Museum. In late June, the Chinese government imposed a National Security Law, which criminalizes “subversion”—carrying pro-independence stickers can mean jail time—and grants China’s notorious security services an open foothold in the city. If Hong Kong’s 2019 was like Beijing’s 1989, what does that mean for the Hong Kong of the 2020s and 2030s? Will Hong Kong, which has long cherished its boisterously free civic culture, come to look like Beijing in the years after the tanks rolled into the square? </p><p>Outside China, history mainly remembers Tiananmen Square for the protestors who were massacred and the intellectuals who spent decades in prison or exile. But most of those who were involved do not fit that description. Instead, gradually and often uncomfortably, hundreds of thousands of protestors slowly made peace with the status quo and found ways to accommodate themselves to the system. “I know for a fact that some of them are multimillionaires,” Tiananmen leader Chen Ziming has <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_People_s_Republic_of_Amnesia/MXVYAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=chen%20ziming">said of his former comrades</a>. “They won’t even admit to having been student leaders.”</p><p>Wang Shi, the founder of one of the world’s largest real estate companies, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/june99/tiananmen5.htm">once told the </a><em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/june99/tiananmen5.htm">Washington Post</a></em> that he was imprisoned for leading an employee march for freedom in 1989. Today, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_People_s_Republic_of_Amnesia/MXVYAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=chen%20ziming">he</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-vanke-chiefs-state-savior-could-be-his-undoing-1469127600">denies</a> that it ever happened. </p><p>Could the same cocktail of terror and self-interest that all but stamped out a nascent liberal moment in China succeed against Hong Kong’s more established civic traditions? The question has global resonance. As nations from Poland to Brazil grapple with whether the institutions of liberal democracy can survive an increasingly illiberal electorate, Hong Kong presents the inverse question: can a society’s liberalism survive a government determined to stamp it out? </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.persuasion.community/p/closing-hong-kong?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/closing-hong-kong?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>For many years, outsiders assumed that Hong Kong would always value economic growth over political freedom. But the 2014 Umbrella protests put this notion to rest. As Joshua Wong, the city’s most famous pro-democracy activist, told me in 2017, during the unsteady détente that followed the protests: “we proved to the world that Hong Kongers are ready for democracy.”</p><p>Last week, I repeated my question to Wong. Would the National Security Law finally push Hong Kong into fulfilling that old stereotype? As a politician in his position must, he remained hopeful. “They are unable to censor away all the memories of Hong Kong’s people in the past few years,” Wong said. In fact, he claimed, Hong Kong’s political resilience is tied to its economic vitality: “With [China’s] economic reliance on Hong Kong, Hong Kong people still have the leverage to fight for a greater degree of autonomy and choose not to kowtow to Beijing.”</p><p>But recent events belie Wong’s optimism. The day the National Security Law was passed, Wong and his allies quickly dismantled Demosistō, the pro-democracy party he led. Scores of activists fled Twitter in fear. Even the usually apolitical investment analysts based in Hong Kong began to wonder whether they might risk a visit from the police if they dared to criticize Chinese companies.</p><p>Most dishearteningly, the past weeks have made it clear that the National Security Law is pulling apart not only Hong Kong’s liberal political institutions, but also the wider constellation of organizations that sustain its civic culture. </p><p>One telling microcosm is the local high school debating scene. Hong Kong’s national team ranks among the best in the world. But that proud tradition may soon be coming to an end: the charity that runs the national team is closing up shop. “There’s no way we can continue under the present environment,” one insider told me. “But we can’t suggest that this is related to the National Security Law because that would bring unwanted attention to some of our teachers. We’re already seeing schools axe their debating programs out of fear, and presumably parents will also start withdrawing their children as the ramifications of the law sink in.”</p><p>Given the circumstances, few can fault parents and teachers for withdrawing students from an activity whose purpose is to discuss controversial topics. But the inevitable result is that Hong Kong’s local debating league, which has taught tens of thousands of schoolchildren to think critically and argue carefully, could soon be no more.</p><p>To better understand the situation in Hong Kong’s schools, I spoke to Raymond Yeung, until this summer a teacher at an elite Hong Kong girls’ school. Yeung was blinded in one eye by the police at a pro-democracy protest last year. Then he lost his job after his school cut back the curriculum for Liberal Studies, a subject designed to teach students civics and critical thinking. </p><p>Yeung’s summary was succinct: “The situation is quite grim.” Even before the National Security Law, pro-establishment groups regularly organized public denunciations of teachers deemed too sympathetic to the protests. Now, the future is even more uncertain. “We really don’t know what will happen in the next school year,” Yeung said. “The government is trying very hard to control the discussion of political issues in schools.” </p><p>Hong Kong’s authorities are currently reviewing the textbooks used to teach Liberal Studies. “Those books that have been reviewed will need to remove much information about the political situation in Hong Kong. We teachers dare not mention these issues anymore.”</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.persuasion.community/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Persuasion&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.persuasion.community/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Persuasion</span></a></p><p>The leitmotif of Hong Kong’s future is becoming clear: spaces for discussion and debate continue to narrow. But the city’s underlying political, cultural and economic grievances remain unchanged. “In the end, the anger is still here,” Yeung stressed. </p><p>Decades of broken Chinese promises and the whiplash of the past twelve months will not be easily forgotten. Perhaps Hong Kong’s unique culture, binding together a powerful sense of Cantonese identity with decades lived under a free press and independent judiciary, will survive the current onslaught. But as those brave students in Tiananmen Square found out in 1989, hopes and hypotheticals offer scant protection against the raw power of the Chinese state.</p><p><strong>Archie Hall is a writer from London and Hong Kong.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="trying-out-the-nix-development-experience">Trying out the Nix development experience</h2>
<p>The other day, while building a <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/shumlak/WARPX/html/index.html">scientific project</a> to which I’m a contributor, I
ran into a nasty version conflict between two system libraries. In a fit of
pique, I decided to learn enough about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> to be able to set up a reproducible,
tightly controlled local build. It’s done now, and overall I’m very happy with
the tooling and setup. I’m using <a href="https://direnv.net/">direnv</a> to tightly integrate my normal shell
with Nix’s <code>nix-shell</code> feature, and for the most part everything feels seamless.
It is extremely refreshing to see <code>cmake</code> report that it has found a plethora of
binaries and libraries, content-hashed and installed in neat little rows under
<code>/nix/store</code>.</p>
<p>I’m using Nix to manage my development environment, but <em>not</em> to build the
project itself. Nix ensures that the project dependencies are installed and
discoverable by the compiler and linker. Building the project is done with
CMake, set up for <code>cmake</code> to find the nix-installed libraries. Nix achieves this
by <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/C#The%5Fcompiler%5Fwrapper">wrapping the C compiler</a> with its own shell script and injecting the paths to
libraries and binaries via environment variables. There’s very little to do to
make <code>cmake</code> just work, beyond declaring that the packages you want are
<code>buildInputs</code>. The first version of my <code>shell.nix</code> file looked like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span># file shell.nix</span>
{ <span>pkgs</span> ? <span>import</span> <span>&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</span> {} }:

<span>pkgs</span>.<span>mkShell</span> {
  <span>buildInputs</span> = <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span>; [
    <span>cmake</span>
    (<span>callPackage</span> <span>nix/petsc.nix</span> {})
    <span>metis</span>
    <span>hdf5</span>
    <span>openmpi</span>
    (<span>python38</span>.<span>withPackages</span> (<span>packages</span>: [ <span>packages</span>.<span>numpy</span> ]))
  ];
}
</code></pre></div><p>Using this setup, I had very little trouble getting the project to build. I had
to <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/nixpkgs-overriding-packages.html">override</a> the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/libraries/science/math/petsc/default.nix">default PETSc derivation</a> to compile with METIS and OpenMPI
support, which was not too hard:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span># file nix/petsc.nix</span>
{ <span>petsc</span> , <span>blas</span> , <span>gfortran</span> , <span>lapack</span> , <span>python</span> , <span>metis</span> , <span>openmpi</span> }:

<span>petsc</span>.<span>overrideAttrs</span> (<span>oldAttrs</span>: <span>rec</span> {
    <span>nativeBuildInputs</span> = [ <span>blas</span> <span>gfortran</span> <span>gfortran</span>.<span>cc</span>.<span>lib</span> <span>lapack</span> <span>python</span> <span>openmpi</span> <span>metis</span> ];
    <span>preConfigure</span> = <span>''
</span><span>        export FC="</span><span>${</span><span>gfortran</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/gfortran" F77="</span><span>${</span><span>gfortran</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/gfortran"
</span><span>        patchShebangs .
</span><span>        configureFlagsArray=(
</span><span>        $configureFlagsArray
</span><span>        "--with-mpi-dir=</span><span>${</span><span>openmpi</span><span>}</span><span>"
</span><span>        "--with-metis=</span><span>${</span><span>metis</span><span>}</span><span>"
</span><span>        "--with-blas-lib=[</span><span>${</span><span>blas</span><span>}</span><span>/lib/libblas.so,</span><span>${</span><span>gfortran</span>.<span>cc</span>.<span>lib</span><span>}</span><span>/lib/libgfortran.a]"
</span><span>        "--with-lapack-lib=[</span><span>${</span><span>lapack</span><span>}</span><span>/lib/liblapack.so,</span><span>${</span><span>gfortran</span>.<span>cc</span>.<span>lib</span><span>}</span><span>/lib/libgfortran.a]"
</span><span>        )
</span><span>    ''</span>;
})
</code></pre></div><p>This Nix file returns a function which is invoked in <code>shell.nix</code> using
<code>callPackage</code> function. <code>petsc.overrideAttrs</code> is a neat way to override the
attributes of a derivation created with <code>stdenv.mkDerivation</code>. Building PETSc
with MPI and METIS support is as simple as passing in a different set of
arguments to the <code>configure</code> script.</p>
<p>Figuring out how to do all of this was fun. I mostly referred to the <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/index.html">Nix
“Pills”</a>, which are a great progression through the Nix tool and language.</p>
<p>With these Nix files, I was able to execute <code>cmake .. &amp;&amp; make</code> successfully.
Getting the project to <em>run</em> was another story. The final binary failed
immediately with a dynamic loading error:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">âžœ bin/warpxm
dyld: Library not loaded: /private/tmp/nix-build-petsc-3.13.2.drv-0/petsc-3.13.2/arch-darwin-c-debug/lib/libpetsc.3.13.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/jack/src/warpxm/build/bin/warpxm
  Reason: image not found
</code></pre></div><p>The binary was trying to load a dynamic lib from one of the temporary directories
that Nix created in the process of building PETSc. Of course this failed: by the
time I invoked <code>bin/warpxm</code>, that directory had been cleaned up. Instead of a
file under <code>/private/tmp</code>, the binary should have linked to the result of the
<code>petsc</code> derivation in the Nix store, under <code>/nix/store</code>. At some point, it
seemed, an environment variable was incorrectly set to this intermediate
directory. To figure out where, I would have to learn a lot more about linking
on OS X than I ever expected.</p>
<h2 id="whither-the-linker">Whither the linker?</h2>
<p>First I checked the compiler and linker flags that are inserted by Nix’s
compiler wrapper. These come in via <code>NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE</code> and <code>NIX_LDFLAGS</code>. When
you’re working with <code>nix-shell</code> and <code>direnv</code>, all of the environment variables
from your derivations are injected into your shell. It’s a simple matter of echoing
them out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">âžœ <span>echo</span> <span>$NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE</span>
... -isystem /nix/store/w23r8kplmfx2xc111cpvmdjwmkwy6ip3-petsc-3.13.2/include ...
âžœ <span>echo</span> <span>$NIX_LDFLAGS</span>
... -L/nix/store/w23r8kplmfx2xc111cpvmdjwmkwy6ip3-petsc-3.13.2/lib ...
</code></pre></div><p>These look fine! Invoking <code>cmake</code> and <code>make</code> in this shell ought to pull in the
correct library.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that this project uses <code>pkg-config</code> to find and pull together
the linked libraries. Frankly, I don’t understand <code>pkg-config</code> very well, but I
do know that in this project it is invoked from inside of <code>cmake</code>. It searches for
libraries according to its own rules, and it runs <em>after</em> Nix has done its
job setting everything up. Therefore, it circumvents the compiler and linker
flags that we just checked.</p>
<p>I happened to have <code>pkg-config</code> installed from before setting up this Nix
environment. Therefore, <code>cmake</code> was able to invoke the system <code>pkg-config</code> from
my user <code>PATH</code>. Perhaps the system version of <code>pkg-config</code> was somehow finding
the wrong library? Indeed, <code>echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> confirmed that it was
searching a directory under my <code>$HOME</code>. I thought it possible that some wires
got crossed while I was adding dependencies to my Nix derivation one at a time:
configuring <code>pkg-config</code> appropriately might help.</p>

<p>I referred once again to the Nix wiki page on C projects, which also has <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/C#pkg-config">a
section</a> on using <code>pkg-config</code>. It seems that including the <code>pkg-config</code>
derivation as a <code>nativeBuildInput</code> will let packages like <code>petsc</code> append their
output paths to the <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable. I did so:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>pkgs</span>.<span>mkShell</span> {
  <span>buildInputs</span> = <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span>; [
    ...
  ];
  <span>nativeBuildInputs</span> = <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span>; [
    <span>pkg-config</span>
  ];
}
</code></pre></div><p>but it didn’t fix the problem. I would have to go deeper and track down where
the bad library was being pulled in.</p>
<p>Digging into the <code>cmake</code> documentation and the project’s <code>.cmake</code> files led me
to insert a trio of print statements:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff">find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_check_modules(PETSC PETSc REQUIRED)

link_directories(${PETSC_LIBRARY_DIRS})
<span>+ message("petsc libraries: ${PETSC_LIBRARIES}")
</span><span>+ message("petsc library dirs: ${PETSC_LIBRARY_DIRS}")
</span><span>+ message("petsc link libraries: ${PETSC_LINK_LIBRARIES}")
</span><span></span>list(APPEND WARPXM_LINK_TARGETS ${PETSC_LIBRARIES})
</code></pre></div><p>These printed out three lines in my <code>cmake</code> output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">petsc libraries: petsc
petsc library dirs: /nix/store/w23r8kplmfx2xc111cpvmdjwmkwy6ip3-petsc-3.13.2/lib
petsc link libraries: /nix/store/w23r8kplmfx2xc111cpvmdjwmkwy6ip3-petsc-3.13.2/lib/libpetsc.dylib
</code></pre></div><p>The second two look good. But the first, just the library name <code>petsc</code>, was a little too
implicit for comfort. It was precisely this variable that was being appended
to the link targets list. At <em>compile</em> time, it would be up to the linker to find
the library <code>petsc</code>, and I wasn’t sure where it would look. Safer to use the
absolute path to the <code>.dylib</code>, like so:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>- list(APPEND WARPXM_LINK_TARGETS ${PETSC_LIBRARIES})
</span><span></span><span>+ list(APPEND WARPXM_LINK_TARGETS ${PETSC_LINK_LIBRARIES})
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Changing the link target to the absolute path eased my mind only for the duration of
the next <code>cmake .. &amp;&amp; make</code> cycle. Surely there was no way the linker could
screw up now. No arcane library search involved, just an absolute path, which
couldn’t possibly be misinterpreted…</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">âžœ bin/warpxm
dyld: Library not loaded: /private/tmp/nix-build-petsc-3.13.2.drv-0/petsc-3.13.2/arch-darwin-c-debug/lib/libpetsc.3.13.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/jack/src/warpxm/build/bin/warpxm
  Reason: image not found
</code></pre></div><p>Damn it!</p>
<h2 id="install-name-and-other-depravities">install_name and other depravities</h2>
<p>At this point I was absolutely flummoxed. With every fix I attempted, I
grepped vainly for the offending <code>/private/tmp</code> path in my build directory, and come up
empty-handed. I tracked down the final, irrevocable link options passed to the
compiler, tucked away in a <code>link.txt</code> file in the build tree. They showed
incontrovertibly that my binary was being linked to the correct library:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">âžœ cat build/src/CMakeFiles/warpxm.dir/link.txt
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/c++     -O3 -DNDEBUG -isysroot ... -L/nix/store/31d3hng4sclxi3sz8g3zi3yqmychj2kg-petsc-3.13.2/lib ...
</code></pre></div><p>I had proved nearly to my satisfaction that CMake was doing the right thing with
this library, and I was completely out of ideas.
Finally, a very lucky google search led me to the <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#sec-darwin">section</a> of the Nix manual
describing issues specific to the Darwin (MacOS) platform. It states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Darwin, libraries are linked using absolute paths, libraries are resolved
by their install_name at link time. Sometimes packages won’t set this
correctly causing the library lookups to fail at runtime. This can be fixed by
adding extra linker flags or by running install_name_tool -id during the
fixupPhase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very matter-of-fact way of stating something that, when I understood
it, flabbergasted me. To the best of my understanding, here’s what happens on
MacOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>My source code has an include directive, <code>include&lt;petsc.h&gt;</code> or something like
that, which creates a binary interface to be satisfied by the linker.</li>
<li>At link time, we pass the list of absolute paths to libraries, and the linker
finds the one that matches the interface.</li>
<li>The linker then saves the <em>install_name</em> of the library it found in the
binary’s load section.</li>
<li>At run time, the binary (actually, the MacOS <code>dyld</code> system) loads the library.
The install_name is all it has, so it looks there.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve certainly gotten some aspect of this wrong, so I would definitely
appreciate hearing from someone who understands it better than me!</p>
<p>In any case, this find pointed me to the concept of the install_name, so I had
something to go on. More searching led to a <a href="http://log.zyxar.com/blog/2012/03/10/install-name-on-os-x/">helpful blog post</a> describing exactly
the issue that I was facing. It also described how to check the install_name of
the library:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/xworld21/OneBoard?sort=semver&amp;style=social" alt="GitHub release"> <a href="https://github.com/xworld21/OneBoard"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/xworld21/OneBoard.svg?style=social" alt="GitHub stars"></a> <a href="https://github.com/xworld21/OneBoard/watchers/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/watchers/xworld21/OneBoard.svg?style=social" alt="GitHub watchers"></a></p>

<p>This is a minimal CSS hack that transforms OneNote Online into a full screen whiteboard with laser pointer. With the “Split Vertically” bookmarklet below, you may also present OneNote as <em>two</em> sliding whiteboards.</p>

<p>The intended use case is to run OneBoard in “Presentation mode”, while you write and annotate your page on another window or another device. See below for additional modes that let you work directly on the page but still maximise the content.</p>

<p><strong>BEWARE:</strong> this is a hack that relies on ids and classes in the HTML delivered by Microsoft. Parts may break at any moment, although hopefully not very often.</p>

<p>Clicking on the bookmark will split the page you are browsing into two vertical copies. You can inspect the source code of the above minified Javascript in <a href="https://github.com/xworld21/OneBoard/SplitVertically.js">SplitVertically.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>After installation, your OneNote pages will appear in Presentation mode. If you want two whiteboards side-by-side, click on the “Split Vertically” bookmark after the notebook is open on the desired page.</p>

<p>To change mode, click on the Stylus button in your browser toolbar, open the OneBoard settings via the gear icon right of “iframe: OneBoard” and select a different mode.</p>

<p>There are four modes that hide different parts of the UI. Presentation mode (the default) changes the cursor into a laser pointer. Presentation and Draw modes hide as many text editing indicators as possible, including the insertion caret, text selections, spelling errors, and note container borders.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Presentation</th>
      <th>Draw</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>OneNote header</td>

      <td>Hidden</td>

      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Before activating Draw or Type mode, you should select the appropriate ribbon by switching to Normal mode first.</p>

<p>There are further options to control other elements of the UI.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Hide navigation panel (default: yes)</dt>
  <dd>Permanently hide the left navigation panel. The panel can also be hidden manually via the "View" ribbon, but it reappears on window resize.</dd>
  <dt>Hide scrollbars (default: yes)</dt>
  <dd>Hide the scrollbars.</dd>
  <dt>Laser pointer size (default: 16px)</dt>
  <dd>Configure the laser pointer size. You may have to disable and reenable OneBoard for the option to take effect.</dd>
  <dt>Prevent horizontal scrolling (default: no)</dt>
  <dd>Prevent horizontal scrolling.<br>
    <strong>Warning.</strong> OneNote will scroll on its own when writing text near a border. This can easily happen by accident when clicking close to the border of the page, as it may create a note container that spans beyond the viewport. You may have trouble scrolling back when this option is enabled.</dd>

                    A key component of gender dysphoria is the distress that comes from one's body and gender identity not matching. This feeling has been associated with decreased insular and prefrontal cortical volumes (of the brain)—the insular cortex is the possible foundation of body awareness.

                    A meta-analysis of 25 trials found the benefits of regular supplementation were greatest among participants who were severely vitamin D deficient to begin with—for whom the risk of respiratory infection went down by 70%. In others, the risk decreased by 25%.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, one of the key discoveries is that it is not always possible that we could measure two physical observables precisely, which is the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>



<p>We might have learned a special case of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle from high school or college physics courses that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. In this case, the two physical observables are position and momentum.</p>



<p>Formally, the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle states that the product of the variances of two arbitrary hermitian operators on a given state is always greater than or equal to one-fourth the square of the expected value of their commutator. In formulas:</p>



<p>where $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1)$ and $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2)$ are using the notations from my previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">post</a>, $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2]$ is called the commutator of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, and $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = \Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \Omega_2 \Omega_1$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show a mathematical proof to Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>We would use the following four theorems and properties to prove Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h4 id="cauchyschwarz-inequality">Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality</h4>

<p>The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $u$ and $v$ of an inner product space it is true that</p>



<p>The proof could be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h4 id="imaginary-part-of-vector-inner-product">Imaginary Part of Vector Inner Product</h4>

<p>The imaginary part of the inner product of all vectors $u$ and $v$, $\text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big)$, could be computed as</p>



<p>Assuming $u = a_1 + b_1 i$ and $v = a_2 + b_2 i$, where $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are real (column) vectors.</p>





<p>It is trivial to see that</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="triangle-inequality">Triangle Inequality</h4>

<p>Let $z$ be any complex number, we have</p>



<p>This should be very straightforward to the people who are familiar with triangles and know the polar coordinate expression of complex numbers. We will skip the formal proof here.</p>

<h4 id="hermitian-property">Hermitian Property</h4>

<p>If A is a hermitian $n$-by-$n$ matrix, then for all $u, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}$. we have</p>



<p>Using the property of hermitian matrix $A^{\dagger} = A$, we simply have</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="proof-to-heisenbergs-general-uncertainty-principle">Proof to Heisenberg’s General Uncertainty Principle</h3>

<p>Because $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega) = \Omega - \langle \Omega \rangle_{\psi} I$ and $\Omega$ is a hermitian operator, therefore $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)$ is also a hermitian operator. Based on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">the definition of variance</a>, using the hermitian property, we further have</p>



<p>We apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the left side of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle,</p>



<p>We further apply the Triangle inequality,</p>



<p>We use the imaginary part of vector inner product,</p>



<p>We use the hermitian property again,</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$ suggests $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 = \Omega_2 \Omega_1$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 | \psi \rangle = \Omega_2 \Omega_1 | \psi \rangle$. This means that the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are the same if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$. Otherwise, if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \neq 0$ the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are not the same. If the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$, Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle suggests that the two physical observables that $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are measuring would have not limit in precision.</p>



<p>In other expressions of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, sometimes we would see the word “simultaneity”. How to understand the simultaneity in Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Given measurement would change the system state, and it is almost impossible to achieve the absolute simultaneity in the time domain, what does the simultaneity mean in this case? Here simultaneity means that the order of measurement $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ do not change the final observation, as we tried hard to make them simultaneous and it is impossible to control the exact order of these two measurements. In short, simultaneity just means $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$.</p>



<p>How to measure the variance of physical observable for a system state, as is shown at the left side of the inequality of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Measurement changes system state in quantum mechanics. We would need to create lots of clones of the system state. Once a system state is measured, it should be discarded and not be used for the measurement for the physical observable anymore. Measurement on the same system state means measurement on system state clones and not the exact system state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It is quite amazing that the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle could be derived in a such simple way. Unfortunately, the my college physics course instructor never showed a proof to this important principle.</p>

<p><em>“Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch”&nbsp;<br></em>&nbsp; – Ben Franklin</p>
<p><em>“Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.”</em>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; – John Adams</p>
<p>Today, I’ll be making the same argument that the founding fathers did; that our conception of democracy is fundamentally flawed and it’s time we overhauled our political system. As we look around the world, at the gridlock in Washington, the failings of the Arab Spring, and the mixed track record of democracy in the developing world, it’s easy to see the problems inherent in democracy.</p>
<p>But I also intend for this discussion to be constructive, with prescriptions for how to fix the problems that currently exist. We’ll be doing so, by critically examining 3 very different forms of crowdsourcing, which have all proved to be extremely successful. Even though democracy is also a form of crowdsourcing, we can then see that the successful ones all share certain common characteristics, which are completely antithetical to our conception of democracy.</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Differential Voting Power</span></em></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Our first example is a company that rose from nowhere to change our world and the way we find information; Google. A brief history: There were numerous companies trying to succeed in the Search Engine marketplace. Lycos, AskJeeves, AltaVista… the list goes on. And yet, sometime in the early 2000s, they all just disappeared and <em>everyone</em> switched to Google. Their search engine was so great, that it simply blew the competition away. When you look into how they implemented this groundbreaking search algorithm solution, one of the main pillars was the PageRank algorithm.</p>
<p>I could write an entire article about the PageRank algorithm but to put it simply, it brought democracy to the internet. It gave every single website the ability to vote on any other website, through the act of linking to it. And Google for its part, crawls through the web everyday, tallies up all the ballots, and posts the winners near the top of their search results. It is in many ways very similar to democracy… with one very important twist. Every website gets a <em>different number of votes</em> based on how credible it is.</p>
<p>To give an example, suppose the Nobel Prize winner Eugene Fama decides tomorrow to start an economics blog. It’s so insightful &amp; interesting, that NYTimes decides to link to it. Suppose that at the same time, Joe Blow, who took a community college class on Economics, also starts an economics blog… and his brother-in-law who works at the Street Sheet links to it as well. We now have 2 blogs, on the same topic, carrying the same keywords, and each having a link from a newspaper. A purely egalitarian search-engine would give them equal visibility. But Google’s knows that NYTimes is a lot more credible than Street Sheet. Hence, it gives NYTimes <em>thousands of ballots more</em> than Street Sheet, and this in turn gives Eugene Fama’s blog a huge well-deserved boost over Joe Blow’s.</p>
<p>Google’s search engine works so well, precisely because it relies on <em>credibility-based differential voting power</em>. Intuitively, it makes perfect sense. In our own lives, we know that some sources of information are much more valuable than others. We give much more weight to the advice of some, and ignore those of others. And yet, this notion is simply heretical in our democracy today. The idea of one-person-one-vote is so ingrained in our political system, that no one even dares to suggest an alternative to it. And yet, when you look at successful forms of crowdsourcing, they are all based on <em>highly differential voting power</em>. One only needs to compare the politicians we have in Congress to the quality of the search results returned by Google, in order to see which works out better.</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Barriers to Contribution</span></em></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We don’t have to go very far to find our next great crowdsourcing example: the world’s greatest store of information, Wikipedia. Like Google, and unlike its predecessor Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia too is built around the idea of crowdsourcing. With less than 100 employees, Wikipedia simply creates a platform on which its users can make contributions. Each user contribution may be incremental, but together, they represent the greatest &amp; most easily accessible store of human knowledge.</p>
<p>Given that Wikipedia relies entirely on user contributions, one might think that users would be given the red carpet &amp; encouraged to contribute in any way possible. In reality though, user contributions (ie, edits), are often ruthlessly re-edited or discarded completely. Anyone can give their 2 cents by hitting the edit button &amp; typing away, but getting it to actually stay there for more than a day is not easy. In order to make any lasting contribution, users are required to <em>research</em> the topic and back up their opinions with <em>supporting evidence</em>. Poorly expressed opinions are simply discarded without even a trace.</p>
<p>Having such <em>barriers to contribution</em> does dissuade some well-informed people from making valuable contributions. However, it also filters out an even greater number of ill-informed people who would otherwise be injecting a great deal of noise. A well-informed person who cares enough about the topic to research it is less likely to be dissuaded by such hurdles, compared to a layperson who simply chances upon the discussion &amp; feels the urge to give his 2 cents. By filtering out noise, such <em>barriers to contribution</em> keep the signal-to-noise ratio high.</p>
<p>Contrast this with our democracy, where there is universal agreement that there should never be a barrier to contribution. Our entire system is designed to make voting as easy &amp; convenient as possible. When Joe Blow walks into the voting booth and is asked to contribute to democracy, he can vote for absolutely anything he wants in a matter of minutes, without ever having to justify his choices with research, evidence or logic. The time investment required to vote is insignificant compared to its profound &amp; long-lasting effects. With <em>barriers to contribution</em> kept intentionally low, it’s hardly surprising that our political system feels much more like a noisy bar than a well oiled machine.</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Specialization of Contribution</span></em></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a change of pace, I‘d like for us to consider another great crowdsourcing example that is centuries old. One that we partake in every single day: The market-based economy. How many of us know how to grow crops? Sew clothes? Build a house? Design a computer chip? Perform open-heart surgery? There isn’t a person alive who can answer yes to all of the above. And yet, we are able to enjoy the fruits of all of these &amp; accomplish some truly miraculous feats as a society. This is only possible through <em>division of labor</em>. At a young age, each of us decides upon a career that we would like to pursue. We then spend a decade or more <em>specializing</em> in that one field. We develop great expertise in an extremely niche field, and then spend the next few decades <em>contributing</em> to society, through that one <em>niche field</em>.</p>
<p>More importantly, we also stay away from the other 99% of fields that we know little about. Engineers don’t go around telling doctors how to do their jobs, and doctors don’t go around offering their opinions on good accounting practices. The market based economy works so miraculously, precisely because each of us contributes to society in one very <em>specialized</em> area, and we allow others to do so as well without getting in their way. Can you imagine how well a BMW would run if it was designed by popular vote? And yet, this is the reality of our democracy today. When we go into the voting booth &amp; are asked to choose between Obama &amp; Romney, we’re expected to evaluate both candidates’ economic policies, national security policies, health care proposals, and numerous other credentials in fields that we know next to nothing about.</p>
<p>When we consider the vast breadth of human knowledge, we are all idiot savants. The market-economy has worked so well by funneling our efforts into those fields where we’re <em>savants</em>. Democracy on the other hand, forces us to make decisions precisely in the fields where we’re <em>idiots</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Differential voting power; Barriers to contribution; Specialization of contribution</em>. All 3 can be found in each of the examples given above. If we look at other forms of successful crowdsourcing, such as financial markets &amp; scientific research, it’s no coincidence that these same characteristics show up there as well. It’s time we had a political system that takes a page out of these great success stories.</p>
<p>Let me end this article, ironically enough, by giving plaudits to democracy. It was truly a brilliant &amp; remarkably insightful idea for the 18th century. It gave birth to the notion of decentralization of power. It created a system of government that derives its power from the people. It leveled the playing field, giving everyone equal treatment &amp; equal opportunity. It gave birth to a political system that was open &amp; accessible to all. It brought crowdsourcing to the field of politics. These were all brilliant ideas for their time, and any new political system we implement should surely hold on to these principles.</p>
<p>However, we have come a long way in the past 300 years, and the cracks in the foundation of democracy are starting to show. Certain aspects that are considered fundamental to democracy, have been shown to severely detract from it. It’s time we overhauled our political system and boldly stepped into the new millenium.</p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Xfce infrastructure in 2020</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>Oh boy, 3 years without any blogpost ! So much things happened in the Xfce world!<br>
First, we finally released <a href="https://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1565568000">Xfce 4.14</a> in August 2019, more than 4 years of effort, a migration to gtk3, and so much new things, but you already know that, and you surely already run it.
We are now working on <a href="https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.16/roadmap">Xfce 4.16</a> , with the hope to release it this year  (yes, in 2020) !<br>
You can read more development news on our <a href="https://blog.xfce.org/">blog</a>.<br>
Some buzzwords: new icons, CSD, drop of gtk2 support, UI revamp, and tons of other stuff.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.alteroot.org/media/images/xfce4-settings-manager-4.15.png"><img src="https://blog.alteroot.org/media/images/xfce4-settings-manager-4.15.png" alt="xfce4-setting-manager 4.15"></a></p>

<p>I want to talk a bit about the infrastructure.<br>
Last year, we had a <a href="https://gandi.net/">Gandi</a> sponsorship for our servers. I started an Ansible repository with all our services (no more -undocumented- local modifications!), and we migrated a big part of our infra to the new servers (docs, www, wiki etc).</p>

<p>Then came the time to think about our development environment. We used the <code>cgit/gitolite/bugzilla</code> triptych, which worked fine for us for more than a decade, but make difficulty to have new contributor (our workflow was…hm, suboptimal).<br>
We tested differents solutions (mainly Gitea and GitLab), and we opted for the famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, already used by multiples open source projects. In the core team we were several to use it at work, so we were in a familiar environment.</p>

<p>For months, a gitlab was running on one of our Gandi instance, to do tests and prepare the transition.</p>

<p>But it was so much work that we never started the real migration. Then came the Covid-19 lockdown. No friends, no bars, lot of free time, so why not spent it on Xfce ?</p>

<p>With Simon (ochosi) and Andre (andreldm), we started to use our own gitlab by opening issues, creating todo, doing merge requests etc related to the migration.<br>
The 1st of May, we finally did <a href="https://simon.shimmerproject.org/2020/04/30/xfce-switches-to-gitlab/">the migration to GitLab</a> ! Woot !</p>

<p>Jason (j4yav), working for Gitlab inc, joined us and proposed to help us for the Gitlab CI/CD setup. At the same time, we got a new (sponsored !) VM from <a href="https://fosshost.org/">FossHost</a> ! Perfect timing, we can now run a dedicated <code>gitlab-runner</code> instance, and we <a href="https://simon.shimmerproject.org/2020/05/10/gitlab-ci-is-up-and-running/">started to use gitlab-ci</a> !</p>

<p>As of July 2020, almost all <code>Xfce</code> components (core, apps, panel plugins) run <code>make distcheck</code> on every merge requests and push to master, thanks to our <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/xfce/xfce-build/tags">xfce-build</a> docker container.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.alteroot.org/media/images/xfce-gitlab-pipelines.png"><img src="https://blog.alteroot.org/media/images/xfce-gitlab-pipelines.png" alt="xfce gitlab-ci pipelines"></a></p>

<p>Now that we have a beautiful <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/">GitLab</a>, merge requests and CI, the only missing part was… the migration from Bugzilla !<br>
I forked and modified <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/infra/bztogl">bztogl</a>, a tool developped and used by Gnome and Freedesktop folks when they migrated away from bugzilla to gitlab in 2018/2019.<br>
Initially, we wanted to migrate all bugzilla issues to gitlab (opened and closed ones). But we had more than 15000 issues ! We decided to only migrate opened issues. We took the opportunity to do a biiig cleanup of old bugs by closing more than 500 of them.</p>

<p>A important condition of the bugzilla migration was to not lose our 15 years of history.<br>
AndreLDM did a huge work by creating <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/andreldm/bzstatic">bzstatic</a>, a tool to snapshot a bugzilla instance and make it a simple static html version : <a href="https://bugzilla.xfce.org/">https://bugzilla.xfce.org</a>.<br>
He open sourced it at <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/andreldm/bzstatic">https://gitlab.xfce.org/andreldm/bzstatic</a> !</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.alteroot.org/media/images/xfce-bugzilla-bzstatic.png"><img src="https://blog.alteroot.org/media/images/xfce-bugzilla-bzstatic.png" alt="xfce bugzillla bzstatic"></a></p>

<p>As a result, we now have a modern developments workflow, fully integrated with gitlab.
We enabled github and gitlab.com auth on our instance (some people requested it), and since 3 months, we’ve seen a surge of new contributors, issues and merge requests ! Really a good news for the Xfce project ! 
We also had a sponsorship from <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a> lately, that we need to set up !</p>

<p>So much things left to do, like update all our documentations for the new workflow, work on <code>Xfce 4.16</code>, get rid of our old release manager app and use gitlab-ci to generate artifacts, simplify our translation workflow and tons of other things !</p>

<p>Enjoy !</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>This is a hands-on course on how to deploy a fully Serverless web app using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS CDK</a>. You will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure **CDK Stacks **to deploy an application from end-to-end</li>
<li>Deploy a <strong>REST API</strong> integrated with <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> for dynamic requests processing</li>
<li>Store data in a fast and cost-effective way with <strong>DynamoDB</strong></li>
<li>Use <strong>DynamoDB streams</strong> as a source for <strong>Lambda</strong> in an event-driven architecture</li>
<li>Ingest and manipulate loads of data streams with <strong>Kinesis Firehose</strong></li>
<li>Deploy and query a <strong>Data Lake</strong> with <strong>Athena</strong>, <strong>S3</strong> and <strong>Glue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong> your entire application health in a single place using <a href="https://dashbird.io/?utm_source=dashbird-blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-cdk&amp;utm_content=tutorial-serverless-website">Dashbird</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the resources declared in this demo application as a starting point to mix and adapt to your own architectures later, which should save you quite some time.</p>
<h2>The App and Architecture</h2>
<p>The demo app is a public blog where anyone can read, publish and like posts. It’s available <a href="https://d1qmte5oc6ndq5.cloudfront.net/">on this link</a>. Go ahead and publish something in the top-left corner (yellow button) and also “like” articles already published. Check out the codebase on <a href="https://github.com/byrro/serverless-website-demo">this repo</a>.</p>
<h3>Frontend</h3>

<h2>What is the AWS CDK</h2>
<p>CDK stands for Cloud Development Kit. Think of it as CloudFormation (CF) in your preferred language (Python, Typescript, C#, etc). Roughly speaking, it works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You declare cloud resources using classes provided by the CDK libraries. Example:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> aws_cdk <span>import</span> aws_s3
my_bucket <span>=</span> aws_s3<span>.</span>Bucket(self, <span>'MyBucket'</span>)
</code></pre></div><ol start="2">
<li>Run <code>cdk deploy</code></li>
<li>CDK translates this to a CloudFormation template and deploy it on AWS for you</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you would like to dig deeper, <a href="https://cdkworkshop.com/">AWS also has a workshop</a> that will get your basics started. I also strongly recommend reading the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html">official CDK documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Advantages using the AWS CDK</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use languages that are more expressive than YAML or JSON, for instance</li>
<li>Less - much less! - verbose than CloudFormation templates</li>
<li>Easier to apply reusability and inheritance principles to infrastructure code</li>
<li>Better integration with IDEs for code completion, IntelliSense, etc</li>
<li>Possible to test your infra code, just as any other software</li>
<li>Portable: since it’s just a wrapper around CF, we can easily port it to JSON or YAML</li>
</ol>
<h2>Disadvantages of using the AWS CDK</h2>
<p>Although released as a stable project by the AWS team, many parts (a lot of the good ones) are still experimental and APIs may change in backwards incompatible ways.</p>
<p>It’s under constant development. During the preparation of this course, I had to upgrade my libraries three times.</p>
<p>Documentation is still lacking at some parts and you will need to look at the CDK code, occasionally, to understand how to declare certain things.</p>
<h2>Deploy it yourself</h2>
<p>Although we have provided an online demo, you can also deploy this app in your own AWS account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repo: <code>git clone git@github.com:byrro/serverless-website-demo.git sls-demo; cd sls-demo</code></li>
<li>Setup your virtual environment: <code>virtualenv -p /urs/bin/python3.8 .env; source .env/bin/activate; pip install -r requirements</code></li>
<li>Specify an AWS account ID: <code>export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=1234567890</code> **</li>
<li>Deploy all three stacks: <code>cdk deploy sls-blog; cdk deploy sls-blog-api; cdk deploy sls-blog-analytical</code></li>
</ol>
<p>** You can also hard code your Account ID in the CDK project, as I’ll show in a minute;</p>
<p>When starting a new project from scratch, you would run <code>cdk init --language [python|typescript|...]</code>. This is not necessary for this demo, since the project is already created.</p>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>Deploying this architecture in the cloud and blindly believing it will work flawlessly is not reasonable. We want to be the first one to know when something is not right to act upon it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In this project, I used <a href="https://dashbird.io/?utm_source=dashbird-blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-cdk&amp;utm_content=tutorial-serverless-website">Dashbird</a> for its ease of use and seamless integration. Instead of having to deploy an agent inside my code, Dashbird plugs into my Stacks <a href="https://dashbird.io/docs/quickstart/setting-up-dashbird/?utm_source=dashbird-blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-cdk&amp;utm_content=tutorial-serverless-website">through a CloudFormation template</a> that I can deploy with the effort of one click. It not only monitors Lambda function errors, but also other resources that we’re using, such as DynamoDB tables. They even suggest <a href="https://dashbird.io/features/insights-engine/?utm_source=dashbird-blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-cdk&amp;utm_content=tutorial-serverless-website">insights for architectural improvements</a> cross-referenced against industry best practices.</p>
<p>Finally, Dashbird offers a free-forever plan. It’s a no-brainer to try it out by <a href="https://dashbird.io/register/?utm_source=dashbird-blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-cdk&amp;utm_content=tutorial-serverless-website">registering for free</a>.</p>
<h2>How a CDK project is structured</h2>
<p>A CDK project creates an “Application”. This app may have one or more “Stacks”. A Stack is a group of cloud resources (Lambda functions, S3 buckets, etc) that are instantiated using CDK classes. It’s also possible to have multiple applications in a single CDK project.</p>
<h3>App Object</h3>
<p>Creating a CDK app is as simple as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run <code>cdk init --language [language]</code>, an initial application with basic boilerplate code is created for you in the project root, under <code>app.py</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next thing we need is an environment, which is composed of an AWS Account ID and Region:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">env <span>=</span> env <span>=</span> core<span>.</span>Environment(
    account<span>=</span><span>1234567890</span>,
    region<span>=</span><span>'us-east-1'</span>,
)
</code></pre></div><p>Declaring an environment is not required (CDK can infer from your AWS credentials), but is a good practice. Most of us work with multiple AWS accounts. It’s easy to mess around with several projects, accounts, credentials. When we explicitly set the environment in the CDK app, it’s locked and prevents mistaken deployments.</p>
<p>Now we declare our stacks:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> my_project.my_project_stack <span>import</span> MyStack

my_stack <span>=</span> MyStack(
    app,
    <span>'my-stack'</span>,
    env<span>=</span>env,
)
</code></pre></div><p>This is how we <em>instantiate</em> our stacks for deployment. In the next section we’ll see how to <em>declare</em> those stacks.</p>
<h3>Stack Object</h3>
<p>The Stack object is where we <em>declare</em> our AWS resources. It inherits from the <code>core.Stack</code> CDK class and accepts a scope - which is our <code>app</code> object - a string identifier and an environment.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>MyStack</span>(core<span>.</span>Stack):
    <span>def</span> __init__(
            self,
            scope: core<span>.</span>Construct,
            id: str,
            env: core<span>.</span>Environment,
            <span>**</span>kwargs,
            ) <span>-&gt;</span> None:
        super()<span>.</span>__init__(scope, id, <span>**</span>kwargs)

        <span># Declare AWS resources here</span>

</code></pre></div><h3>Declaring AWS resources</h3>
<p>To declare AWS resources, we need a specific library for each service. Here’s a list of all <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/python/index.html">Python libraries</a> and their <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/typescript/api/index.html">Typescript</a> counterparts. Other flavors are <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/java/index.html">Java</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/dotnet/api/index.html">.NET</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how a basic REST API would be declared (typing expressions were removed for readability purposes):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> aws_cdk <span>import</span> aws_apigateway, aws_lambda

<span>class</span> <span>MyStack</span>(core<span>.</span>Stack):
    <span>def</span> __init__(self, scope, id, env):
        super()<span>.</span>__init__(scope, id, <span>**</span>kwargs)

        my_lambda <span>=</span> aws_lambda<span>.</span>Function(
            self,
            <span>'MyLambda'</span>,
            runtime<span>=</span>aws_lambda<span>.</span>Runtime<span>.</span>PYTHON_3_8,
            code<span>=</span>aws_lambda<span>.</span>Code<span>.</span>asset(<span>'my_lambda_folder),</span>
            handler<span>=</span><span>'my_lambda.handler'</span>,
        )

        aws_apigateway<span>.</span>LambdaRestApi(
            self,
            <span>'sls-blog-rest-api-gateway'</span>,
            handler<span>=</span>my_lambda,
        )
</code></pre></div><p>We first declare a Lambda function <code>my_lambda</code>. We point its code to the <code>my_lambda_folder</code>. Inside this folder, there should be a <code>my_lambda.py</code> file, containing a function called <code>handler</code>. This handler function should accept Lambda invocations normally (an <code>event</code> and <code>context</code> objects).</p>
<p>Next a <code>LambdaRestApi</code> is declared, using <code>my_lambda</code> as the handler (not to confuse with the Lambda’s handler function). This will create a new API Gateway REST API integrated with <code>my_lambda</code> using an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-integration-types.html"><code>AWS_PROXY</code> integration type</a>. All HTTP requests will be routed to the Lambda function.</p>
<h2>Our Project App &amp; Stacks</h2>
<p><a href="https://d1qmte5oc6ndq5.cloudfront.net/">This project</a> comprises one application with three Stacks. They’re all declared in the <a href="https://github.com/byrro/serverless-website-demo/blob/master/app.py"><code>app.py</code> file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/byrro/serverless-website-demo/blob/master/sls_website/sls_website_stack.py"><code>sls_website_stack.py</code> file</a>.</p>
<p>Below we’ll walk through all Stacks in a high level. I encourage you to inspect the <a href="https://github.com/byrro/serverless-website-demo/blob/master/sls_website/sls_website_stack.py">stacks file</a> to learn how these resources are declared and also integrated. For example: a Kinesis Firehose is created in one Stack and referenced in another to include its name as an environment variable for the Lambda function that will interact with it.</p>
<p>Except for the frontend static Stack - which is small - you will notice that resources are initialized with a <code>None</code> (null) value in the beginning. The reason is that, even though the CDK is generally more succinct than CloudFormation, it can still be lengthy enough to clutter the view of the entire Stack. Having each resource declared first in one line, I can provide a short summary of everything that’s in the Stack and then instantiate the CDK classes in other methods.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>SlsBlogApiStack</span>(core<span>.</span>Stack):
    <span>def</span> __init__(self, scope, id, env, static_stack):
        super()<span>.</span>__init__(scope, id, <span>**</span>kwargs)

        self<span>.</span>static_stack <span>=</span> static_stack

        <span># SQS Queues</span>
        self<span>.</span>queue_ddb_streams_dlq <span>=</span> None  <span># Dead-letter-queue for DDB streams</span>

        <span># DynamoDB Tables</span>
        self<span>.</span>ddb_table_blog <span>=</span> None  <span># Single-table for all blog content</span>

<p>I hardly ever find myself reaching for third party monitoring services these days. I rather use the AWS native observability, monitoring and alerting services. The primary reasons being that I can use my favorite Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to define the infrastructure as well as the monitoring, observability and dashboards for every project in one place. I also only pay for what I use; there are no monthly subscriptions.</p>



<p><em>This blog is also available as a presentation. Reach out if you would like me to present it at an event. It consists of about 30% slides and 70% live demo. </em><br></p>



<p>In this two-part series, we’ll first build a bad microservice system and add observability, monitoring and alerting. The second part will focus on refactoring the code and go into more details on the decisions made.</p>



<p>Like most of my blogs, this one is also accompanied by code. I decided to create three microservices, each in their own repositories, with the fourth one used to reference all of them. The code is available on github: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService" target="_blank">https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService</a>. These microservices were designed poorly for demo purposes and to explain the importance of certain points, like structured logging. Below are all three services:</p>

<p>Within each project you can find an <strong>OpenAPI </strong>(<a href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroServicePerson/blob/master/part1/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">part1/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml</a>) file that defines the API definition for each service.<strong> AWS CDK</strong> is used and they all follow the similar stock standard CDK project layout: Typescript for the CDK and <strong>ES6 JS</strong> for the application code. NPM commands have been written to do deployments and it also contains<strong> end-to-end tests </strong>using Mocha and Chai. In addition, each service contains a detailed README inside the /part1 path. Note that I only have a single Lambda for the API endpoint and do internal routing. Yes, I believe in a <strong>Lambalith for the API</strong> 😊 and also prefer JSON POST over REST (more about this later).</p>



<p>The client service stores clients and has basic <em>create-client</em> and <em>find-client</em> functionalities as well as an endpoint to increment the person count for a specific client. The person service also has basic <em>create-person</em> and <em>find-person</em> endpoints. When a person is created, it calls the common service which notifies me by email about the new person that was added using an SNS subscription. The common service first needs to do a lookup on the client service so that it can enrich the email. It also increments the counter on the client. Click on the image below to see the step-by-step path for creating a person:</p>

<p>In Part 2 we will focus on refactoring and decoupling this system. That brings me to the reason why the current system is poorly designed. I <strong>purposefully created a distributed monolith</strong>.</p>



<p>The create-person call is highly dependent on the common
service and does not even know that the common service is dependent on the
client service. As a result, the person service is also dragged down if either
the common or the client service is down. Not to mention that it now has to
wait for the completion of every step in the synchronous chain. This wastes money
and increases the probability of hitting the API Gateway timeout of 29 seconds.
</p>



<p>Let’s first look at a few generic concepts that are referenced throughout the post. Then we will look at the AWS native services.</p>



<h2>Structured logging, types of errors and metrics</h2>



<h3>Errors</h3>



<p><u>Hard Errors</u> are infrastructure and runtime errors. You should always have alerts on these. Ex. time out, unexpected error and runtime errors not caught by try-catch blocks.</p>



<p><u>Soft Errors</u> are completely software-defined. This is when your infrastructure and services are working but the <strong>result was undesired</strong>. An example would be that your API returned an HTTP status code 200 with a validation error message in the body. </p>



<h3>Metrics</h3>



<p><u>Business Metrics </u>– Key performance indicators (KPIs) that you use to measure your application performance against. Ex. orders placed.</p>



<p><u>Customer Experience Metrics</u> – Percentiles and perceived latencies that the user is experiencing. A typical scenario would be page load times. Another would be that even though your API is fast, the front-end needs to make 10 concurrent API calls when the application starts. The browsers then queues these concurrent requests and the user waits at least two or three times longer.</p>



<p><u>System Metrics</u> – Application level metrics that indicate system health. Ex. number of API requests, queue length, etc. </p>



<h3>Structured logging</h3>



<p>All microservices write logs in the format below. This is done by wrapping around the <em>console </em>class and writing in JSON format. Levels will include all your basics, like info, log, debug, error, warning, with the only new one being audit.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging1.png" alt="" width="737" height="38" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging1.png 737w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging1-300x15.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px"></a></figure>



<p>A single audit record is written per Lambda execution and gives a summary for the result of that execution. The image below shows an audit record that contains the API path, run time, status code, reason and many more fields used in the Log Insight queries later on. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging2.png 522w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging2-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"></a></figure>



<p> The image below shows an unsuccessful execution:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging3.png 506w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_10_StructuredLogging3-300x251.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></a></figure>



<p>Note that the runtime is not the one reported by Lambda.
There is an environment variable on the Lambda itself that indicates what the
function timeout value is. We then subtract the <em>context.getRemainingTimeInMillis()</em>
to get a close estimate to the actual reported runtime.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at the AWS Native services that we will use. </p>



<h2>AWS CloudWatch Logs</h2>



<p>Logs are crucial to any application. CloudWatch stores logs in the format of log groups and log streams. Each log group can be considered a Lambda function and a stream is the executions of that Lambda function. The real magic happens when you do log insights over your structured logs. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_03_CloudWatchLogs.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_03_CloudWatchLogs-1024x402.png" alt="" width="1024" height="402" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_03_CloudWatchLogs-1024x402.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_03_CloudWatchLogs-300x118.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_03_CloudWatchLogs-768x301.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>AWS CloudWatch Metrics</h2>



<p>Metrics are best described as the logging of discrete data points for a system against time. These metrics can then be displayed on graphs, like; database CPU versus time or the types of API response over time. They are at the heart of many services, like dashboards, alerts and auto scaling. If you write a log line in a specific format, called the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Embedded Metric Format (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html" target="_blank">Embedded Metric Format</a>, it automatically transforms it into a metric. Find the client libraries that help write this format <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format_Libraries.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p>



<p>Below shows the amount of API calls summed by 1-minute intervals for the client API after the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="artillery.io (opens in a new tab)" href="https://artillery.io/" target="_blank">artillery.io</a> load test was run. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_04_CloudWatchMetric.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_04_CloudWatchMetric.png" alt="" width="910" height="500" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_04_CloudWatchMetric.png 910w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_04_CloudWatchMetric-300x165.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_04_CloudWatchMetric-768x422.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px"></a></figure>



<h2>AWS CloudWatch Alarms</h2>



<p>Alarms perform an action when certain conditions on Metrics are met. &nbsp;For example, CPU more than 50% for 3 minutes. Actions include emailing a person or sending the message to an SNS topic. This topic can then be subscribed to by other services. We subscribe to this topic with AWS Chatbot to deliver the notifications to a Slack channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm-1024x637.png" alt="" width="1024" height="637" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm-1024x637.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm-300x187.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm-768x478.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm.png 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>It is important to subscribe to both the ALERT and the OKAY actions. Otherwise you will never know if your system stabilized after an alert unless you log into the console and inspect the system. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm2.png" alt="" width="930" height="210" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm2.png 930w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm2-300x68.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm2-768x173.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px"></a></figure>



<p>Composite Alarms are great when you want to string together some sort of logic to give a higher order of alarm/event. For example, you can create an alarm if the database CPU is more than 50% and the API hit count is less than 1000 requests per minute. This will set off an event/alarm informing you that your database might be crunching away at a difficult query and that it might be a result of a person executing a heavy analytical query rather than your application.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm4-1024x259.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm4-1024x259.png" alt="" width="1024" height="259"></a></figure>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm3-1024x593.png" alt="" width="1024" height="593" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm3-1024x593.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm3-300x174.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm3-768x445.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm3.png 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Anomaly detection uses machine learning (random cut forest) to train on up to two weeks of metric data. This creates upper and lower bands around your metric which are defined by standard deviations. Alerts can then be created whenever your metric is outside or within these bands. They are great at monitoring predictable periodic metrics, like API traffic.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm5.png" alt="" width="662" height="936" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm5.png 662w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm5-212x300.png 212w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"></a></figure>



<h2>AWS CloudWatch Metric filters</h2>



<p>CloudWatch Metric filter will <strong>search the Logs for patterns and publish the search results as Metrics</strong>. For example, we can search for the word ‘retry’ in the logs and then publish it as a metric that we can view on a dashboard or <strong>create an alarm from</strong>. </p>



<p>This is <strong>how we count soft errors</strong>, which are errors that don’t crash the Lambda but return an undesired result to the caller. In our example, all the API Lambdas always return HTTP Status code 200. Within the body of the response is our request status code: 2000 – Success, 5000 – Unexpected, 5001 – Handled, 5002 – Validation, 3001 – Auth. Structured logging always writes the audit record in a specific format. We use this to create metrics and then alarms based on those metrics.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm6-1024x730.png" alt="" width="1024" height="730" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm6-1024x730.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm6-300x214.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm6-768x548.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/no_third_monit_05_CloudWatchAlarm6.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>AWS CloudWatch Dashboards</h2>



<p>Dashboards are great to get an overview of the operational status of your system.<strong> In the example services, each one also deploys their own dashboard</strong> to monitor basic metrics of the Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB table. Everything is defined as IaC using the <strong>AWS CDK</strong>.</p>

<p>A manual dashboard can also be created to combine all the services onto one dashboard. I usually tend to make it less granular by just displaying the overall status of each microservice and other useful information. </p>

<p>The dashboard above contains three CloudWatch Log Insight query widgets. We can even write basic markup to create links/buttons, as seen in the bottom right corner. </p>



<h2>AWS CloudWatch Log Insights</h2>



<p>Log Insights enable us to do SQL-like querying over one or more Log Groups. This tool is<strong> extremely powerful</strong> to get insights out of your structured logs. It also has basic grouping functionality that can graph results. For example, we use a single query to <strong>query the audit records of all three microservices</strong> over the last 2 weeks (see below).</p>

			<p>Many web pages these days set <code>font-weight: 300</code> in their stylesheet. With
<a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/">DejaVu Sans</a> as my preferred font, this
results in very thin and light text that is hard to read, because for some
reason the “DejaVu Sans ExtraLight” variant (weight 200) is being used for
weights &lt; 360 (in Chrome; in Firefox up to 399). Let’s investigate why this
happens and what can be done about it.</p>

<p>Here’s what <a href="https://work.lisk.in/img/font-weight-300/test.html">a test page</a> looks like on my

<p>For comparison, and possibly also as a clue as to why web designers use
<code>font-weight: 300</code>, here’s a table of various font-weights of DejaVu Sans on
my system and the default sans-serif font on MacOS Catalina and Android
(unfortunately I don’t have any HiDPI laptop or low-DPI smartphone, so the
comparison might be imprecise/unfair):</p>

<h3 id="macos-font-smoothing-css">MacOS font smoothing, CSS</h3>

<p>In MacOS, <code>font-weight: normal</code> looks almost bold, so web designers who use
MacOS/Safari might use <code>font-weight: 300</code> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23553486">compensate for this, ruining it
for everybody else</a>. :-(</p>

<p>Well, actually not everybody, as some desktop users (e.g. a Fedora Live DVD)
won’t have an extra-light variant of sans serif, so the normal (regular, or
book) variant will be used for all weights. But Android users and desktop
users with DejaVu (used to be default on most Linux distributions, not sure
what’s the current status) and possibly also Windows users are affected.</p>

<p><a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/#turn-off-font-smoothing">Nikita Prokopov suggested that disabling font smoothing in MacOS reduces the
boldness</a>, and my
experiments confirm that. Furthermore, subpixel smoothing
(antialiasing)<sup id="fnref:macos-subpixel"><a href="#fn:macos-subpixel">2</a></sup> comes somewhere in the middle between the
default and no smoothing (on my display).</p>

<p><del>Anyway, we can’t put all the blame on web designers. Matching an extra-light
font with <code>font-weight: 300</code> doesn’t seem to be a good idea, and matching it
with <code>font-weight: 350</code> is just plain silly (and I’d need to use explicit
language to describe my feelings about Firefox using an extra-light font for
<code>font-weight: 399</code>).</del></p>

<p>Actually, we can put all the blame on them, as <code>font-weight: 300</code> has always
(<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#font-weight">even in CSS Level 1</a>) meant
“lighter than normal, even if the only lighter font is weight 100.” Firefox’s
behaviour of selecting an extra-light font for <code>font-weight: 399</code> is in fact
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Fallback_weights">conforming to the most recent draft specification</a>.</p>

<p>MacOS’ somewhat bolder rendering of normal-weight fonts is therefore a
<em>very</em> weak excuse for using <code>font-weight: 300</code>, which literally forces the
browser to not use a normal-weight font (or bolder) unless there is no other
font available.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s finally proceed to <del>fix</del> work around the
problem, since persuading thousands of web developers to fix their websites
doesn’t seem feasible at this point.</p>

<h3 id="linux-fontconfig-css">Linux, fontconfig, CSS</h3>

<p>Font selection and appearance in Linux is
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_configuration">highly</a>
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_configuration/Examples">configurable</a>
via <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html">fontconfig</a>. That is both a curse and a blessing. In this case, it is
quite advantageous.</p>

<p>There are a few handy command-line utilities which make it really easy to test
the configuration. I’ll use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/fc-list">fc-list</a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/fc-match">fc-match</a> here to see what

<p>Apparently fontconfig selects the font with the closest weight requested.
That’s not what <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Fallback_weights">CSS needs</a>, so browsers probably don’t use
fontconfig font patterns and therefore <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/a4h90n/using_fontconfig_to_block_a_problematic_font/">the usual fontconfig ways of avoiding
the extra-light font don’t
work.</a></p>

<p>But wait. Actually, some browsers do. The <a href="https://surf.suckless.org/">surf</a> browser, built using
<a href="https://webkitgtk.org/">WebKitGTK</a>, translates <code>font-weigth: 300</code> to fontconfig weight 50,
<code>font-weight: 200</code> to fontconfig weight 40 and <code>font-weight: 100</code> to
fontconfig weight 0, which is a correct mapping, but it won’t result in
correct behaviour if only font weights 0 and 80 are available, as 80 is closer
to 60, but CSS mandates that 0 is chosen. (To find this out, I used
<code>FC_DEBUG=1 surf</code>.) Indeed, the fontconfig configuration suggested in the link
above is a sufficient workaround for the <a href="https://webkitgtk.org/">WebKitGTK</a> browser:</p>

<p>In a real CSS-conforming browser, this won’t work as fontconfig is
presumably only used to list available fonts, and the font matching algorithm
then runs in the browser engine itself. One might also desperately attempt to
use fontconfig’s <code><span>&lt;match</span> <span>target=</span><span>"scan"</span><span>&gt;</span></code> to lower
the weight of the font to 0 and hope the browser will select the nearer,
normal variant. Or at least I did desperately try that. That won’t work,
either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>CSS still prefers a weight 0 font for <code>font-weight: 300</code> when both weight 0
and weight 400 are available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code><span>&lt;match</span> <span>target=</span><span>"scan"</span><span>&gt;</span></code> needs to be applied
system-wide and fontconfig caches then need to be regenerated using
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/fc-cache">fc-cache</a> by root, as apparently the system-wide caches are preferred.
Therefore it’s also impossible to apply this rule to a web browser only.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is still one option left, fortunately: <code><span>&lt;selectfont&gt;</span></code>, which controls the set of available fonts. Its documentation
is quite high-level and in some aspects downright incorrect, but by reading
<a href="https://github.com/freedesktop/fontconfig/blob/437f03299bd1adc9673cd576072f1657be8fd4e0/src/fccfg.c#L461-L478">the source</a>
we can conclude that it works like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, check if the filename is explicitly accepted by any <code><span>&lt;glob&gt;</span></code>. If it isn’t, then check whether it’s rejected,
and only if it’s not accepted but it is explicitly rejected, skip the font.
Otherwise continue.</p>

    <p>(The documentation claims that <code><span>&lt;glob&gt;</span></code> only
filters directories, but this is fortunately not true.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, similarly, check if the font matches any accept <code><span>&lt;pattern&gt;</span></code> (these may test various font properties). If
not, check reject patterns, and skip the font if rejected and not accepted.
Otherwise continue and allow the font to be used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Order of configuration directives doesn’t matter, it’s just being added to
glob/pattern accept/reject lists as the configuration is read.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>

<p>Fontconfig’s <code><span>&lt;selectfont&gt;</span></code> lets us hide DejaVu
Sans ExtraLight from the browser. If we want to keep the font available for
other applications (if we don’t, then it might be easier to just uninstall
it), let’s create a browser-specific fontconfig conf:</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>~/.config/fontconfig/browser.conf</figcaption>
  <div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;fontconfig&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;include&gt;</span>fonts.conf<span>&lt;/include&gt;</span>

	<span>&lt;!-- disable DejaVu Sans ExtraLight, it tends to match font-weight: 300 --&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;selectfont&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;rejectfont&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;glob&gt;</span>*/DejaVuSans-ExtraLight.ttf<span>&lt;/glob&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;/rejectfont&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;/selectfont&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/fontconfig&gt;</span>

<h2>Don’t bury the lede</h2>



<p>We’re working on a thing to make Firefox start faster! It appears to work! Here’s a video showing off a before (left) and after (right):</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="625" height="352" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/027tOvYZw88?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>

<h2>Improving Firefox Startup Time With The about:home Startup Cache</h2>



<p>For the past year or so, the Firefox Desktop Front-End Performance team has been concentrating on making improvements to browser startup performance.</p>



<p>The launching of an application like Firefox is quite complex. Meticulous profiling of Firefox startup in various conditions has, thankfully, helped reveal a number of opportunities where we can make improvements. We’ve been evaluating and addressing these opportunities, and several have made it into the past few Firefox releases.</p>



<p>This blog post is about one of those improvements that is currently in the later stages of development. I’m going to describe the improvement, and how we went about integrating it.</p>



<p>In a default installation of Firefox, the first (and only) tab that loads is about:home<sup id="rf1-3036"><a href="#fn1-3036" title="This is only true if the user hasn’t just restarted after applying an update, and if they haven’t set a custom home page or configured Firefox to restore their previous session on start." rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The about:home page is actually the same thing that appears when you open a new tab (about:newtab). The fact that they have different addresses allows us to treat their loading differently.</p>



<p>Your about:home might look slightly different from the above — depending on your locale, it may or may not include the Pocket stories.</p>



<p>Do not be fooled by what appears to be a very simple page of images and text. This page is actually quite sophisticated under the hood. It is designed to be customized by the user in the following ways:</p>



<p>Users can</p>



<ul><li>Collapse or expand sections</li><li>Remove sections entirely</li><li>Reorganize the order of their Top Sites by dragging and dropping</li><li>Pin and unpin Top Sites to their positions</li><li>Add their own custom Top Sites with custom thumbnails</li><li>Add or remove search engines from their Top Sites</li><li>Change the number of rows in the Top Sites and Recommended by Pocket sections</li><li>Choose to have the Highlights composed of any of the following:<ul><li>Visited pages</li><li>Recent bookmarks</li><li>Recent downloads</li><li>Pages recently saved to Pocket</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The user can customize these things at any time, and any open copies of the page are expected to reflect those customizations immediately.</p>



<p>There are further complexities beyond user customization. The page is also designed to be easy for our design and engineering teams to experiment with reorganizing the layout and composition of the page so that they can test variations on its layout in the wild.</p>



<p>The about:home page also has special privileges not afforded to normal websites. It can</p>



<ul><li>Save and remove bookmarks</li><li>Add pages to Pocket</li><li>Cause the URL bar to be focused and selected</li><li>Show thumbnails for pages that the user has visited</li><li>Access both high and normal resolution favicons</li><li>Render information about the user’s recent activity (recent page visits, downloads, saves to Pocket, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>So while at first glance, this appears to be a static page of just images and text, rest assured that the page can do much more.</p>



<p>Like the Firefox Developer Tools UI, about:home is written with the help of the React and Redux libraries. This has allowed the about:home development team to create sophisticated, reusable, and composable components that could be easily tested using modern JavaScript testing methods.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this complexity and customizability comes at a cost. The page needs to request a state object from the parent process in order to have the Redux store populated and to have React render it. Essentially, the page is dynamically rendering itself after the markup of the page loads.</p>



<p>Startup is a critical time for an application. The user has expressed a need for their browser, and we have an obligation to serve the user as quickly and efficiently as possible. The user’s time is a resource that we should not squander. Similarly, because so much needs to occur during startup,<sup id="rf2-3036"><a href="#fn2-3036" title="You can think of startup like a traveling circus coming to town. You have to get the trucks and trailers parked, get the tents set up, hook up power, then lighting and sound … it’s a big, complex operation, and we haven’t even shot a clown out of a cannon yet." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> disk reads, disk writes, and CPU time are also considered precious resources. They should only be used if there’s no other choice.</p>



<p>In this case, we believed that the CPU time and disk accesses spent constructing the state object and dynamically rendering the about:home page was competing with all of the other CPU and disk access happening during startup, and this was slowing us down from presenting about:home to the user in a timely way.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, in my mind there are four broad approaches to performance problems once a bottleneck has been identified.</p>



<ul><li>You can widen the bottleneck (make the operations more efficient)</li><li>You can divide the bottleneck (split the work into smaller slices that can be done over a longer period of time with rests in between)</li><li>You can move the bottleneck (defer work until later when it seems that there is less competition for resources, or move it to a different thread)</li><li>You can remove the bottleneck (don’t do the work)</li></ul>



<p>We started by trying to apply the last two approaches, wondering what startup performance would be like if the page did not render itself dynamically, but was instead a static page generated periodically and pulled off of the disk at startup.</p>



<h2>Prototype when possible</h2>



<p>The first step to improving something is finding a way to measure it. Thankfully, we already have a number of logged measurements for startup. One of those measurements gives us the time from process start to rendering the Top Sites section of about:home. This is not a perfect measurement—ideally, we’d measure to the point that the page finally “settles” and stops changing<sup id="rf3-3036"><a href="#fn3-3036" title="<a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637024&quot;>We’re working on something like that</a>" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>—but for this project, this measurement served our purposes.</p>



<p>Before investing a bunch of time into a potential improvement, it’s usually a good idea to try to see if what you’re gaining is worth the development time. It’s not always possible to build a prototype for performance improvements, but in this case it was.</p>



<p>The team quickly threw together a static copy of about:home and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352">hacked together a patch to load that document during startup, rather than dynamically rendering the page</a>. We then tested that page on our reference hardware. As of this writing, it’s been about five months since that test was done, but <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352#c2">according to this comment</a>, the prototype yielded what appears to be an almost 20% win on time from process start to about:home painting Top Sites.</p>



<p>So, with that information, we thought we had a real improvement opportunity here. We decided to proceed with the idea, and began a long arduous search for “the right way to do it.”</p>



<h2>Pre-production</h2>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, about:home is complex. The infrastructure that powers it is complex. Coupled with the fact that no one on the Firefox Front-End Performance team had spent much time studying React and Redux meant that we had a lot of learning to do.</p>



<p>The first step was to get some React and Redux fundamentals under our belt. This meant building some small toy applications and getting familiar with the framework idioms and how things are organized.</p>



<p>With that grounding, the next step was to start reading the code — starting from the entrypoint into the code that powers about:home when the browser starts. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">This was an intense period of study</a> that branched into many different directions. Part of the complexity was because much of the code is asynchronous and launched work on different threads, which introduced some non-determinism. While it is generally good for responsiveness to move work off of the main thread, it can lead to some complex reading and interpretation of the code when more than two threads are involved.</p>



<p>A tool we used during this analysis was the <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/">Firefox Profiler</a>, to get a realistic sense of the order of executions during startup. These profiles helped to inform much of our reading of the code.</p>



<p>This analysis helped us solidify our mental model of how about:home loads. With that model in place, it was much easier to propose practical approaches for introducing a static about:home document into the ecosystem of pre-existing code. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">The Firefox Front-End Performance team documented our findings and recommendations</a> and then presented them to the team that originally built the about:home system to ensure that we were all on the same page and that we hadn’t missed anything critical. They were already aware that we were investigating potential performance improvements, and had very useful feedback for us, as well as historical product decision context that clarified our understanding.</p>



<p>Critically, we presented our recommendation for loading a static about:home page at startup and ensured that there were no upcoming plans for about:home that would break our mental model or render the recommendation no longer valid. Thankfully, it sounded like we were aligned and fine to proceed with our plan.</p>



<p>So what was the plan? We knew that since about:home is quite dynamic and can change over time<sup id="rf4-3036"><a href="#fn4-3036" title="As the user browses, bookmarks and downloads things, their Highlights and Top Sites sections might change. If Pocket is enabled, new stories will also be downloaded periodically." rel="footnote">4</a></sup> we needed a startup cache for about:home that could be periodically updated during the course of a browsing session. We would then load from that cache at startup. Clearly, I’m glossing over some details here, but that was the general plan.</p>



<p>As usual, no plan survives breakfast, and as we started to architect our solution, we identified things we would need to change along the way.</p>



<h2>Development</h2>



<p>We knew that the process that loads about:home would need to be able to read from the about:home startup cache. We also knew that about:home can potentially contain information about what pages the user has visited, and that about:home can do privileged things that normal web pages cannot. It seemed that this project would be a good opportunity to finish a project that was started (and mothballed) a year or so earlier: creating a special privileged content process for about:home. We would load about:home in that process, and add assertions to ensure that privileged actions from about:home could only happen from that content process type<sup id="rf5-3036"><a href="#fn5-3036" title="It’s vitally important that content processes have limited abilities. That way, if they’re ever compromised by a bad actor, there are limits to what damage they can do. The assertions mentioned in this case mean that if a compromised content process tries to “pretend” to be the privileged about content process by sending one of its messages, that the parent process will terminate that content process immediately." rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>



<p>So getting the “privileged about content process”<sup id="rf6-3036"><a href="#fn6-3036" title="Naming is hard." rel="footnote">6</a></sup> fixed up and ready for shipping was the first step.</p>



<p>This also paved the way for …</p></div></div>

<p>This post is about how I booted to bare metal Rust on x86_64.
My goal is to describe my learning path and hopefully get
you interested in things I talk about. I’ll be very happy if you
find this content useful. Note that I’m a beginner and I may be wrong
about many things. If you want to learn more, I’ll put links to many resources.
You can find all the code in my <a href="https://github.com/micouy/gniazdo-os">repo</a>.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this project came from many sources. I think I first
discovered <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial">cfenollosa/os-tutorial</a>.
I also read a few chapters from <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf">Writing a Simple Operating System - from Scratch</a>.
It’s a good introduction to OS dev and related topics. First part
of the tutorial is about bootloaders. To get a grasp of what it’s
all about, I just read every part of the tutorial and tried to write the Assembly
code by myself.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief explanation of the boot process and what you have to do
at each stage. First the CPU thinks it’s an Intel 8086 model from 1970s IIRC. This stage is
called Real Mode. You have ~1MiB of memory and 16-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register">registers</a>
at your disposition. In RM you are very limited. However, at this stage
you can use BIOS routines (or interrupts). They’re like an external library you can use to
print a character on the screen, read from and write to hard disk etc.
You can obviously do these things in other modes but you have to implement it yourself
or do some hacking to use the interrupts.</p>
<p>When you’re done with RM, you can switch to Protected Mode. In PM the address space
is extended (you can access more memory), 32-bit registers are enabled
and addressing works a bit different. To switch to PM,
you have to set up a <a href="http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/view/the-world-of-protected-mode">Descriptor Table</a>
which is a piece of data that tells the CPU
how to interpret addresses, and describes the characteristics of particular
parts of the memory.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: At first I thought that in PM address like <code>ds:ebx</code>
works just like in RM - <code>ds</code> is the segment (in ‘data’ memory if you want
to read/write to it or in ‘code’ memory if you jump to it) and <code>ebx</code>
is the offset in this segment. In reality <code>ds</code> acts like an index
into the descriptor table. Then, the selected descriptor is used
to translate the offset from the segment base (stored in <code>ebx</code>) to a physical address.
You can read more about addressing in PM <a href="http://ece-research.unm.edu/jimp/310/slides/micro_arch2.html">here</a>.
Also check out other stuff on <a href="http://ece-research.unm.edu/jimp/">their website</a>.</p>

<p>The bootloader is a very short piece of code - it’s just 512 bytes long.
I once even ran out of space and had to remove some strings and unnecessary
code. The actual purpose of the bootloader is to load and run some other code.
The book suggested booting to PM and jumping to a 32-bit kernel written in C.
I didn’t really like programming in C and at this point I lost my motivation.</p>
<p>Another time I learned about Philipp Oppermann’s <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/">blog</a>
on OS dev in Rust. I highly recommend it. I got really excited but,
unfortunately for me, Oppermann <del>uses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a>
(a kind of bootloader)</del> relies on <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage"><code>bootimage</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader"><code>bootloader</code></a> crates to create a bootable image so I decided to come back to the tutorial after
finishing my own bootloader. At that time booting to a program written in language
other than Assembly and compiled to a separate file was way beyond my capabilities
so I left the project for a while.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago I got motivated enough to try to boot to a Rust program.
My plan was to switch to Long Mode. Then I could either run a 64-bit kernel
or load a second stage bootloader. Second stage bootloader is not limited
to one sector (can be more than 512 bytes long) and can be 32-bit
or even 64-bit so it has access to a larger address space and can load
arbitrarily large files from disk to memory (as long as you implement it).
Its purpose is to load larger kernels.</p>
<p>The first step was loading my program from hard disk to memory.
I took a naive approach. I compiled the bootloader and my program.
I concatenated both binaries together, one right after the other, to form one file, like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat bootloader.bin hello_rust.bin &gt; img
</code></pre></div><p>I didn’t care if I could actually execute Rust code, I just wanted
to test if I can load it. I added necessary code to my bootloader
and ran the emulator. Unfortunately QEMU just kept restarting.
I’m not sure what went wrong but it didn’t matter since it
was a stupid way to do it. I could just test loading data from the disk on
a much simpler bootloader. I first tried to write it myself but after a while
I just grabbed some code from Stack Overflow and added a simple error message in case
the BIOS routine failed. After a couple of tries I finally managed to create
a two-stage bootloader in a single Assembly program. It worked something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>org</span> <span>0x7c00</span>
first_stage:
    <span>; load second stage.</span>

    <span>; `dl` register specifies which disk to load</span>
    <span>; data from. it is set by the CPU to the same device</span>
    <span>; the bootloader was loaded from.</span>

    <span>; set `es` to 0x7e0 and `bx` to 0x0.</span>
    
    <span>; the routine will load data to `(es &lt;&lt; 4) | bx`</span>
    <span>; or 0x7e00.</span>
    <span>mov</span> ax, <span>0x7e0</span>
    <span>mov</span> es, ax
    <span>mov</span> bx, <span>0x0</span>

    <span>mov</span> al, <span>0x1</span> <span>; # of sectors to read.</span>
    
    <span>push</span> ax <span>; store `al` for later.</span>

    <span>; specify where the data is stored on the disk.</span>
    <span>mov</span> ch, <span>0x0</span> <span>; cylinder.</span>
    <span>mov</span> dh, <span>0x0</span> <span>; head.</span>
    <span>mov</span> cl, <span>0x2</span> <span>; sector right after bootloader.</span>

    <span>; `int 0x13` with `ah` set to 0x2</span>
    <span>; loads data from disk to memory.</span>
    <span>mov</span> ah, <span>0x2</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>0x13</span>

    <span>pop</span> bx <span>; restore `al` to `bl`.</span>

    <span>; check whether the number of sectors read is correct.</span>
    <span>cmp</span> al, bl
    <span>jne</span> error
       
    <span>jmp</span> <span>0x7e00</span> <span>; jump to second stage.</span>

error:
    <span>; print error message, then halt.</span>
    <span>jmp</span> <span>$</span>

<span>; fill the rest of the first sector with zeros.</span>
<span>; it's 510 and not 512 because the last two bytes</span>
<span>; are 0xaa and 0x55 - the 'magic' number.</span>
<span>times</span> <span>510</span><span>-</span>(<span>$</span><span>-</span><span>$$</span>) db <span>0</span>
<span>dw</span> <span>0xaa55</span>

second_stage:
    <span>; do something, then halt.</span>
    <span>jmp</span> <span>$</span>

<span>; padding to fill the rest of the second sector with zeros.</span>
<span>times</span> <span>1024</span><span>-</span>(<span>$</span><span>-</span><span>$$</span>) db <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This way I didn’t have to link multiple files and NASM managed the padding of sectors
for me. The code correctly compiled to a single file which was exactly 1024 bytes long -
two entire sectors.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>align 512</code> instead of <code>times 1024-($-$$)</code> to allow
your code to be arbitrarily large. This could be useful if you wanted to program
the second stage of your bootloader in Assembly.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t assume that the registers are initialized with any particular
value. It took me half an hour or so to realize that I didn’t set some register
correctly in such a simple piece of code. IIRC there are only two things you can
be sure of - that the bootloader will be loaded to 0x7c00 and that the <code>dl</code> register
points to the same device the bootloader has been loaded from.</p>
<hr>

<p>After I managed to load the second sector I wanted to replace the Assembly code
with Rust code. To check whether I could execute it I needed to switch to Long Mode.
That’s because I had some problems with compiling Rust code to 32-bit
and I ended up using the <code>x86_64-unknown-none</code> target triple, just like
in Oppermann’s tutorial.</p>
<p>Long Mode adds a new memory model (paging), and enables the use
of 64-bit instructions and registers. Switching to LM requires setting up paging.
I identity-mapped the first 2 MiB of memory which is enough for now. I think it
can be modified later by my Rust program. I read the following guides on paging:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#Setting_up_the_Paging">https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#Setting_up_the_Paging</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging#Enabling">https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging#Enabling</a></li>
<li><a href="https://intermezzos.github.io/book/first-edition/transitioning-to-long-mode.html">https://intermezzos.github.io/book/first-edition/transitioning-to-long-mode.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ece-research.unm.edu/jimp/310/slides/micro_arch3.html">http://ece-research.unm.edu/jimp/310/slides/micro_arch3.html</a></li>
<li><a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/entering-longmode/">https://os.phil-opp.com/entering-longmode/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also other things you have to do before switching to LM
like checking <code>cpuid</code> instruction support and the highest instruction
op code available.</p>

<p>I figured that to execute Rust code I needed to glue it with
the bootloader to create a single binary. In this step I encountered
a few difficult problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>To work correctly, the bootloader has to be stored in the first 512 bytes of the file.
The last two bytes of this sector have to be 0xaa55.</li>
<li>My Rust code should also be aligned with the sectors and fill up the last sector
entirely. Of course I would fill it with some garbage values but they had to
be there.</li>
<li>The bootloader has to know how long the Rust code is.</li>
<li>Both programs will be loaded at specific locations in the memory
so I have to manage the offsets in addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linker seemed like a tool made for this. I’ve never used a linker before so I just read
<a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_node/ld_toc.html"><code>ld</code>'s documentation</a>.
Unfortunately, I got a bit confused. I didn’t understand how the <code>.</code> operator
worked in linker scripts. I also got something wrong about the <code>AT()</code> instruction.
You can see the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/comments/hhd7uj/linking_bootloader_with_second_stage/">thread</a>
I started on Reddit.</p>
<p>Eventually I came up with such script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plaintext">SECTIONS {
    .boot 0x7c00 : {
        *(.boot.*);
    }

    .hello_rust 0x7e00 : {
        *(.rust.*);
        . = ALIGN(512);
    } = 0xdeadc0de

    SECOND_STAGE_LENGTH = ((. - ADDR(.hello_rust)) &gt;&gt; 9);
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that I put all sections beginning with <code>.boot</code> in the first 512 bytes
and all sections beginning with <code>.rust</code> after 0x7e00. In order to make
it work I have to rename all sections in the ELF file emitted by <code>rustc</code>
so that they all start with a prefix. I do it using <code>objcopy</code>
(in some linkers this option is called <code>--prefix-sections</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">objcopy hello_rust.o hello_rust_prefixed.o --prefix-alloc-sections<span>=</span><span>'.rust'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The there are two tricks in this script. The first one is that I align
the end of the <code>.rust</code> section to the nearest sector boundary with <code>. = ALIGN(512)</code>.
Then I fill the rest with some garbage using <code>= 0xdeadc0de</code>.
The second trick is in the last line. The <code>SECOND_STAGE_LENGTH</code>
variable tells the bootloader how many sectors the second stage occupies.
The size of this section is divided by 512 = 2^9. Since I know
that the end of this section is aligned with the boundaries
of the sectors I can just shift it 9 bits to the right.</p>
<p>These solutions seem a bit hacky. In my understanding the location
of a piece of code in an ELF file (most common target) doesn’t matter. This is not the
case with the bootloader since the code
must be …</p></div></div>

<p>On July 20, 1969, NASA put two astronauts on the Moon. They chose to land the Apollo 11 spacecraft in a plain, not so rocky region called the Sea of Tranquility for primarily engineering simplicity. Nevertheless, the landing site had interesting scientific benefits as well.</p>







<p>When you look up to the Moon, you see several dark regions. These are vast, solidified lava plains sitting on top of huge, deep, ancient craters. The craters formed 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago during a time when large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment">asteroids and comets were bombarding</a> all planets and moons of the solar system. Later on, the Moon’s volcanoes filled those craters with lava which cooled over time to make the region appear as it does today.</p>



<p>Apollo 11’s landing region, the Sea of Tranquility, is one such giant basin formed during the bombardment period, then lava-filled by volcanoes, burying any of the basin’s rocks and mountains. Once the lava solidified, it formed smooth desert-like plains, which are much easier for spacecraft to land on than rocky areas. Though the Apollo landing still had to deal with plenty of impact craters as seen in the image <a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/484">captured by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO). The Moon really is <a href="https://jatan.space/its-craters-all-the-way-down/">cratered all the way down</a>.</p>

And curiously enough, it lacks a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://moonmonday.wordpres.com/2019/06/17/massive-mascons-crashing-spacecrafts-since-1960s/" target="_blank">gravitational high</a> at its center, meaning its not as dense as some other basins on the Moon.</p>



<p>Apollo 11 collected 20 kilograms of rock and soil samples at the landing region and brought them to Earth for detailed studies in laboratories worldwide for decades. Scientists found the soil to be basaltic, which is interesting because that’s the most common rock type on Earth. Apollo 11 samples also contained tiny fragments of rocks thrown off by impacts on the bright, rocky areas nearby. Its composition was found to be in line with the leading theory of <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">how the Moon formed</a>. </p>



<p>Interestingly, rocks collected from smaller craters contained tiny patches of glass. NASA has made the complete science output from the Apollo 11 mission available in their <a href="https://www.history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/as11psr.pdf">science report</a>. You can explore the Apollo 11 landing region in NASA’s <a href="https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu/?extent=23.4401705,0.6561747,23.5066507,0.6893648&amp;proj=16&amp;layers=NrBsFYBoAZIRnpEoAsjYIHYFcA2vIBvAXwF1Siylw4oNEQBmOOR9RHfS870oA">interactive Moon map</a>, just like Google Maps, by clicking the image below.</p>







<p>The Apollo missions forever changed our understanding of the Moon’s origin. Here’s hoping that the renewed global frenzy of going to the Moon sticks around this time, as there are plenty of <a href="https://jatan.space/why-explore-the-moon/">reasons to explore the Moon</a>.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Here's how to set up a paid (or free!) newsletter using <a href="https://my.ghost.org/signup">Ghost</a> at a new custom domain.</p><p>Ghost is an alternative to Substack that allows you to start hosted and then migrate to your <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/concepts/hosting/">own server</a> when desired. It's open source, so it's fully customizable. And it has membership and monetization features included.</p><p>Why not Substack? It's wonderful, but as a centralized service it doesn't offer the same degree of customizability and flexibility. You can however <a href="https://substack.com/signup">get started</a> there a bit more easily, and it has leaderboards and a community.</p><p>Why not Wordpress? It's also wonderful, but it's not as modern as Ghost is. You can however quickly set up on wordpress.com and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org/">migrate</a> to a self-hosted version using wordpress.org, just like Ghost.</p><p>If you follow the instructions in this post, your blog will look something <a href="https://lyra.ghost.io/">like this</a> when done. Note the "subscribe" button in the upper right corner!</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-3.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-3.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-3.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/image-3.png 2148w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="before-we-begin-a-note-on-pseudonymity-and-opsec">Before we begin: a note on pseudonymity and opsec</h2><p>One of the awesome things about Ghost is that it allows you to build an audience and <a href="http://www.marknagelberg.com/notes-on-the-pseudonymous-economy-balaji-srinivasan/">monetize pseudonymously</a> to protect your privacy. Do you want to set up a pseudonymous blog? If so, there are two options for you.</p><ul><li><em>State-level opsec</em>. For <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23789621">maximum opsec</a>, before following the instructions below you want to get a new laptop, a VPN, and a <a href="http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2019/03/prepaid-debit-cards-other-anonymous.html">prepaid debit card</a>. You also want to read this post by <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/">Lopp</a> and this by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/11/12/edward-snowden-explains-how-to-reclaim-your-privacy/">Snowden</a> and do seemingly paranoid things that are beyond the scope of this post.</li><li><em>Crowd-level opsec</em>. Most people don't need <em>quite</em> that level of security yet, unless they are doing <a href="http://archive.is/b01Ta">NSA</a>-level stuff. Just setting up a new email, using a pseudonym on your blog, and configuring private domain registration will guard your privacy against much of the internet at large.</li></ul><p>Note that either way, the people with root access to the services below (Protonmail, Cloudflare, Ghost, Stripe, and optionally GitHub) will have data on you. Still, basic precautions will reduce your attack surface.</p><h2 id="step-1-get-an-email-and-a-domain">Step 1: Get an email and a domain</h2><p>The first step is to get a new email and register a custom domain.</p><ul><li>Get a new <a href="https://mail.protonmail.com/create/new">protonmail.com</a> address.</li><li>Find a new domain using <a href="https://domize.com/">domize.com</a>.</li><li>Get an account at <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up">cloudflare.com</a> and register the domain <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/">directly</a> there, using the protonmail address you just set up for contact info. </li><li>Note that I wrote this up prior to Cloudflare's recent <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1284298908156346368">downtime</a>; feel free to use <a href="https://ghost.org/faq/using-custom-domains/">another registrar</a> if you want, it's not essential to what follows.</li><li>Note also that even though Cloudflare does ask you for information when registering the domain, your registration will be <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/domain-registration/whois-redaction/">redacted</a> by default.</li></ul><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/protonmail-signup-1.png" width="1252" height="2246" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/protonmail-signup-1.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/protonmail-signup-1.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/protonmail-signup-1.png 1252w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/domize-1.png" width="1504" height="1106" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/domize-1.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/domize-1.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/domize-1.png 1504w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/cloudflare-registration-1-1.png" width="1614" height="928" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/cloudflare-registration-1-1.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/cloudflare-registration-1-1.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/cloudflare-registration-1-1.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/cloudflare-registration-1-1.png 1614w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Get a protonmail, use domize to find an available domain, then register it directly at cloudflare.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="step-2-create-a-blog-at-your-domain">Step 2: Create a blog at your domain</h2><p>The next step is to create a blog at ghost.org and map it to a custom domain, as shown below. Note that there are two levels to Ghost:</p><ul><li>There's <code>my.ghost.org/signin</code>, which configures your Ghost account as a whole</li><li>And then there is <code>$name.ghost.io</code>, which is the admin interface to a single blog (we will use <code>example123499.ghost.io</code> in the screenshots below)</li></ul><p>To set up a <a href="https://ghost.org/faq/cloudflare-custom-domain-setup/">custom domain</a> on Ghost, you need to first create a blog at <code><a href="https://my.ghost.org/signup">my.ghost.org/signup</a></code>. &nbsp;Then go to <code><a href="https://my.ghost.org/signin">my.ghost.org/signin</a></code> and <code>dash.cloudflare.com</code> to edit the A records as shown in the screenshots below.</p><p>The official instructions <a href="https://ghost.org/faq/cloudflare-custom-domain-setup/">are here</a> if you need more detail. Once this works, you should find that <code>$name.ghost.io</code> now appears at <code>$name.com</code>. In this example, content from <code>example123499.ghost.io</code> now appears at <code>example123499.com</code>. You now have a blog with a custom domain!</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-1-3.png" width="1866" height="1542" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ghost-1-3.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ghost-1-3.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/ghost-1-3.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-1-3.png 1866w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-2-4.png" width="1674" height="1425" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ghost-2-4.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ghost-2-4.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/ghost-2-4.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-2-4.png 1674w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-3-3.png" width="1672" height="728" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ghost-3-3.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ghost-3-3.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/ghost-3-3.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-3-3.png 1672w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-4-3.png" width="1324" height="2386" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ghost-4-3.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ghost-4-3.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/07/ghost-4-3.png 1324w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Set up your Ghost account, and then have your custom domain point to your Ghost blog.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="step-3-set-up-memberships-and-payments">Step 3: Set up memberships and payments</h2><p>The next step is to turn your blog into a paid newsletter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With the recent announcement at this years WWDC 2020 keynote, Apple unveiled the long awaited iOS14 update. But are we overlooking something huge as product creators?</p><div><p>This year Apple unveiled a new take on their previous Today page widgets and moved them to the homescreen.</p><p>This isn't by any means any huge amount of innovation on Apple's part - Android devices have had widgets for a while now. However, the reason i'm so interested in this improvement is due to the exposure these new widgets get to users homescreens.</p><p>Apps have previously followed a uniform grid layout with very strict design parameters to adhere to. After a while they all look the same - it's hard to make your app stand out from the average person's 60-90 other apps on their smartphone. However, with iOS 14 Widgets you can make your app stand out on users homescreens.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-5e7a155de356-cb51e83d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e5fb94aa7ed262873f66bcf/5f12d805c716620b62a891a7_how-to-use-iphone-ipad-home-screen-widgets-ios-14.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The homescreen is a coveted and highly valuable piece of screen real estate which for the past 14 years has remained somewhat unchanged - until now.</p><p>People check their phone over ~100 times a day - and with various options of widget sizes to select from, you can really make your app stand out on the homescreens of users iPhones.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-7b79a5dc3959-cb51e83d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e5fb94aa7ed262873f66bcf/5f12d5b0710ab9a764561769_Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-18.09.53-1024x640.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Like the great App Store boom in 2008 with the introduction of third party apps, users first got the opportunity to download new apps outside of the native Apple app choices. With limited choice during the early years some apps did incredibly well. </p><p>Having used iOS14 developer beta for the past 3 weeks they currently only feature native Apple widgets to select from - however, from what I have read, Apple will be providing the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/creating-a-widget-extension">SDK for third party access</a>. You can also see third party apps like Nike with a widget showing on the Keynote.</p><p>Being one of a few widgets available from the release date of iOS14 in September 2020 could provide third party apps with an advantage before it becomes the wild west like the App store.</p><p>By providing a widget for your mobile app I would anticipate the following potential improvement to your metrics:</p><ul role="list"><li>Increased engagement with existing users given it's prominence on the homescreen</li><li>Reactivation of previously stagnant users</li><li>Increased retention</li><li>Increased daily usage</li></ul><p>A great example I played around with was Product Hunt. I typically check Product Hunt at least once a day through their mobile app. I'm always looking to find new and interesting tech products - but wouldn't it be convenient to check the days featured products directly from your homescreen? I quickly mocked up a visual UI below.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-5e62bae219f3-cb51e83d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e5fb94aa7ed262873f66bcf/5f12d2d85487affa89289dcf_Image_17-07-2020_at_10.49.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Quick mockup on Figma</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>From here I can swipe down and see the top featured products of the day and view how many upvotes they currently have. I can also select any product and be taken to their featured page directly within the Product Hunt app.</p><p>There are 3 widget sizes developers can take advantage of. 2X2, 2X4 and 4X4. The example above is 2X4. The larger the size the more detailed visualizations you can create - however, having played around with the 4X4 i doubt many people would consider adding more than 1 widget of this size to their homepages due to their sheer size. </p><p>Lastly, I'm really curious to see how third-party widgets integrate with Smart Stacks and some of the clever ways product teams will take advantage of this feature. An example provided by Cnet below provides an early indication to what we can expect:<br>‍</p><blockquote>For example, if you check the weather and then your calendar first thing in the morning, the Smart Stack will likely include both of those apps and automatically show you the forecast followed by your agenda the first time you unlock your iPhone in the morning. Then, if you routinely check your Activity stats after dinner, the stack will show you the Activity widget around that time of day.</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Apple didn't mention anything about what developers will be able to do with widgets, so at this stage, it's unclear if Smart Stacks' context-based shuffling will extend to include software from third parties.</p><p>Are you considering creating a Widget for iOS14? Any interesting Widgets suggestions? Let me know. </p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3> <p>The clothing industry rarely creates dramatically new patterns. It is more lucrative to make small, easy-to-manufacture changes that always use the same basic pattern.</p> <p>There is therefore lots of room to innovate clothing that is more appropriate for contemporary problems, because basic clothing patterns haven’t changed in decades.</p> <p>I made some trousers with unusual pockets, and I think they’re good.</p> <h3 id="pockets-are-either-ugly-or-useless">Pockets are either ugly or useless</h3> <p>Pockets in tight jeans look bad. Putting a modern slab phone, a wallet, and keys into a pair of skinny jeans will leave even the most fashionable figure looking looking like they’re wearing batman’s utility belt as underwear. Even empty, in tight pants a large pocket bag can show through.</p> <p>The alternative, as many women know from first-hand experience, is a pocket too small to put anything in.</p> <p>A wallet in the back pocket can cause back pain and bad posture.</p> <p>Many of us spend most of our time sitting, but all four traditional pockets are totally inaccessible in that position. So we take out our phone, just in case, before we sit down at the restaurant — guaranteeing a distraction.</p> <p>Aesthetics, storage, and access: these are user needs that are currently poorly fulfilled — and that means things are ripe for innovation.</p> <h3 id="a-brief-history">A brief history</h3> <p>If the space is so ripe, why has there been no pocket innovation recently?</p> <p>Women used to have pockets. That “used to” has to count back 150 or even 200 years, and those pockets were often a separate garment, either worn underneath and accessed through a slit in the dress, or worn around the hips overtop, rather than built into the dress directly — but regardless, “it has pockets!” as a joyous surprise is a modern invention. (Men’s pockets were also separate pouches if you go back far enough; but going back the same 150-200 years, they lived in the waistcoat and the mandatory jacket; if breeches had pockets they were behind the falls and so, I suspect, not used as much in public.)</p> <p>The 1880’s brought the 1940s brought the slow arrival of mass production to clothing — not of the textiles, which started much earlier, but of actual clothes. Before this era, clothes were made either at home, or they were made one at a time. (In a quiet resonance with today, this was done in part by women who worked almost entirely from home, only travelling to the workplace to pick up new work and drop off what had been completed).</p> <p>In retrospect, fashions changed mostly decade by decade rather than year by year, but they changed dramatically. The fashionable silhouette of the 1860s looks nothing like the 1880s, or the 1910’s — so different, in fact, that for women the foundation garments were completely unrelated entities: the crinoline of the 1860s is nothing like the bustle of the 1880s. A person who can cut and sew can sew an incredibly wide range of different things; why not play around?</p> <p>But with the advent of mass production in clothes factories, the whole layout of the factory floor was based on specific pattern piecing. Each station makes only a few operations on each garment, and garments flow from one station to the next. To completely change the <em>construction</em> of a garment means a radical overhaul of the whole assembly line.</p> <p>But to simply change the garment’s <em>proportions</em> is <em>easy</em>.</p> <p>And so we live in a world where every spring the morning talk shows invite someone on to say “this year, [culottes, boot-cuts, skinny jeans, flares, cuffs, boyfriend jeans, high waists, low-rise, acid-wash, raw denim] are coming back into fashion, so keep your eye out!” — but the trousers are made from the same basic pieces, constructed in the same ways, with only the measurements changing. They get longer or shorter, looser or tighter, and change color, but they’re not fundamentally <em>different</em>.</p> <p>It’s like a lack-luster procedural generation system. Sure, there are technically millions of possibilities, but somehow you still end up bored after seeing the first 5 or 6.</p> <p>Probably not coincidentally, the advent of mass production is also when women’s silhouettes turned slim, and when all those foundation garments mostly disappeared. Designs that banish structure from the garment and rely entirely on the body beneath are much easier and cheaper to manufacture.</p> <p>And when silhouettes turned slim, women lost pockets. The more body-hugging the clothing, the less room for pockets — or, rather, the more the pocket contents will show unflatteringly. (And as we know, it would be anathema for a women to show unflattering lump for something as silly as practicality, function, or utility.)</p> <p>And even as womenswear adopted men’s workwear styles, women got jeans but not the pockets to go with them. Spandex made it even easier to make mass-produced clothes “fit”, and fit tighter. The unsightly-lump factor wasn’t going away.</p> <p>Even more recently, menswear has returned to an incredibly slim silhouette. Guys in skinny jeans should, by this logic, not have pockets either. But they do.</p> <p>Women get no practicality and men get no grace.</p> <h3 id="what-if-we-redesigned-the-pocket-from-scratch">What if we redesigned the pocket from scratch?</h3> <p>Let’s design a trouser pocket! This process is going to land somewhere between UX and industrial design. I am, sadly, not in charge of a clothes factory, so I am not concerned with the problems of mass-production, but material properties and the construction process do still matter; but I am maybe more willing to make manufacturing sacrifices for usefulness than most industrial designers are able to be.</p> <h3 id="what-do-people-use-pockets-for">What do people use pockets for?</h3> <ul> <li>Storing things; most often phone, then keys, wallet or money-clip, and other small items. At the moment, a mask.</li> <li><em>Verifying</em> stored objects — the hip-slapping dance of making sure you have everything before walking out the door.</li> <li>They must be secure while standing, sitting, running for the bus, etc</li> <li>Things, especially phone, need to go in and out of storage frequently, almost unconsciously.</li> <li>Access to phone while seated in a restaurant; to keys and license while in car</li> <li>Aesthetically, we want a clean, graceful line from hip to ankle even while holding things.</li> </ul> <p>An initial solution can be based on just three questions:</p> <ul> <li>Where can your hands reach?</li> <li>Where is there extra space to put things?</li> <li>Where is there enough support to prevent items swinging around uncomfortably?</li> </ul> <p>These questions form a physical venn diagram, pointing at a pretty small area for investigation:</p> <p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pocket_venn.png" alt="The human body with overlapping regions of reach, space, and support."></p> <p>You can see that current pockets are located completely outside the area where there is potentially space; the hips and butt of modern pants, for both women and men, are closely fitted. If there’s any ease, it starts just above the knees.</p> <p>Conveniently, the point where the vastus lateralis starts to curve back in towards the knee, creating space, is also right around the lowest point your arms can reach without bending over, giving us a well-defined target.</p> <p>So I made a pair of trousers with no pockets at the waist, and a pair of welt pockets at the side seams, right at that point.</p> <p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pants1.jpg" alt="First pair of pants."></p> <h3 id="notes-from-user-testing">Notes from user testing:</h3> <ul> <li>A pocket needs to be big enough for a whole hand, not just phone, to allow for fishing out small items from the very bottom of the pocket-bag.</li> <li>The pocket bag slips down and back if it’s full and the wearer sits down. This is uncomfortable and</li> <li>The pocket mustn’t allow a slick round phone to fall out when sitting, especially when, e.g. jiggling a leg.</li> </ul> <h3 id="revisions">Revisions</h3> <p>Luckily, each of these notes point at simple revision, rather than the need to start again.</p> <ul> <li>Make the pockets wider.</li> <li>Anchor the bottom of the pocket bag to the side seam.</li> <li>Angle the opening so it’s higher in the back — this both makes it easier to slip a phone into the pocket, and makes the pocket “deeper” on the bottom side when sitting or crouching.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pants2.jpg" alt="Second pair of pants."></p> <h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3> <p>These are great. I completely forget my phone and wallet are there — they don’t restrict my movement, they’re completely invisible, and yet they’re easy to access while standing or sitting. There’s no temptation to slouch around with my hands stuffed in my pockets. They’re so straightforwardly better for my needs that I’m now frustrated when my new-pocket pants are dirty and I have to wear trousers with pockets that are just SO twentieth-century. I immediately made a pair of jeans in this pattern, too.</p> <p>Further revision is possible, of course; but while it will be easy to refine this design to suit my personal body and needs more precisely, there’s only so much refinement possible while remaining suitable for a wide range of body types. If you wanted to mass-produce a pocket like this, you’d want to use something like Dreyfuss’ Humanscale data to make sure the placement and size is appropriate for the widest range of people. Luckily, you’d have <em>some</em> additional information in the sizing of the <em>rest</em> of the pants.</p> <h3 id="appendix-sam-have-you-simply-invented-cargo-pants">Appendix: Sam, have you simply invented cargo pants?</h3> <p>No. Cargo pants solve different problems for different people.</p> <p>If cargo pants are appropriate for your daily life, you definitely don’t want or need my side-seam welt pockets; and vice-versa. Cargo pants aren’t office-wear; these dress pants aren’t combat-wear.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>One of the most stunning things about the technology we consume everyday is the degree to which it is built, operated and even funded by its users.</p>



<div><p>The device you’re using to read this post, the software that’s displaying it, the server hosting this content and so much else on the internet are built with open-source code contributed by a global community of developers. Platforms like Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Airbnb all operate around content and products sourced from individuals, not corporations. And increasingly marketplaces like Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, and many other new <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passion Economy</a> platforms enable users to directly fund the products, information, and services that they consume.</p><p>As user participation becomes evermore mainstream and complex, the next step is platforms that are not only built, operated, and funded by users—but <strong><em>owned</em></strong> by users too.</p></div>



<div><p>Ownership, via employee stock option plans, has been a powerful tool for incentivizing talented people to dedicate their skills to building startups in Silicon Valley. While this model has been extremely successful, it hasn’t been accessible to all, constrained by geography and legacy financial infrastructure, among other factors. One result is that the economic interests of the biggest internet platforms are concentrated and often <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poorly aligned with their most valuable contributors</a>, their users. Now, new technologies are shifting work and value distribution to be accessible online, resulting in a new generation of platforms that thrive on contributions from a permissionless and global talent pool.</p><p>Ownership is a powerful motivator for users to contribute to products in deeper ways, be it with ideas, computing resources, code, or community building. This more <a href="https://jessewalden.com/past-present-future-from-co-ops-to-cryptonetworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooperative economic model</a> helps ensure better alignment with users over time, resulting in platforms that can be larger, more resilient, and more innovative.&nbsp; <strong>This is the Ownership Economy, and beyond being a positive social endeavor, the platforms building it are able to leverage the strongest form of market incentives to grow network effects.</strong></p><p>While most prevalent in crypto today, The Ownership Economy is expanding to other areas in tech. To understand why, we can look to recent history and observe how protocol innovations often expose disruptive new models that, when productized, influence broader trends and go on to impact billions.</p></div>



<h4>Identifying Disruptive Models Through Protocol Innovations</h4>



<p>The history of protocol adoption fits a pattern: first, early-adopters use new protocols to do things that were impossible before the new technology empowered them to do so. Very often, this new behavior involves <a href="https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/if-youre-not-breaking-rules-you-re-doing-it-wrong-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-2-of-4-72c68227fe69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking the rules</a>. Then, a winning strategy for founders is to build products that make these new models more accessible to a wider audience.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Consider the early web protocols: IP, HTTP, standards like HTML, then RSS. At first, popular websites used these protocols to create carbon-copies of physical analogues, like newspaper cover pages or classified ads. But as internet adoption went mainstream, users began publishing their own content: independent blogs, podcasts, newsletters and forums paved the way for the user-generated content platforms that dominate publishing today.</p><p>Another example is BitTorrent, <strong>a protocol innovation of packet distribution, but a disruption that underpinned the streaming revolution</strong>. When BitTorrent first became popular, Netflix was still mailing DVDs in the mail. Meanwhile, the peer-to-peer technology enabled consumers to access music, movies, software, and video games instantaneously, as if the files were already on their hard drives. By 2004, BitTorrent comprised one-third of all internet traffic.</p><p><strong>Consumers’ passion for torrenting signaled that they wanted to access the world’s media at their fingertips,</strong> but for many, BitTorrent wasn’t a user-friendly experience; trackers were moving targets, cluttered and difficult to navigate.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>One person who saw an opportunity through the noise was Daniel Ek, founder of Spotify. As CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9CTorrent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">µTorrent</a>, one of the most popular BitTorrent clients, Ek understood that piracy wasn’t about stealing—it was about access. The winning formula was providing access to the world’s music in a clean, well-designed product.</p>



<p>Today, crypto tokens are the latest protocol innovation to expose a disruptive new model. Just as BitTorrent allowed us to exchange packets of information instantly and without an intermediary, crypto tokens let us distribute value in the same way.<strong> <p>The protocol innovation of tokens is akin to <em>packets for value</em>, but the disruption is in the way new software platforms can be built and gain adoption.</p></strong> <span>The breakthrough of early crypto networks is a new model for market-driven networks, where users build, operate and </span><b><i>own</i></b><span> a piece of the products and services that they use everyday.</span></p>



<h4>The Ownership Economy, Pioneered by Crypto</h4>



<div><p><strong>The idea of user ownership is at the core of the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the first user-owned and operated networks at scale.</strong> Bitcoin arrived in 2009, the year that marked a rapid acceleration of economic inequality and the role of the internet in people’s daily lives. Bitcoin promised a new economic means to participate in modern technology history, simply by running open-source software on your computer. Rather than needing to live in a specific place and pursue a specific career in order to reap the benefits of the new economy, anyone with an internet connection could participate by “mining” or securing the network. In return, they earned newly minted Bitcoin, an ownership stake in the network itself.</p><p>Ethereum’s 2015 launch expanded the type of computation possible on blockchain networks, enabling a broader range of applications and allowing developers to experiment with new ways of expressing ownership in code. The best-designed Ethereum-based applications leverage a <a href="https://jessewalden.com/cryptos-business-model-is-familiar-what-isnt-is-who-benefits-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business model similar to traditional Web 2.0 marketplaces</a>, but encode them in autonomous “smart contracts” run by Ethereum’s network of miners. This means these applications have no central operator. <strong>Rather than a platform’s inner circle of founders and investors taking home the value, users are able to earn the majority of value generated from their collective contributions.&nbsp;</strong></p></div>



<p>Needless to say, one of the most challenging problems any startup or new technology faces is adoption, especially where network effects are necessary—and even more-so when competing against the existing network effects of today’s dominant platforms. As the early Bitcoin and Ethereum communities came to realize, ownership is a tool to help surmount this problem. Those early communities were largely composed of technologists, developers, and enthusiasts who were naturally among the first to recognize the power of tokens as direct economic incentives. But today, founders are bringing the idea of ownership —&nbsp; or at least, better economic alignment between platforms and participants — to new verticals in tech, from developer infrastructure, to financial services, and from consumer marketplaces to social.</p>



<h4>How next-generation platforms are driving an ownership economy</h4>



<p>The ownership economy doesn’t always mean a literal distribution of tokens, stock options, or equity. It also doesn’t necessarily mean that an application or service is entirely built on a blockchain. Rather, it means that ownership —&nbsp;which may manifest in the form of novel economic rewards, platform governance, or new forms of social capital —&nbsp;can be a new keystone of user experiences, with plenty of design space to explore.</p>



<p>Some examples: In payments, <a href="http://celo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celo</a> is making digital dollars and financial applications accessible to anyone with an internet connection via a blockchain network that, like Bitcoin, is entirely user owned and operated. In finance, startups like <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/bnb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://numer.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerai</a> have leveraged tokens to distribute revenue from the platform directly to their users, fueling brand loyalty and growth. <a href="http://compound.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a>, a money market, recently completed its journey of <a href="https://jessewalden.com/progressive-decentralization-a-playbook-for-building-crypto-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive decentralization</a> to become <a href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-community-ownership-ee0ed1252cc3?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a community owned</a> marketplace for borrowing and lending.</p>



<p><a href="http://uniswap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniswap</a>, a crypto exchange, has a business model similar to Coinbase or Binance in that it imposes a fee on transactions. But rather than the company capturing that fee, it’s instead distributed to the market-making traders that provide liquidity and make the product useful. Since Uniswap is open source and user-owned, third-party developers can have confidence building on the platform and a rich ecosystem of integrations has grown around the project.</p>



<p>In social, Reddit recently announced that 300 million users will have access to tokenized <a href="https://www.reddit.com/community-points/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=FortNiteBR&amp;utm_content=t3_gj8tm1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community currencies</a> through their mobile app. The platform will reward participants in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/gj8tm1/introducing_rfortnitebr_bricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/FortniteBR</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=r%2FCryptocurrency+moons&amp;oq=r%2FCryptocurrency+moons&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i58.880j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/Cryptocurrency</a> subreddits with tokens that can be used to pay for membership, tipping, and badges in the Reddit app, giving them ownership over the economy of each subreddit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<article id="post-101">

	

	
	<div>
		
<p>When I started my first semester in university the first course, we had was called <em>Elementary Computer Architecture. </em>As computer-engineers we had to know the elementary functions of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and memory. One could argue then that as a programmer you <strong>must</strong> know low level computer architecture.</p>



<p>When I started to program in my early teen days, I did not know anything about computers. I just knew that a computer had a processor, graphics card and memory. And an on-button. As I developed my skills, the more I learned about computers. I started to examine the theory behind the code. Instead of just treating the computer as a black box, I began to learn the fundamentals of computers.</p>



<p>You could argue that learning the very basics of computers is not necessary for the common programmer. I myself proved that you could learn to program without knowing the basics.</p>



<h5>It is a difference between being able to program and to be able to program…</h5>



<p>What do I mean with this cryptical words? In my late teen’s I began to work on my biggest project to date, a compiler. Before I started building, I had encountered <em>cache misses </em>and <em>assembly optimization </em>but did not give it much thought. My only goal with creating my own programming language was to learn about <strong>everything.</strong></p>



<p>I recently wrote an article about copy-pasting and using unnecessary libraries when you could do it yourself. Without going too much into technical stuff, there is a common “library” or “backend” that you could use. I decided to learn, so I did not use the framework.</p>



<p>What I want to address is that, learning about compilers I began to optimize my regular code, I became more aware of my code. There is a difference between being able to program and be able to program. With this I mean that you could be a programmer, a good programmer, without being able to optimize your structures and think about pointer arithmetic and assembly optimization. But if you know how the compiler that compiles down to machine code, you can optimize and become a more aware programmer.</p>



<h5>Languages like Python are so high level that you do not have to care about low-level programming</h5>



<p>More high-level languages like Python does not give you the opportunity with low-level optimizations like <em>Assembly </em>or <em>C </em>gives you. If you really cannot do anything low-level then why do you have to learn how computers know? You can do just about anything in Python without ever worrying about compiler optimizations.</p>



<h5>Some final words</h5>



<p>Some may say, also I, that you do not have to know about the internal data bus of the processor to know how to code. Is it helpful to learn about cache-misses? Yes, if you want to learn high performance parallel computing, it is a must. But if you are comfortable with your language or have a perfect job, do not worry to much. But I can promise that you will improve as a programmer and engineer if you know computer architecture. So, my final words will be that you really do not have to know much about internal compiler stuff if you work in high level languages. But if you are interested in high speed computing then knowledge of computer architecture is a must!</p>



<p>Before parting I want to <strong>know what you think</strong>. Write in the comment section your opinion. <strong>Should you care about architecture or not</strong>? And do not forget to <strong>like </strong>and <strong>subscribe</strong> for more content!</p>

							<p>Information about more than a thousand staff and members of the European Parliament has been exposed in what a key lawmaker called a "major data breach."</p>
<p>The data includes 1,200 accounts of elected officials and staff, along with another 15,000 other accounts of EU affairs professionals, Marcel Kolaja, the Parliament's vice president for IT policy, confirmed to POLITICO on Saturday.</p>
<p>The exposed information — “a huge amount of data” — includes sensitive information and encrypted passwords, he added.</p>
<p>It comes from a system that had been run under the European Parliament’s official "europarl.eu" domain, Kolaja said, but the data had not been hosted by the institution itself.</p>
<p>“The system in question is a system run by one particular political group and it was data by that political group," Kolaja said, "and they were immediately made aware of that incident.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“This data has been online for some time now” <em>— Yash Kadakia, founder of Indian cybersecurity company Shadowmap</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Kolaja declined to say which political group was affected. But information seen by POLITICO about the affected server suggested that it is the European People’s Party (EPP), the largest political faction in the Parliament.</p>
<p>EPP group spokesperson Pedro López de Pablo confirmed in an email that a database containing email addresses and passwords had been exposed.</p>
<p>However, he added, that database was outdated and only contained information "used by the people who [were] subscribed to our old website back in 2018." That website is no longer in use after the group launched a new website in January 2019, López de Pablo said.</p>
<p>Both the EPP's "servers and the current database have not been exposed," López de Pablo wrote.</p>
<p>"Even in the case that the people who were subscribed to our website in 2018 used the same password that they had in their e-mails at that time, nothing can happen to them now because in the Parliament the system forces you to change completely your password every three months," he added.</p>
<p>He added that the EPP was "currently verifying the list of emails to inform all the people, following [European data protection] rules."</p>
<h3>'This is serious'</h3>
<p>The security breach was <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/119283" target="_blank">first revealed Friday by Indian cybersecurity company Shadowmap</a>, whose founder Yash Kadakia told POLITICO that it had discovered files containing data like passwords, job descriptions and other personal information via an internet portal that’s part of the Parliament’s domain and used by its officials.</p>
<p>The unprotected data also includes information of thousands of people with links to political parties and institutions, including members of EU agencies and authorities like law enforcement agency Europol, the European Data Protection Supervisor, border agency Frontex and others, Kadakia said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, said in an email on Saturday that “a large number of users [were] affected, including some users from the Commission."</p>
<p>Kadakia flagged the issue to the Parliament’s Computer Emergency Response Team on Friday. His company found the data when scanning the internet for unprotected and leaked datasets, which it does as part of its cybersecurity services. “We end up picking up data that is lost to other people sometimes,” Kadakia said.</p>
<p>The risk, he said, was that the data had been found by hackers and could be used to access other websites and sensitive services.</p>
<p>“This data has been online for some time now,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m assuming some subset of members of the European Parliament have used the same passwords,” he said. “If you’re able to access a whole bunch of systems, a whole bunch of information, as an attacker you can really get in there.”</p>

<p>By noon on Saturday, all affected data appeared to have been taken offline.</p>
<p>Parliament Vice President Kolaja, a trained software engineer, warned, "This is serious."</p>
<p>Although the passwords leaked in the data breach had been encrypted using a technique known as “hashing,” which means that intruders cannot instantly use them to access other information, “with further cryptoanalysis of the data, it could definitely be abused,” he added.</p>
<p>“Given that we’re speaking about tons of data, it definitely now needs to be investigated if there was any breach of law,” he said.</p>

Everything you need to know about Tinkerbell and its major component microservices.</p><h2 id="what-is-tinkerbell">What is Tinkerbell?</h2><p>Tinkerbell is an open-source, bare metal provisioning engine, built and maintained by the team at Packet.</p><ul><li>Interested in collaborating? Join our growing community of <a href="https://tinkerbell.org/contributors">Contributors</a> on <a href="https://github.com/tinkerbell">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://slack.packet.com/">Slack</a></li></ul><h2 id="whats-powering-tinkerbell">What’s Powering Tinkerbell?</h2><p>The Tinkerbell stack consists of five microservices, or components:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/tinkerbell/boots"><strong>Boots</strong></a> - Boots is Tinkerbell’s DHCP server. It handles DHCP requests, hands out IPs, and serves up iPXE. It uses the Tinkerbell client to pull and push hardware data. It only responds to a predefined set of MAC addresses so it can be deployed in an existing network without interfering with existing DHCP infrastructure.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/tinkerbell/hegel"><strong>Hegel</strong></a> - Hegel is the metadata service used by Tinkerbell and OSIE. It collects data from both and transforms it into a JSON format to be consumed as metadata.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/tinkerbell/osie"><strong>OSIE</strong></a> - OSIE is an in-memory installation environment for bare metal. It installs operating systems and handles deprovisioning.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/tinkerbell/pbnj"><strong>PBnJ</strong></a> - PBnJ is a microservice that can communicate with baseboard management controllers (BMCs) to control power and boot settings.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink"><strong>Tink</strong></a> - Tink is the Tinkerbell server and CLI. It communicates over gRPC, and is responsible for processing workflows. The CLI is used to create workflows and their building blocks, templates and hardware data.</p></li></ul><p>In addition to the microservices, there are three pieces of infrastructure:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></a> - Tinkerbell uses PostgreSQL as its data store. PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system, and it stores Tinkerbell’s hardware data, templates, and workflows.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry"><strong>Image Repository</strong></a> - Tinkerbell uses a local image repository to store all of the action images used in a workflow. This is particularly useful for secure environments that don’t have access to the internet. You can also choose to use <a href="https://quay.io/">Quay</a> or <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> as the repository if your environment does have internet access.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/"><strong>NGINX</strong></a> - NGINX is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Tinkerbell uses NGINX to serve the required boot files during workflow execution.</p></li></ul><h2 id="first-steps">First Steps</h2><p>New to Tinkerbell or bare metal provisioning? This is a great place to start!</p><ul><li>Getting Started - Set up Tinkerbell <a href="https://tinkerbell.org/setup/local-with-vagrant/">locally with vagrant</a> or on <a href="https://tinkerbell.org/setup/packet-with-terraform/">Packet with Terraform</a>.</li><li>Run <a href="https://tinkerbell.org/examples/hello-world/">hello world</a> to see Tinkerbell in action.​</li></ul><h2 id="get-help">Get Help</h2><p>Need a little help getting started?

<p>Abstract base classes and interfaces are entities that are similar in purpose and meaning. Both the first and second are a peculiar way of documenting the code and help to limit (decouple) the interaction of individual abstractions in the program (classes).</p>

<p>Python is a very flexible language. One facet of this flexibility is the possibilities provided by metaprogramming. And although abstract classes and interfaces are not represented in the core of the language, the former were implemented in the standard abc module, and the latter in the Zope project (the zope.interfaces module).</p>

<p>It makes no sense to use both at the same time, and therefore each programmer must determine for himself which tool to use when designing applications.</p>


<h2 id="abstract-base-classes-abc">Abstract base classes (abc)</h2>

<p>Starting from version 2.6 of the language, the <code>abc</code> module is included in the standard library, which adds abstract base classes (hereinafter ABC) to the language.</p>

<p>ABC allows you to define a class, indicating which methods or properties must be overridden in inherited classes:</p>

<pre><code>from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod, abstractproperty
class Movable():
    __metaclass __ = ABCMeta

    @abstractmethod
    def move():
    """Move object"""
    
    @abstractproperty
    def speed():
    """Object speed"""
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, if we want to use an object with the ability to move and a certain speed in the code, then we should use the <code>Movable</code> class as one of the base classes.</p>

<p>The presence of the necessary methods and attributes of the object is now guaranteed by the presence of <code>abstractmethod</code> and <code>abstractproperty</code>.</p>

<pre><code>class Car(Movable):
    def __init__:
        self.speed = 10
        self.x = 0

    def move(self):
        self.c += self.speed
        def speed(self):
            return self.speed
    
assert issubclass (Car, Movable)
assert ininstance (Car(), Movable)
</code></pre>

<p>It can be seen that the concept of ABC fits well into the class inheritance hierarchy, it is easy to use them, and the implementation, if you look into the source code of the abc module, is very simple. Abstract classes are used in the standard collections and number modules, defining the methods of custom
inherited classes necessary for definition.</p>

<p>Details and considerations for using ABC can be found in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/">PEP-3119</a>.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces-zope-interfaces">Interfaces (zope.interfaces)</h2>

<p>The Zope Toolkit (ZTK) is a set of libraries intended for reuse by projects to develop web applications or web frameworks. It is developed by the contributors of the Zope Foundation. The zope framework has evolved into a set of almost independent components. The glue that holds the components together is the interfaces and the adapters based on them.</p>

<p>The zope.interfaces module is the result of this work.</p>

<p>In the simplest case, using interfaces is similar to ABC:</p>

<pre><code>import zope.interface

class IVehicle(zope.interface.Interface):
    """Any moving thing"""
    speed = zope.interface.Attribute("""Movement speed""")
    def move():
        """Make a single step"""
    
class Car(object):
    zope.interface.implements (IVehicle)

    def __init__:
        self.speed = 1
        self.location = 1

    def move (self):
        self.location = self.speed * 1
        print("moved!")
    
assert IVehicle.implementedBy (Car)
assert IVehicle.providedBy (Car ())
</code></pre>

<p>The interface declaratively shows what attributes and methods the object should have. Moreover, the class implements the interface, and the object of the class provides. You should pay attention to the difference between these concepts!</p>

<p>“Implementing” an interface means that only the “produced” entity will have the required properties; and “providing” an interface speaks of the specific capabilities of the entity being evaluated. Accordingly, in Python, classes, by the way, can both implement and provide an interface.</p>

<p>In fact, the implementation declaration (IVehicle) is a convention; just a promise that a given class and its objects behave that way. No real checks will be made.</p>

<pre><code>class IVehicle (zope.interface.Interface):
    """Any moving thing"""
    speed = zope.interface.Attribute("""Movement speed""")

    def move():
        """Make a single step"""

class Car(object):
    zope.interface.implements(IVehicle)

assert IVehicle.implementedBy(Car)
assert IVehicle.providedBy(Car())
</code></pre>

<p>The component architecture of Zope includes another important concept - adapters. Generally speaking, this is a simple design pattern that corrects one class for use somewhere where a different set of methods and attributes is required.</p>

<h2 id="adapters">Adapters</h2>

<p>Consider a simple an example from the <a href="https://bluebream.zope.org/doc/1.0/manual/componentarchitecture.html">Comprehensive Guide to Zope Component Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose there are a couple of classes, Guest and Desk. Let’s define interfaces to them, plus a class that implements the Guest interface:</p>

<pre><code>import zope.interface
from zope.interface import implements
from zope.component import adapts, getGlobalSiteManager

class IDesk(zope.interface.Interface):
    def register():
        "Register a person"

class IGuest(zope.interface.Interface):
    name = zope.interface.Attribute ("""Person`s name""")

class Guest (object):
    implements(IGuest)

    def __init __ (self, name):
        self.name = name
</code></pre>

<p>The adapter must account for the anonymous guest by registering in the list of names:</p>

<pre><code>class GuestToDeskAdapter (object):
    adapts(IGuest)
    implements(IDesk)
    
    def __init __ (self, guest):
        self.guest = guest
    
    def register (self):
        guest_name_db.append (self.guest.name)
</code></pre>

<p>There is a registry that keeps track of adapters by interface. Thanks to it, you can get an adapter by passing an adaptable object to the call of the interface class. If the adapter is not registered, the second argument to the interface will be returned:</p>

<pre><code>guest = Guest ("Ivan")
adapter = IDesk (guest, alternate = None)
print adapter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; None found

gsm = getGlobalSiteManager ()
gsm.registerAdapter (GuestToDeskAdapter)

adapter = IDesk (guest, alternate = "None found")
print adapter

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; __ main __. GuestToDeskAdapter object at 0xb7beb64c&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This infrastructure is useful for splitting code into components and linking them together.</p>

<p>One of the most striking examples of using this approach besides Zope itself is the Twisted network framework, where a fair amount of the architecture relies on zope.interfaces interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Upon closer inspection, it turns out that interfaces and abstract base classes are two different things.</p>

<p>Abstract classes basically hardcode the required front-end part. Checking an object against the interface of an abstract class is checked using the built-in isinstance function; class - issubclass. An abstract base class should be included in the hierarchy as a base class or mixin.</p>

<p>The downside is the semantics of checks issubclass, isinstance, which intersect with ordinary classes (their inheritance hierarchy). No additional abstractions are built on the ABC.</p>

<p>Interfaces are a declarative entity, they do not set any boundaries; simply asserts that the class implements and its object provides the interface. Semantically, the statements implementedBy, providedBy are more correct. On such a simple basis, it is convenient to build a component architecture using adapters and other derived entities, which is what the large Zope and Twisted frameworks do.</p>

<p>It should be understood that the use of both tools makes sense only when building and using relatively large OOP systems - frameworks and libraries, in small programs they can only confuse and complicate the code with unnecessary abstractions.</p>

The popularity of fast charging technology has meant that most Chinese phone manufacturers now include fast charging technology in their gadgets. However, there is little quality control and scant respect for safety while implementing fast charging technology which could prove fatal to the user.</p><p>A team of researchers from <a href="https://xlab.tencent.com/cn/2020/07/16/badpower/" data-original-href="https://xlab.tencent.com/cn/2020/07/16/badpower/" data-component-tracked="1">Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab</a> has published a report which states that a large number of smartphones/tablets and even laptops are vulnerable to an explosion due to their fast charging feature. The Xuanwu Lab researchers have named this attack vector <strong>Bad Power</strong>.</p><p>According to the Xuanwu Lab <a href="https://xlab.tencent.com/cn/2020/07/16/badpower/">report</a>, threat actors could control the process of charging on a vulnerable device by rewriting a device’s firmware and causing smartphone components to burn/explode or generate electric overloads causing bodily harm to the user.</p><p>The Xuanwu Lab report explains that all power adapters feature power management circuitry is controlled by a power management IC (PMIC). The PMIC operates based on its own independent firmware. The firmware has set security parameters that regulate the necessary power voltage and current parameters. Xuanwu Lab report states that hackers could access this PMIC firmware, rewrite it, and make it vulnerable to Bad Power attacks through malware that resides in the terminal device. Essentially, the Xuanwu report states that threat actors could turn such devices into a time-bomb and cause them to burn/explode remotely.</p><p><img src="https://xlab.tencent.com/cn/uploads/2020/07/badpower_2.png" data-src="https://xlab.tencent.com/cn/uploads/2020/07/badpower_2.png" alt="badpower_2" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p><p>(The chip burned when a powered device was attacked by BadPower)</p><p>Bad Power works by modifying the firmware of a charging device. Once modified, the threat actors can control the power output and cause it to burn or explode smartphones, tablets, or laptops. The Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab researchers tested 35 fast-charging power bricks and power banks from eight different brands and powered by nine different PMICs. During the tests, the researchers found that 18 out of 35 fast-charging devices PMIC’s are vulnerable to Bad Power attacks. The researchers say that in these 18 fast charging chips, the legitimate firmware can easily be replaced by modified firmware. Among the 18 models, 11 models can be attacked through digital terminals that support fast charging.</p><h2>Demo Proof of Concept video:<br> <iframe width="175%" height="370vh" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-src="https://v.qq.com/txp/iframe/player.html?vid=u3115r95vil" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><span

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

      <p>This simple fact enables a few neat tricks.</p><p>A couple of famous examples come from the gaming industry. The classic example is the space trading game
      Elite, which was originally written for 8b BBC Micros in the early 80s. It was a totally revolutionary game, but
      just one thing that amazed fans was its complex universe of thousands of star systems. That was something you
      just didn’t normally get in games written for machines with kilobytes of RAM total. The trick was to generate the
      universe with a PRNG seeded with a small value. There was no need to store the universe in memory because the
      game could regenerate each star system on demand, repeatedly and deterministically.</p>
      <p>PRNGs are now widely exploited for recording games for replays. You don’t need to record every frame of the
      game world if you can just record the PRNG seed and all the player actions. (Like most things in software,
      <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/determinism-league-legends-introduction">actually implementing
      that can be surprisingly challenging</a>.)</p>
      <h2 id="random-mappings">Random mappings</h2>
      <p>In machine learning, you often need a mapping from things to highly dimensional random unit vectors (random
      vectors of length 1). Let’s get more specific and say you’re processing documents for topic/sentiment analysis or
      similarity. In this case you’ll generate a random vector for each word in the dictionary. Then you can create a
      vector for each document by adding up the vectors for each word in it (with some kind of weighting scheme, in
      practice). Similar documents will end up with similar vectors, and you can use linear algebra tricks to uncover
      deeper patterns (read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis">latent semantic
      analysis</a> if you’re interested).</p>
      <p>An obvious way to get a mapping between words and random vectors is to just initially generate a vector for
      each word, and create a hash table for looking them up later. Another way is to generate the random vectors on
      demand using a PRNG seeded by a hash of the word. Here’s a toy example:</p>
      <figure>

    <span>writeln</span><span>(</span><span>doc_vec</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
      </figure>
      <p>This kind of trick isn’t the answer to everything, but it has some uses. Obviously, it can be useful if you’re
      working with more data than you have RAM (though you might still cache some of the generated data). Another use
      case is processing a large dataset with parallel workers. In the document example, you can get workers to “agree”
      on what the vector for each word should be, without data synchronisation, and without needing to do an initial
      pass over the data to build a dictionary of words. I’ve used this trick with experimental code, just because I
      was too lazy to add an extra stage to the data pipeline. In some applications, recomputing data on the fly can
      even be faster than fetching it from a very large lookup table.</p>
      <h2 id="an-ode-to-xorshift">An ode to Xorshift</h2>
      <p>You might have noticed I used <code>Xoroshiro128Plus</code>, a
      variant of the Xorshift PRNG. The Mersenne Twister is a de facto standard PRNG in some computing fields, but I’m
      a bit of a fan of the Xorshift family. The basic Xorshift engines are fast and pretty good, and there are
      variants that are still fast and have excellent output quality. But the big advantage compared to the Mersenne
      Twister is the state size. The Mersenne Twister uses a pool of 2496 bytes of state, whereas most of the Xorshift
      PRNGs can fit into one or two machine <code>int</code>s.</p>
      <p>The small state size has a couple of advantages for this kind of “on demand” PRNG usage: One is that
      thoroughly initialising a big state from a small seed takes work (some people “warm up” a Mersenne Twister by
      throwing away several of the initial outputs, just to be sure). The second is that the small size of the PRNGs
      makes them cheap enough to use in places you wouldn’t think of using a Mersenne Twister.</p>
      <h2 id="random-data-structures-made-reliable">Random data structures made reliable</h2>
      <p>Some data structures and algorithms use randomisation. An example is a treap, which is a binary search tree
      that uses a randomised heap for balancing. Treaps are much less popular than AVL trees or red-black trees, but
      they’re easier to implement correctly because you end up with fewer edge cases. They’re also good enough for most
      use cases. That makes them a good choice for application-specific “augmented” BSTs. But for argument purposes,
      it’s just a real example of a data structure that happens to use randomness as an implementation detail.</p>
      <p>Randomisation comes with a major drawback: it’s a pain when testing and debugging. Test failures aren’t
      reproducible for debugging if real randomness is used. If you have any experience with testing, you’ll have seen
      this and you’ll know it’s a good idea to use a PRNG instead.</p>
      <p>Using a global PRNG mostly works, but it couples the treaps through one shared PRNG. That accidental coupling
      can lead to test flakes if you’re running several tests at once, unless you’re careful to use one PRNG per thread
      and reset it for every test. Even then you can get Heisenbugs in your non-test code.</p>
      <p>What about dependency injection? Making every treap method require a reference to a PRNG works, but it leaks
      the implementation detail throughout your code. You could make the treap take a reference to a PRNG in its
      constructor, but that implies adding an extra pointer to the data structure. If you’re going to do that, why not
      just make every treap embed its own 32b or 64b Xorshift PRNG? Embedding the PRNG into the treap makes it
      deterministic and reproducible in a way that’s encapsulated and decoupled from everything else.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this blog post, we look at three approaches for eliminating duplicate objects from Arrays.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="eliminating-duplicates-from-arrays">Eliminating duplicates from Arrays&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Eliminating duplicate values from Arrays is simple – as long as the values are primitive (and therefore compared by value):</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> values = [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>, <span>'jane'</span>];
<span>const</span> uniqueValues = [...new <span>Set</span>(values)];
assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueValues,
  [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>]);
</code></pre>
<p>However, that approach doesn’t work with the following data because a Set would consider each object to be unique:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> members = [
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
  },
];
</code></pre>
<h2 id="approach-1%3A-building-a-new-array-without-duplicates">Approach 1: building a new Array without duplicates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code><span>const</span> uniqueMembers1 = [];

<span>for</span> (<span>const</span> m <span>of</span> members) {
  <span>if</span> (!containsMember(uniqueMembers1, m)) {
    uniqueMembers1.push(m);
  }
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>containsMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.find(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers1,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>We only add an object from <code>members</code> to <code>uniqueMembers1</code> if it doesn’t already exist in that Array. That’s why the earlier Jane with ID <code>'10yejma'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-2%3A-using-.filter()">Approach 2: using <code>.filter()</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers2 = members.filter(
  <span>(<span>m, index, ms</span>) =&gt;</span> getIndexOfMember(ms, m) === index);

<span><span>function</span> <span>getIndexOfMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.findIndex(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers2,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p><code>getIndexOfMember()</code> returns the first index where a member appears. We tell <code>.filter()</code> to only keep the members at those indices. That’s why the first Jane “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3%3A-a-map-from-unique-keys-to-members">Approach 3: a Map from unique keys to members&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueKeyToMember = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>(
  members.map(<span><span>m</span> =&gt;</span> [m.first+<span>'\t'</span>+m.last, m])); 
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers3 = [...uniqueKeyToMember.values()];

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers3,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>If an object that is added to the Map has the same unique key as a previous object, it replaces that object. That’s why the later Jane with ID <code>'1y15hhu'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h3 id="variants-of-approach-1-and-approach-2">Variants of approach 1 and approach 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We use a Set to record unique keys of members that we have visited. If the key of the current member is already in that Set, then we don’t push it (approach 1) or filter it out (approach 2).</p>
<p>This may help with large Arrays because we don’t have to search them. On the other hand, creating keys and maintaining a Set affects performance negatively.</p>

                    <p>Kernel, a start-up claiming to offer “Neuroscience as a Service” has been in the news lately because of their recently announced $53M Series C fund raising. What hasn’t been as widely covered is what their services are and how they work.</p><p>Fortunately Kernel has published a fairly <a href="https://www.kernel.co/hello-humanity">extensive breakdown</a> of their research and the resulting products they plan to bring to market. Kernel is focused on measuring signals in the brain to better understand the brain and advance neuroscience more quickly, eventually hoping to be able to read and write cognition. Traditional tools for measuring brain activity like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI and Electroencephalography &nbsp;(EEG) are costly, bulky and difficult to use in real-life situations that would produce more meaningful data.</p><p>To solve this problem, Kernel has developed two different technologies for measuring brain activity it calls Flow and Flux, which it hopes will scale our understanding of the human brain, leading to advances in brain health and overall brain performance to name just a few potential benefits. Kernel believes that using both technologies in conjunction will result in even faster advances in how brain activity is measured.</p><p>Kernel Flow is a technology for measuring hemodynamics, that is the flow of blood, in the brain. This is similar to an FMRI, only without needing the patient to lie perfectly still in a room-sized machine. Flow by contrast is a wearable headset which allows the wearer to engage in normal activities, and the data is processed in a connected computer (currently tethered via USB, though wireless data transfer certainly seems feasible given the relative transfer rates of USB and WiFi standards).</p><p>Kernel Flux uses advanced devices that measure magnetic fields called optically pumped magnetometers or OPMs, while still allowing the subject to move their head normally and comfortably. The flux system is also able to distinguish background magnetic fields not coming from the subject (such as the magnetic fields created by power lines or other parts of the human body) and filter them out, resulting in a higher signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Kernel detailed two experiments to demonstrate the fidelity of its neural activity measurements, “Speller” and “Speak ID.” Both experiments described are reproductions of previously published experiments using sensors that seems to have been the precursors to its Kernel Flux technology.</p><p>In the Speller experiment, subjects were shown 30, eight-letter words (240 total letters), and asked to spell each word after it was displayed by looking at a visual keyboard. Using 20 OPMs, placed on the subjects head, the researchers were able to measure the brain waves of the participants, then run them through a statistical method known as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). With this analysis, the researchers were able to correctly predict which letter the subject was looking at an average of 80% of the time. In subsequent experiments, they were able to nearly reproduce the performance of 20 sensors using only 4 sensors.</p><p>The Sound ID experiment used 16 OPM sensors again placed on the heads of the subjects, while the subject selected 60 second snippets of recorded speech. Again using CCA analysis on the real-time data fed from the sensors the researchers were able to determine which snippet the subject was listening to with 100% accuracy in most cases in under 20 seconds. The experiment was also run using snippets of songs instead of speech, and while the results were less accurate and predictions took longer, they were able to predict 8 out of 10 songs correctly in some subjects.</p><p>Kernel has promised to share results from their Flow and Flux hardware soon. Until then, we'll be wondering what new insights might be gleaned from these novel ways of collecting data directly from the brain. </p>

July 17, 2020 | https://alhassy.github.io/TypedLisp.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alhassy.github.io/TypedLisp.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-typing-via-macros">
<p>
Checking the type of inputs is tedious and so I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cct5hp/functional_type_declarations_in_elisp/">guessed</a> it could be done using
macros and advice. Looking at <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/types.html">Typed Racket</a> for inspiration, the following
fictitious syntax would add advice to <code>f</code> that checks the optional arguments <code>xᵢ</code>
have type <code>σᵢ</code> and the mandatory positional arguments have type <code>τᵢ</code> according
to position, and the result of the computation is of type <code>τ</code>.
To the best of my knowledge, no one had done this for Emacs Lisp —I don't know why.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(declare-type 'f ((<span>:x₁</span> σ₁) … (<span>:xₘ</span> σₘ)) (τ₁ … τₙ τ))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To modify a variable, or function, we may simply redefine it; but a much more elegant and powerful
approach is to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">“advise”</a> the current entity with some new behaviour. In our case of interest, we will
<i>advise functions to check their arguments before executing their bodies</i>.
</p>

<p>
Below is my attempt: <a id="org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a>. Before you get scared or think it's horrendous, be charitable and
note that about a third of the following is documentation and a third is local declarations.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(<span>cl-defmacro</span> <span>declare-type</span> (f key-types <span>&amp;rest</span> types)
  <span>"Attach the given list of types to the function ‘f’</span>
<span>   by advising the function to check its arguments’ types</span>
<span>   are equal to the list of given types.</span>

<span>   We name the advice ‘⟪f⟫-typing-advice’ so that further</span>
<span>   invocations to this macro overwrite the same advice function</span>
<span>   rather than introducing additional, unintended, constraints.</span>

<span>   Using type specifiers we accommodate for unions of types</span>
<span>   and subtypes, etc ♥‿♥.</span>

<span>   ‘</span><span>key-types</span><span>’ should be of the shape (:x₀ t₀ ⋯ :xₙ tₙ);</span>
<span>    when there are no optional types, use symbol “:”.</span>

<span>    E.g., (declare-type my-func (:z string :w integer) integer symbol string)</span>
<span>  "</span>

  <span>;; </span><span>Basic coherency checks. When there aren't optional types, key-types is the “:” symbol.</span>

<p>
There are some notable shortcomings: Lack of support for type variables and, for now, no support for
optional arguments. Nonetheless, I like it —of course.
( Using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Watching-Variables.html#Watching-Variables">variable watchers</a> we could likely add support for type variables as well as
function-types. )
</p>

<p>
<b>We accidentally forgot to consider an argument.</b>
</p>
<div>
<pre>(declare-type f₁ (<span>:z</span> <span>string</span> <span>:w</span> <span>list</span>) integer symbol <span>string</span>)

(f₁ 'x) <span>;; </span><span>⇒ f₁: Insufficient number of arguments; given 2, (x), but 3 are needed.</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The type declaration said we needed 3 arguments, but we did not consider one of them.
</p>

<p>

(f₃ 144 <span>"two"</span>)
<span>;; </span><span>⇒ f₃: Type mismatch! Expected symbol for argument 1 ≠ Given string "two".</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Notice: When multiple positional arguments have type-errors, the errors are reported one at a time.
</p>

<p>
<b>A keyword argument is supplied of the wrong type.</b>
</p>
<div>
<pre>(f₃ 1 'two <span>:z</span> 'no₀ <span>:w</span> 'no₁)

(f₆ 'hi)     <span>;; </span><span>⇒  Keyword argument 144 not one of (:z)</span>
(f₆)         <span>;; </span><span>⇒ 65; i.e., the character ‘A’</span>

(f₆ <span>:z</span> 10) <span>;; </span><span>⇒ 65; i.e., the expected output since 10 mod 5 ≈ 0 &amp; so 10 is valid input.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>Preconditions!</b> The previous example had a complex type on a keyword, but that was
essentially a pre-condition; we can do the same on positional arguments.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(declare-type f₇ : (satisfies (<span>lambda</span> (it) (<span>=</span> it 5)))
                   integer)
(<span>cl-defun</span> <span>f₇</span> (n) n)
<span>;; </span><span>The identity on 5 function; and undefined otherwise.</span>

(f₇ 4)
<span>;; </span><span>⇒ f₇: Type mismatch! Expected (satisfies (lambda (it) (= it 5))) for argument 0</span>
<span>;;       </span><span>≠ Given integer 4.</span>

(f₇ 5) <span>;; </span><span>⇒ 5</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>Postconditions!</b>
Given an integer greater than 5, we present an integer greater than 2; i.e.,
this is a constructive proof that \(∀ n • n &gt; 5 ⇒ n &gt; 2\).
</p>
<div>
<pre>(declare-type f₈ : (satisfies (<span>lambda</span> (in)  (<span>&gt;</span> in 5)))
                   (satisfies (<span>lambda</span> (out) (<span>&gt;</span> out 2))))
(<span>cl-defun</span> <span>f₈</span> (n) n)
<span>;; </span><span>The identity on 5 function; and undefined otherwise.</span>

(f₈ 4)
<span>;; </span><span>⇒  f₈: Type mismatch! Expected (satisfies (lambda (in) (&gt; in 5))) for argument 0</span>
<span>;;        </span><span>≠ Given integer 4.</span>

(f₈ 72) <span>;; </span><span>⇒ 72; since indeed 72 &gt; 5 for the input, and clearly 72 &gt; 2 for the output.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As it currently stands we cannot make any explicit references between the inputs
and the output, but that's an easy fix: Simply add a local function <code>old</code> to the
<a href="#org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a> macro which is intentionally exposed so that it can be used in the
type declarations to refer to the ‘old’, or initial, values provided to the function.
Additionally, one could also add keyword arguments <code>:requires</code> and <code>:ensures</code>
for a more sophisticated pre- and post-condition framework.
<a href="https://github.com/sellout/quid-pro-quo">Something</a> along these lines is implemented for Common Lisp.
</p>

<p>
Here's a fun exercise: Recast the <a href="https://liquid.kosmikus.org/01-intro.html#/what-is-liquid-haskell">Liquid Haskell</a> examples in Lisp using this
<a href="#org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a> form.

<p>
I'd wake up to the sound of waves in the Outer Sunset.
Ride my bike past the eastbound N. Judah bus heading inland. Whiz crosstown to that bright red door in SoMa. That dreadful, joyful, awful, inspiring red door.

</p>

<p>
Every day behind that red door, five of us wandering souls congregated. We dodged the morning glory of San Franciscoâ€™s shit and piss to enter the path of mastery.
</p>

<p>
One hour of instruction. A full day of building subsets of various popular technologies, from scratch.
</p>

<p>
<em>Calm practice.</em>
</p>

<p>
We were accustomed to frantic practice - college taught us to treat knowledge as something disembodied from us, as if it were something to drink up, consume, cram. We were thirsty, so our college professors tried to quench us with dusty slides on overhead projectors.
</p>

<p>
I struggled with calm practice. It didnâ€™t let me hide. Oz and Myles insisted that there is no knowledge without fundamental understanding. As we wrote our programs, Oz would ask us:
</p>

<p>
â€œLet me see your understanding.â€�
</p>

<p>
So we had to show our work. Our hand scribbles, our test cases, our questions, our explanations, our exposition, our diagrams.
</p>

<p>
Some days, my monkey mind hated this relentless pursuit of understanding. I would grow frustrated by my lack of skills. Iâ€™d hack together a program that barely worked.
</p>

<p>
Oz had a sixth sense for this. On this day, noticing my frustration, he came over to me and placed an Albert Einstein bobblehead next to my laptop.
</p>

<p><img src="https://ammarmian.com/img/einstein.png" alt="Einstein bobblehead"></p><p>
The calm yet unending repetition of Albertâ€™s finger touching forehead reminded me: â€œJust think. Itâ€™s all in there.â€�
</p>

<p>
I wish I could say I was enlightened on the spot. Instead I silently told Oz to go fuck himself, and he chuckled and walked away.
</p>

<h3>
Old School, New School
</h3>

<p>
This was my experience as part of the first experimental cohort of the Bradfield School of Computer Science. In 6 months of studying with Oz and Myles, I learned more than I ever had from regurgitating textbook concepts for exams.
</p>

<p>
My time at Bradfield set me on a path to discover education continuously from the experts all around me. That sounds so obvious, but I always thought I needed permission to learn. I thought education was something static that I acquired once and never needed to think about again.
</p>

<p>
What I didn't understand: our economy was built for static expertise. Go to college, gain credentials, and youâ€™ll be set for the rest of your life. Take a course or a workshop, and ride the certification train to a raise or promotion.
</p>

<p>
Our world is anything but static. Technology, business innovation, and social movements have changed the landscape in a radical way. Your economics and political science degree doesnâ€™t prepare you for what you need to know in the world. Even your technical degree or advanced credential doesnâ€™t quite prepare you.
</p>

<p>
We are by and large using Old World tactics to navigate the New World. The rules have changed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Old World</strong>: unflagging economic growth, rapid job creation, government-subsidized education, big companies offering long careers, ordinary Americans taking out low-interest loans from local banks.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New World</strong>: rapid digital automation of jobs and mass layoffs, high education costs, stagnant economic growth, ordinary Americans mired in all sorts of debt.
</p>

<p>
The existing institutions gave us the paternalistic comfort that they understood what was going on. Only they could teach you what you need to learn to succeed in the world.
</p>

<p>
These institutions no longer play that role. We donâ€™t trust these institutions as much as we used to. This is a healthy stance.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Old School</strong>: packaged, exam-based, lecturer-led, synchronous, passive and isolated, credential-oriented.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New School</strong>: a la carte, project-based, practitioner-led, asynchronous, immersive and collaborative, accomplishment-oriented.
</p>

<p>
Legacy institutions are now scrambling to keep up with new forms of education that are emerging around us. These new forms are bootcamps, intensive trade schools, online courses provided directly by masters of the craft, live screencasts and videos.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Old Mind</strong>: passively receive instruction, memorize concepts, take lecture notes, cram for the exam, and receive a grade not directly tied to accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New Mind</strong>: actively engage with instruction, play and reconfigure concepts, shadow the practitioner, and gauge understanding through direct accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
This is all really exciting stuff. The New Mind is going to be the biggest differentiator in the modern world for years to come. The New Mind learns differently. Yet we are still entering these new education forms with the Old Mind.
</p>

<h3>
Old Mind, New Mind
</h3>

<p>
You see, the New School requires the New Mind. The New Mind is very much like the mind of our heroes of antiquity, the Montaignes and Spinozas and Galileos, the autodidacts fashioning their own educations through apprenticeship and self-discovery.
</p>

<p>
The new is the old made fashionable again. The old had never left, it had just gone into hiding, waiting for a worthy society to rediscover it. We are a worthy society, and we have rediscovered The New Mind.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s the teacher pointing at the bobblehead.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s the bobbleheadâ€™s finger pointing at its head.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s the whole situation reminding you that you have all the tools to reinvent yourself.
And reinvention is how you subvert The Old Mind. This subversion reveals The New Mind that you possessed all along.

<hr>
<p><span>A</span><strong>re</strong> you following tech- or privacy-related
news? If so, you might have heard about <em>differential privacy</em>. The concept is
popular both in academic circles and inside tech companies. Both <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/">Apple</a> or
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/10/learning-statistics-with-privacy-aided.html">Google</a> use differential privacy to collect data in a private way.</p>
<p>So, what's this definition about? How is it better than <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-anonymity.html">definitions</a>  <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-map.html">that</a>  <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/l-diversity.html">came</a>  <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/delta-presence.html">before</a>?
More importantly, why should you care? What makes it so exciting to researchers
and tech companies? In this post, I'll try to explain the idea behind
differential privacy and its advantages. I'll do my best to keep it simple and
accessible for everyone&nbsp;—&nbsp;not only technical folks.</p>

<p>This process can be <em>anything</em>. For example, it can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>computing some statistic ("tell me how many users have red hair")</li>
<li>an anonymization strategy ("remove names and last three digits of ZIP codes")</li>
<li>a machine learning training process ("build a model to predict which users
  like cats")</li>
<li>… you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a process differentially private, you usually have to modify it a little
bit. Typically, you add some randomness, or <em>noise</em>, in some places. What
exactly you do, and how much noise you add, depends on which process you're
modifying. I'll abstract that part away and simply say that your process is now
doing some unspecified ✨&nbsp;magic&nbsp;✨.</p>

<p>By "basically the same", I don't mean "it looks a bit similar". Instead,
remember that the magic you added to the process was <em>randomized</em>. You don't
always get the same output if you run the new process several times. So what
does "basically the same" means in this context? That the <em>probability
distributions</em> are similar. You can get the <em>exact same</em> output with database 1
or with database 2, with similar likelihood.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with privacy? Well, suppose you're a creepy person
trying to figure out whether your target is in the original data. By looking at
the output, you can't be 100% certain of anything. Sure, it could have come from
a database with your target in it. But it could also have come from the exact
same database, without your target. Both options have a similar probability, so
there's not much you can say.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that this definition is not like the ones we've seen
before. We're not saying that the output data satisfies differential privacy.
We're saying that the <em>process</em> does. This is very different from <span>\(k\)</span>-anonymity
and other definitions we've seen. There is no way to look at data and determine
whether it satisfies differential privacy. You have to know the <em>process</em> to
know whether it is "anonymizing" enough.</p>
<p>And that's about it. It's a tad more abstract than other definitions we've seen,
but not that complicated. So, why all the hype? What makes it so awesome
compared to older, more straightforward definitions?</p>

<p>Privacy experts, especially in academia, are enthusiastic about differential
privacy. It was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry, Kobbi Nissim
and Adam Smith in 2006<sup id="fnref:papers"><a href="#fn:papers" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Very soon, almost all researchers working on
anonymization started building differentially private algorithms. And, as we've
already mentioned, tech companies are also trying to use it whenever possible.
So, why all the hype? I can count three main reasons.</p>
<h2 id="you-no-longer-need-attack-modeling">You no longer need attack modeling</h2>
<p>Remember the previous definitions we've seen? (If not, you're fine, just take my
word for it&nbsp;:D) Why did we need <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-map.html"><span>\(k\)</span>-map</a> in certain cases, and
<a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-anonymity.html"><span>\(k\)</span>-anonymity</a> or <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/delta-presence.html"><span>\(\delta\)</span>-presence</a> in others? To choose the right one,
we had to figure out the attacker's <em>capabilities</em> and <em>goals</em>. In practice,
this is pretty difficult. You might not know exactly what your attacker is
capable of. Worse, there might be <em>unknown unknowns</em>: attack vectors that you
hadn't imagined at all. You can't make very broad statements when you use
old-school definitions. You have to make some assumptions, which you can't be
100% sure of.</p>
<p>By contrast, when you use differential privacy, you get two awesome guarantees.</p>
<ol>
<li>You protect <em>any kind of information about an individual</em>. It doesn't matter
   what the attacker wants to do. Reidentify their target, know if they're in
   the dataset, deduce some sensitive attribute… All those things are protected.
   Thus, you don't have to think about the goals of your attacker.</li>
<li>It works <em>no matter what the attacker knows about your data</em>. They might
   already know some people in the database. They might even add some fake users
   to your system. With differential privacy, it doesn't matter. The users that
   the attacker doesn't know are still protected.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="you-can-quantify-the-privacy-loss">You can quantify the privacy loss <a name="quantify"></a></h2>
<p>We saw that when using <span>\(k\)</span>-anonymity, <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-anonymity.html#how-to-choose-k">choosing the parameter</a> <span>\(k\)</span> is pretty
tricky. There is no clear link between which <span>\(k\)</span> to choose and how "private" the
dataset is. The problem is <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/l-diversity.html#the-bad-news-policy">even worse</a> with other definitions. This problem is
present in all other definitions we've seen so far.</p>
<p>Differential privacy is much better. When you use it, you can quantify the
<em>greatest possible information gain</em> by the attacker. The corresponding
parameter, usually named <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>, allows you to make very strong statements.
Suppose <span>\(\varepsilon=1.1\)</span>. Then, you can say: "an attacker who thinks their target
is in the dataset with probability 50% can increase their level of certainty to
at most 75%."</p>
<p>And do you remember the previous point about attack modeling? It means you can
change this statement in many ways. You can replace "their target is is the
dataset" by anything about one individual. And you can add "no matter what the
attacker knows" if you want to be extra-precise. Altogether, that makes
differential privacy much stronger than all definitions that came before.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-compose-multiple-mechanisms">You can compose multiple mechanisms <a name="composition"></a></h2>
<p>Suppose you have some data. You want to share it with Alex and with Brinn, in
some anonymized fashion. You trust Alex and Brinn equally, so you use the same
definition of privacy for both of them. They are not interested in the same
aspects of the data, so you give them two different versions of your data. Both
versions are "anonymous", for the definition you've chosen.</p>
<p>What happens if Alex and Brinn decide to conspire, and compare the data you gave
them? Will the union of the two anonymized versions still be anonymous? It turns
out that for most definitions of privacy, this is not the case. If you put two
<span>\(k\)</span>-anonymous versions of the same data together, the result won't be
<span>\(k\)</span>-anonymous. So if Alex and Brinn conspire, they might be able to reidentify
users on their own… or even reconstruct all the original data! That's definitely
not good news.</p>
<p>If you used differential privacy, you get to avoid this type of scenario.
Suppose that you gave differentially private data to Alex and Brinn. Each time,
you used a parameter of <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>. Then if they conspire, the resulting data
is still protected by differential privacy, except that the privacy is now
weaker: the parameter becomes <span>\(2\varepsilon\)</span>. So they gain something, but you
still quantify how much information they got. Privacy experts call this property
<em>composition</em>.</p>
<p>This scenario sounds a bit far-fetched, but composition is super useful in
practice. Organizations often want to do many things with data. Publish
statistics, release an anonymized version, train machine learning algorithms…
Composition is a way to stay in control of the level of risk as new use cases
appear and processes evolve.</p>

<p>I hope the basic intuition behind differential privacy is now clear. Want a
one-line summary? Uncertainty in the process means uncertainty for the attacker,
which means better privacy.</p>
<p>I also hope that you're now wondering <em>how it actually works</em>! What hides behind
this magic that makes everything private and safe? Why does differential privacy
have all the awesome properties I've mentioned? What a coincidence! That's the
topic of a <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-more-detail.html">follow-up article</a>, which tries to give more details while still
staying clear of heavy math.</p>

  <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://breandan.github.io/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>On January 22, 1970, a Pan Am Boeing 747 touched down at Heathrow for the first time.<a href="#footnote-10TY" id="ref-10TY"><sup>1</sup></a> It was the 747’s first commercial flight. At the time, British Airways had 11 of the jumbo jets on order.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to ride on one. I’m too late.</p>
<p>British Airways announced yesterday they’re retiring their entire 747 fleet. Permanently. Its cousins are also in trouble: the double-decker <span>A380</span> is grounded worldwide.</p>
<p>Landing slots at Heathrow are scarce. In 2016, Oman Air bought a single morning slot from Air France for $75 million. So while the 777, <span>A340</span>, and 787 use less than half the fuel per passenger to fly, airlines need jumbo jets to maximize passenger throughput.</p>
<p>Nowadays double-deckers are merely a waste of fuel. Just like a species facing an extinction event, the 747 got wiped out by an economic chokepoint.</p>
<p>Intelligent-designers often cite gaps in the archaeological record as evidence against natural selection. <em>If evolution inched along slowly</em>, they argue, <em>where are the fossils of almost-humans, and almost-almost-humans, and almost-almost-almost humans? Shouldn’t we find skulls of humans with tiny eyes, slightly-less-tiny eyes, all the way up to regular-sized eyes?</em></p>
<p>But evolution doesn’t crawl along in a straight line. Adaptation happens slowly, and then all at once. Chokepoints force the<span></span> <span>“</span>all at once.”</p>
<p>For example, birds in Britain and Denmark have been under attack by asphalt for a century. In Britain, it’s popular to load birdseed into birdfeeders and place them in gardens. Not so in Denmark. Within 40 years, the beaks of British birds have grown 1-2mm longer than their Danish counterparts.<a href="#footnote-20TY" id="ref-20TY"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>For millennia the beaks have stayed the same. And then asphalt, in a mere half century, forced British bird beaks to grow up to 10% longer.</p>
<p>Business follows the same pattern. Innovation prods along slowly. And then one day the economy’s equilibrium gets punctured.</p>
<p>We are in one of those economic chokepoints. The 747 and <span>A380</span> are collateral damage.</p>
<p>What else is facing evolutionary death because of COVID?</p>
<p>It might be better to invert that question. What types of businesses will survive despite COVID? What traits do those businesses have that will spread like memes throughout the economy?</p>

      <p><i>And other musings about UTF-8/Unicode</i></p><hr>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This summer I've had the amazing opportunity to work on Revery/Onivim full time
      as a software intern at Outrun Labs, an experience I'll do a more detailed writeup
      of near the end of the summer.</p>
      <p>One of the goals of the internship was to get font fallback working in Revery
      and Onivim. Font fallback is one of those features that all GUI frameworks nowadays
      simply must have. I'm sure we've all seen the infamous "unknown glyph" mark at least
      once. Seeing ￼ or � might be passable for an emoji here or there, but it's simply
      unacceptable if you're expecting to see your native language on the screen.</p><h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Back in the old days, most digital text was represented in ASCII. As far as text encodings
      go, ASCII is pretty much as simple as it gets -- each character is an 8 bit/1 byte
      integer that corresponds to a character. However, that only leaves us with 2<sup>8</sup>
      or 256 characters we can represent. If you're only ever writing English/Latin scripts,
      that's more than enough. The problem with ASCII is its 'A' - "American."</p>

      <p>Eventually UTF-8 and Unicode came along with the ability to represent an arbitrary
      number of characters while still maintaining compatibility with ASCII. Great! Except
      for one thing -- just because Unicode/UTF-8 supports a character doesn't mean any
      given font will contain a glyph for it. Here inlies the problem: <b>barring a very small
      subset, most fonts only have glyphs for one language/script.</b></p>

      <p>As of a couple days ago, if I opened a file in Onivim2 with its default font
      (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>) and that file happened
      to contain any Japanese characters, this is what would show up:</p>

      <div>
        <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/onivim2-no-cjk.png"></p><p>Line 132: The string "こんにちは、私の名前はザックです" should appear.
      </p></div>

      <p>I should note that as of now, Onivim2 is in it's alpha stage (soon to be beta!),
      so this kind of bug is to be expected.</p>

      <p>The crux of the issue here is that JetBrains Mono,
      while a great font, does not contain any CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) glyphs. In most
      cases, it's the job of the underlying UI framework to find a font that <i>does</i>
      support these glyphs. Revery should be no different, and the following is how I solved this problem in it.</p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>Luckily we (the Revery team) were far from the first people to encounter this problem.
      Revery's text rendering pipeline looks like this (extremely simplified):</p>

      <div>
        <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/revery-text-render-pipeline.svg"></p><p>If you're interested in learning more about Revery's tech stack, the library's creator (and my boss),
          Bryan Phelps, gave this great talk about it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3JqNaw0-Us">here</a>.
          Note that some of Revery's tech has changed since then (namely the inclusion of Skia), but the core
          principles are still the same!</p>
      </div>

      <p>This is the most simplified case: we already have a typeface loaded into memory
      and it supports all the glyphs we requested from it. In this case, we ask Harfbuzz,
      a text shaping library, to "shape" the text. In the case where the string is 
      "ABC", this is fairly trivial. However, since a single UTF-8 encoded character can
      take up multiple bytes, the shaping utility that Harfbuzz provides cannot be overstated.
      This is especially true in a language like OCaml/ReasonML, where for historical reasons
      (as described above), it's assumed that all characters in a string take up a single byte.</p>

      <p>A sample output from Harfbuzz can be seen below. For demonstration purposes, I chose to
      shape the string "κόσμε" because each character has a different size</p>
<p><code><pre>-- κόσμε --
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 539 Cluster: 0
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 2690 Cluster: 2
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 305 Cluster: 5
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 541 Cluster: 7
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 304 Cluster: 9
</pre></code></p><p>Here the glyph ID is the corresponding glyph in the string, and the cluster is the
      <i>byte</i> index of the character in the original string. It may not seem like it, but
      these two components are extremely helpful in implementing a fallback solution.</p>

      <p>First, luckily the standard "unknown" glyph ID for all fonts is 0. If Harfbuzz comes
      across a cluster where the font has no corresponding glyph in the table, it will return the glyph
      ID 0. Let's shape the string "ABC😃XYZ"</p>
<p><code><pre>-- ABC😀XYZ --
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 36 Cluster: 0
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 37 Cluster: 1
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 38 Cluster: 2
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 0 Cluster: 3
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 59 Cluster: 7
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 60 Cluster: 8
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 61 Cluster: 9
</pre></code></p><p>As you can see, where the emoji occurs, the glyph ID is 0 (the font here is Arial).
      For our purposes, we'll call any group of 0-glyphs a <b>hole</b>.</p>

      <p>The next important piece of the puzzle is finding a font that can render that glyph.
      Luckily, Skia provides an API for just that: <code>SkFontMgr::matchFamilyStyleCharacter</code>.
      By simply giving it a font family name (one to most closely match), a character, and
      a locale, we can get a font back that is guaranteed to be able to render that character.
      Awesome, right? Now we can create a basic fallback implementation in pseudocode:</p>

<p><code><pre>let glyphsAndClusters = Harfbuzz.shape(string);
let result = [];
for each glyph and cluster pair:
  if glyph == 0:
    let typeface = Skia.matchCharacter(...);
    let character = String.utf8CharacterAt(cluster);
    let newGlyph = Harfbuzz.shape(character);
    add(result, newGlyph); 
</pre></code></p><p>Hooray! It works*!</p>
      
      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/initial-font-fallback.png">
      </p>

      <p>"What's the asterisk for?" you may be wondering. Well, if only it were that simple! Many
      UTF-8 characters you would think of as a single character are actually multiple. For
      instance, all emoji flags are actually the region codes of the country they represent:
      🇺🇸 is 🇺 🇸, 🇮🇱 is 🇮 🇱, 🇯🇵 is 🇯 🇵 , etc. Fun fact: an old bug in Twitter actually
      counted flags as two of your 140 characters! Surely font shaping algorithms have improved
      since then! Anyway, what happens when we try to render one of these flags in Revery?</p>

      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/bad-flag-rendering.png">
      </p>

      <p>Dang! To be expected, but annoying nonetheless. Alright, how about we try refactoring
      our API to shape holes together? Unfortunately this algorithm is a bit too long to condense
      into easily understandable pseudocode, but if you're curious, you can check out the actual
      implementation <a href="https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/blob/7e726608280470268651abd3dcdd9be133786974/src/Font/FontCache.re#L168-L318">here</a>.
      Basically, we create a recursive function to group all the contiguous holes together, shape
      the substrings that represent the holes, and reassemble the string into an array of shapes.
      Since OCaml lacks first class UTF-8 support, we had to leverage a library called Zed to find
      the UTF-8 bounds in a string. This complicates things a little bit, but luckily Zed's API
      is pretty easy to understand. Let's test that flag again:</p>

      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/correct-flag-rendering.png">
      </p>

      <p>Success! Although this may be simplistic compared to the fallback algorithms in Blink or
      Gecko, it's not as far off as you might think! In fact, much of the inspiration I got from
      this algorithm came from <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/README.md#text-shaping">
      this incredibly helpful document</a>. There is a lot of corporate boilerplate that complicates
      the actual underlying algorithm in the Blink source, but the core idea is still the same.</p>

      <p>Not only do we get emoji flags, we also get those Japanese characters we couldn't see
      earlier:</p>

      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/onivim2-cjk.png">
      </p>

      <p>Beautiful, if I may say so myself 😎.</p>

      <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
      <p>Although this may not seem that complex, this was one of the largest PRs I've ever written for
      Revery. There were a lot of holes (pun intended) that were exposed when we were expecting UTF-8
      strings to "just work"™️. One of the biggest was text wrapping. One of my good friends (the one who introduced me
      to Revery in the first place), <a href="https://ohad.space/">Ohad Rau</a>, wrote the text wrapping
      algorithm initially, and he was extremely helpful in my quest to get the algorithm UTF-8 compliant.</p>

      <p>I also want to thank <a href="https://github.com/bryphe">Bryan Phelps</a> and 
      <a href="https://github.com/glennsl">Glenn Slotte</a> for some algorithm suggestions and improvements.
      Both of them have been immensely helpful not only for this feature, but the entire summer. I've learned
      so much during this summer, and I'm incredibly grateful to Bryan for giving me this opportunity.</p>

    <p>
     Almost a year has passed since the devastating firebombing of Kyoto Animation
that murdered thirty-six employees and harmed many others. Kyoto Animation,
affectionately known as KyoAni, is an anime studio that has earned the love of
countless fans, and I am proud to include myself among them. KyoAni receives the
devotion it does because it has changed lives for the better, and every KyoAni
fan probably has a story to tell. I first came to know KyoAni from <em>K-On</em>, a
heartfelt show capturing the nostalgic innocence of adolescence through the
youthful adventures of five girls in a band. <em>K-On</em> taught me to appreciate the
fleeting moments of life, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em> is an anime created by Kyoto Animation under director Naoko Yamada and
screenwriter Reiko Yoshida, adapted from a manga by Kakifly. <em>K-On</em> follows the
five members of the Sakuragaoka Girls' School's Light Music Club, or <em>keionbu</em>:
Yui Hirasawa on lead guitar, Mio Akiyama on bass, Ritsu Tainaka on drums, Mugi
Kotobuki on keyboard, and their underclassman Azusa Nakano on rhythm guitar.
Over their three years of high school, the girls connect over school life, band
practice, and after-school tea time in the music room, and they become tight
friends.

     </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
     Truthfully, <em>K-On</em>'s first season is merely mediocre: enjoyable, but not
memorable. <em>K-On</em>'s second season, which depicts senior year for Yui, Mio,
Ritsu, and Mugi, is where it really shines as a poignant tale of friendship and
adolescence. When the girls reunite and banter in the music room before class on
their first day back, you get the feeling that they've all been friends since
forever. However, right from the get-go, there is a tone shift: the atmosphere
is melancholy as the friends plan their exciting year ahead, their last year
together. Time seems to pass slowly as the <em>keionbu</em> spends its remaining months
together bonding even closer, with a field trip to Kansai, a school play of
Romeo and Juliet, and one last school festival performance before graduation.
<em>K-On</em> reminds us to cherish our youth and our time with friends: these days are
limited. However, if we make the most of our time together, even after we go our
separate ways we'll still have the warmth of all the fond memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     I first watched <em>K-On</em> in my junior year of high school. Before, I didn't care
to make memories. I was obsessed with programming language theory and
constructive mathematics, and I single-mindedly focused on learning higher-level
math on my own. I was eager to leave high school so I could study my passions
in college, and I was even thinking about graduate school! However, after I
watched the <em>keionbu</em> spend its carefree days together before saying goodbye, I
felt intense regret and asked myself: How had I been spending my own high school
days? <em>K-On</em> made me realize that I was growing up too fast, there was more to
life than just math, and I was missing out on a lot of memories in a chapter of
life that I would never experience again. First, I wanted to join a school club
of my own. Around the same time, an underclassman sought to found a programming
club, and I helped it grow. Although the programming club obviously didn't turn
out the same as the <em>keionbu</em>, I still made new friends there nonetheless.
<em>K-On</em> also inspired me to pick up the guitar so I could lose myself in music
just as the girls did.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em>'s thoughtful themes and genuine depiction of the joys of adolescence
overwhelmed me: I hadn't seen anything like it before, and I recognized that I'd
experienced something truly special. That was when I took notice of KyoAni and
director Naoko Yamada. As one fan puts it, <a href="https://honeysanime.com/the-history-of-kyoto-animation/">"K-On! really started the tradition
that KyoAni titles would tell the stories of normal people in beautiful ways,
something the studio would begin to be known for."</a> In particular, <em>K-On</em>
was the breakout success for Naoko Yamada, the young talent who would become
known for her works centering around adolescence, including the critically
acclaimed film <em>A Silent Voice</em> (which, I might add, was snubbed in favor of
<em>The Boss Baby</em> in the Western-centric and out-of-touch Oscars). <em>K-On</em> is just
one example of KyoAni's work, which are respected for their high production
quality and loved for their often heartfelt subject matter.

    <p>
     The humanity of KyoAni's fiction parallels that of its reality, a rare beacon in
the infamously harsh anime industry. The studio has its own animator training
school, pays its employees a salary instead of per frame, and provides maternity
leave to support its female employees. These conditions pay back as animators
can focus on quality over quantity and KyoAni can maintain in-house talent and
develop its own style. <a href="https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/08/25/the-evolution-of-kyoto-animation-a-unique-anime-studio-and-its-consistent-vision/">KyoAni eventually achieved the financial independence to
run its own production committees so that creators may be in charge of their
works.</a> Not only does KyoAni shine through its anime, it is also a one-of-a-kind in
the anime industry.
    </p>
    <p>
     I remember when I woke up on July 18 and found KyoAni in the international news.
I remember learning the horrific details of the massacre, feeling overwhelmed
by the Western media coverage of varying quality, and getting angry at the
misinformed commentary from unfamiliar outsiders. There couldn't have been a
greater contrast between KyoAni's innocence and its tragedy. I asked: Oh,
KyoAni, why did this have to happen to you?
    </p>
    <p>
     But, I also remember the show of love that KyoAni fans around the world
sent the ravaged studio in the aftermath of the attack. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyoto-animation-fire-money/donations-top-30-million-for-kyoto-animation-arson-victims-in-japan-idUSKBN1YV0MR">KyoAni received $30
million in donations</a> and <a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/15/kyoto-animation-has-a-touchingly-kind-plan-to-distribute-its-3-2-billion-yen-in-arson-donations/">selflessly reserved all the money to compensate the victims and their
families, and none of it for rebuilding the business</a>. Even in the face of death and destruction, KyoAni stood strong with dignity
and compassion. I want to see KyoAni recover and grow and succeed. KyoAni
constantly inspires me to become a kinder person, and countless fans have
personal stories of the studio's positive impact. I hope that even more people
discover the goodness of KyoAni.

     You know, there's a phenomenon where you don't realize who you have to be
thankful for until they're gone. I'm reminded of a certain <em>K-On</em> episode: When
the music room is closed off for repairs, the <em>keionbu</em> must relocate so it can
prepare for its upcoming concert. Unable to practice in their new locations, the
girls brainstorm song ideas instead. When the music room finally reopens, they
realize not to take for granted what they already have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, Yui's doting sister Ui Hirasawa overworks herself caring for Yui and
comes down with a cold. As Ui languidly lies in bed with a fever, Yui endeavors
to repay her sister for her kindness over all the years by preparing a meal,
only to find that cooking is hard! When Ui awakens the next morning, she
discovers Yui fast asleep at her desk with a sheet of lyrics. Yui had stayed up
late writing a new song for the concert devoted to her sister: <em>U&amp;I</em>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      <em>I had thought that it was ordinary to have you by my side</em><br>
<em>I had thought that these days would last forever and ever</em><br>
<em>Sorry, now I realize that these days were extraordinary</em><br>
<em>So first, I need to tell you: "Arigatou!"</em>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Yui Hirasawa, <em>U&amp;I</em>
    </p>
    <p>
     KyoAni, may my feelings reach you: arigatou!

            <h2>
                The <strong>ShiViz</strong> vis­ual­izat­ion engi­ne gene­r­ate­s inter­active comm­uni­ca­tion graphs from dis­tri­but­ed sys­tem exe­cut­ion logs.
            </h2>

            <h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
            <p>
                In the visualization:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>
                        Time flows from top to bottom.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The left panel shows the log and the middle panel displays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> of the partially ordered vector timestamps recorded in the input log.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A vertical line with a box at the top is a <strong>process timeline</strong>. This represents a single thread of execution (e.g., a process).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Circles on a process timeline are <strong>events</strong> that were executed by the process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Diagonal lines connecting two events represent the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happened-before">happened-before</a> relation between the events: the higher of the two events happened <i>before</i> the second event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dashed lines represent transitive communication edges. These only appear when a process is hidden, and two processes that are not hidden communicated indirectly through this process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Larger circles represent merged local events. These have a number inside of them, indicating the number of events that they represent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Radiating lines that fade out represent communication edges to processes that are currently hidden from view.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each process is associated with a unique color. Log entries in the left column have the corresponding process color. By default, the log entries are sorted in the order in which the entries appear in the graph.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            

            <h3>How do I interact with the visualization?</h3>
            <p>
                The visualization supports the following actions:
                </p><ul>
                  <li>
                        <strong>Show process name or event info</strong>
                        <br>
                        Click on a process box or an event circle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hide a process timeline</strong>
                        <br>
                        Click a process box and select "hide". This
                        will remove the process and its timeline from
                        view. You can hide more than one process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Filter by communication to process(es)</strong>
                        <br>
                        Click a process box and select "filter". The
                        graph will be filtered to show only those
                        processes/events that communicate with the
                        filtered process. You can filter by more than
                        one process.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                        <strong>Expand/collapse non-communicating events</strong>
                        <br>
                        ShiViz collapses adjacent process events not
                        incident on any communication edges into
                        larger circles. Click on one of these nodes
                        and select "expand" to undo this collapsing.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Search for keywords or subgraphs</strong>
                        <br>
                        ShiViz supports keyword search across the
                        parsed fields. Search supports logical
                        connectives and regular expressions. You can
                        also search for subgraphs or communication 
                        topologies of interest. You can search for a 
                        pre-defined structure like broadcast
                        or request-response, or you can define and
                        search for a custom structure.
                    </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Show and hide differences between executions</strong>
                        <br>
                        When viewing two executions side-by-side,
                        click on "show differences" to highlight the
                        differences between two executions. Hosts that
                        are not common to both executions are
                        represented as rhombuses. Processes present in
                        both executions have their events compared by
                        the <code>event</code> capture group. Different
                        events are drawn as rhombuses.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <strong>Explore execution clusters</strong>
                        <br>
                        For logs with multiple executions, click on the
                        "clusters" tab to separate executions into 
                        different groups based on a chosen metric.

                        Cluster by the number of processes to group
                        executions by the midpoint between the smallest 
                        and largest number of processes.

                        Cluster by execution comparison to see an overview
                        of how executions differ from a selected base.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <strong>Search for network motifs</strong>
                        <br>
                        Click on the "motifs" tab to find frequently
                        occurring communication patterns within and
                        across executions. Search for 2, 3 or 4-event
                        motifs that occur in at least 50% of the
                        executions or that appear at least 5 times 
                        within a single execution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            

            <h3 id="helpsectiontitle">How is this tool useful?</h3>
            <p>
                Here are four use-cases that ShiViz helps to support:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Understanding the communication graph.</strong>
                        <br>
                        Quickly scan the graph to identify the presence or absence of certain communication patterns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reasoning about ordering in a concurrent or distributed setting</strong>.
                        <br>
                        Visualize concurrency and the happened-before relation to understand if two events occurred concurrently, or if one happened before the other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Analyzing activity at processes that matter</strong>.
                        <br>
                        Hide processes (and their log lines) for a more focused visualization. Filter by communication to a process to see only those events at other processes that were likely to have influenced the execution of a process you care about.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Execution comparison and
                      differencing</strong>
                      <br>
                      Use ShiViz to process logs containing multiple
                      executions. Compare executions pairwise,
                      side-by-side. Use ShiViz to highlight event and
                      host differences between two executions to
                      understand where the executions diverge.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            

            <h3>What is the input log format to the tool?</h3>

            <p>
                You can specify the log format using a regular expression on the Input page. The regular expression must contain the following three named capture groups:
                </p><ul>
                    <li><strong><code>event</code>:</strong> the description of the event</li>
                    <li><strong><code>host</code>:</strong> the name of the process, thread, or host that executed the event</li>
                    <li><strong><code>clock</code>:</strong> the vector clock associated with the event, in JSON format</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                You can also specify other capture groups other than <code>event</code> to capture <em>fields</em> (such as date, IP, priority) which are shown in the sidebar while hovering over an event in the visualization. These fields, unless sub-groups of the <code>event</code> group, will not be displayed as part of the event message.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, for a log entry like:
                </p><pre>28/07/14 01:15 PM Event executed<br>process2 {"process1" : time1, "process2" : time2, ..., "processN" : timeN}</pre><p>

                We might have a parser RegExp like:
                </p><pre>(?&lt;date&gt;\d\d/\d\d/\d\d \d\d:\d\d (AM|PM)) (?&lt;event&gt;.*)\n(?&lt;host&gt;\w+) (?&lt;clock&gt;\{.*\})</pre>
            
            <p>
              The capture groups in ShiViz is not standard regexp
              syntax. We recommend using a plain
              <a href="https://www.debuggex.com/">JS regexp tester</a>
              with regular capture groups to develop expressions, and
              name the capture groups afterwards.
            </p>

            <h3>How can I generate logs to use with ShiViz?</h3>
            <p>
              We developed several ShiViz-compatible vector-clock
              instrumentation <a href="https://distributedclocks.github.io/">libraries</a>
              for C/C++/Java/Go systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, you can study the execution of any system
              that produces logs in a format that can be parsed using
              the RegExp mechanism above.
            </p>

<p>Adapting your language to match that of your audience, in today's world, seems to be growing in importance by the day. Let's contrast two public figures in public appearances that took place yesterday: Fauci vs. Trump.</p>
<h2 id="dr-fauci-vs-populism">Dr Fauci vs Populism</h2>
<p>The rising wave of populism in the U.S has wrought a "distrust of experts". That's a real shame, especially when you don't listen to your infectious disease expert during a Pandemic.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 39.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2039.png"></p>
<p>Dr Fauci literally wrote the book on infectious disease, yet the populists are calling for his head. Why?</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-understand-a-word-he-says">They don't understand a word he says</h3>
<p>I was watching this <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10112108870243761/">interview</a> of Dr Fauci by Zuck, yesterday. Finally Fauci is given a chance to speak to the people. Yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Citizenry"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"myalgic encephalitis"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeling too tired to lift an arm or get out of bed?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"deleterious consequences"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"i used the word 'comparable' and i think it may have been taken out of context"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then don't say 'comparable'.</p>
<p>Indeed we already have evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/09/2008868117">working memory predicts social-distancing compliance</a>. This is pretty damning evidence: essentially people with lower working memory capacity are unwilling to socially distance themselves as they cannot hold enough variables in mind to accurately assess the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Thus it isn't too much of a leap to theorise that a lower working memory capacity is also linked with a restricted vocabulary, and thus a reduced ability to process Dr Fauci's long, complex sentences which are laiden with technical jargon and advanced vocab.</p>
<p>Or to put it bluntly: the idiots don't understand Dr Fauci.</p>
<h2 id="donald-trump-is-a-communication-wizard">Donald Trump is a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Scott Adams accurately predicted <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/10/23/the-case-for-a-trump-landslide-part-1/">Donal Trump would win the elections in a landslide</a> back in 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trump is talking directly to peopleâ€™s subconscious. Everything else he says is just a carrier signal." --Scott Adams (<a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/09/06/how-to-spot-a-wizard/">how to spot a wizard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of Trump's communicative Wizardry. On the same Day Dr Fauci was telling the citizenry about myalgic encephalitis and deleterious consequences, Trump did this:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 40.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2040.png"></p>
<p>Trump had the audacity to set up two cranes, to visually demonstrate lifting regulatory weights off the Republican red truck, while regulation still weighing down on the Democrat blue truck. This is pure communication genius, <strong>because any idiot can understand it</strong> and it <strong>communicates to their subconscious</strong>.</p>
<p>By catering to the lowest common denominator, Trump ensures he captures 100% of his potential base. Not a single word is lost. In fact this kind of visual communication transcends language, education level, even culture.</p>
<h2 id="boris-johnson-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Boris Johnson is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>In this interview, Johnson shares his communication principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"What people listen to are short anglo-saxon words that readily correspond to some object in the universe that they can identify. So in other words: talk simply, in plain English, and talk about stuff in the real world." --Boris Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Deriding people like Trump or Johnson for their perceived linguistic blunders utterly misses the point. <strong>Their blunders are what makes them accessible.</strong> Their simple language is what makes them understable. Their communicative wizardly is what makes them irresistible to their base.</p>
<h2 id="elon-musk-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Elon Musk is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Those who know me will confirm this to you: i have been a huge Musky for a very long time. Elon Musk is yet another genius at tailoring his communication to his base:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 37.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2037.png"></p>
<p>Musk speaks to engineers, or generally a base with technological interests, so his language is not always as simple as it could be. But when you consider the topics he talks about, you have to admire how accessible he is able to make them. The language is simple, and the topics relate to the real world.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 41.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2041.png"></p>
<p>And then there are his masterpieces of communication, like the Tesla he sent into orbit. Once again, pure communication genius that transcends language and culture.</p>
<p>Or his EDM track:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't doubt your vibe, because it's true." -- Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick glance at Tesla's stock performance since the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> will tell you the message was indeed recieved.</p>
<h2 id="idiocracy-had-it-right">Idiocracy had it right</h2>
<p>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/">Idiocracy (2006)</a> is a spooky and hilarious foray into a potential future dumbing down of the human race. The main character, from our time, <strong>who's name is "no sure"</strong> wakes up in the future as the <strong>man with the highest IQ. But nobody understands a word he says</strong>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGUNPMPrxvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>He narrowly manages to save the human race by <strong>showing them</strong> that watering crops with water instead of gatorade is the solution to all their problems.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to dumbing down your language, and communicating visually and symbolically to become an unstoppable communicator. <strong>Think like a scientist and talk like a populist; you will become unstoppable</strong>.</p>
