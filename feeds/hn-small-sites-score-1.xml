<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="entry-summary">On your first day as newly appointed CTO you are working on your hiring strategy, the second day your organization asks you to downsize the team.</p><div><p>A very important project that was a done deal, and that will secure the organization’s future for the next five years, failed to happen.</p><p>Not winning this project meant that the organization was forced to <em>“focus”</em> and reduce costs.</p><p>It never crossed my mind that one of the first things that I would be asked to do as an inexperienced CTO would be to fire part of the team.</p>
<p>when such bad news becomes public, host an open door day where the team can openly talk about the situation, share their feelings, see each other, feel connected, and be listened to. It would not stop the gossiping but it will help.</p><h2>Cuts and team principles</h2><p>The Dev team slice of the <em>“focus”</em> meant cutting cost by 10 to 15%. In human terms, firing two to four people (out of 17).</p><p>After some failed attempts to approach this task, this is what worked for me.</p><p>I started by listing some principles: </p>
<ul>
  <li>For each product, we need to cover the following disciplines: Frontend, Backend, Architecture, Operations, Mobile, UX, Design, QA, Leadership, and Product Management.</li>
  <li>There are broadly 3 experience levels:
  <ul>
    <li>Senior: creates the plan.</li>
    <li>Mid-level: follows the plan.</li>
    <li>Junior: needs to be taught to follow the plan.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>No number of junior people can do some work a senior person can do.</li>
  <li>Not having a senior person in a discipline will mean that the product quality will suffer:
  <ul>
    <li>If a senior creates a plan, a team of mid-level+juniors can follow the plan for some time (2-3 years?) before the product becomes a big mess.</li>
    <li>To get out of a big mess, we need senior people.
    <ul>
      <li>We are already in a big mess with Product A and Product B.</li>
      <li>With the current team, it feels Product A is getting out of the mess.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Independent (cross-functional) teams are more efficient:
  <ul>
    <li>More focus.</li>
    <li>No handoffs, faster feedback.</li>
    <li>No shared “resource” contention.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>People working in multiple products/teams are less efficient.</li>
  <li>Multidisciplinary (generalist) people:
  <ul>
    <li>Can cover the need for several of the disciplines.</li>
    <li>They can be junior in one discipline and senior in another.</li>
    <li>Allow focusing on any priority, without creating artificially important work for single-disciplined members.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Max team size: 2 pizza teams 6-8.</li>
</ul><p>The ideal team would be one that has all disciplines covered at a senior level with multidisciplinary people working in just one team, and with enough overlap to avoid a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> of one. Additional people will bring additional capacity.</p><h2>Inverse Conway’s maneuver</h2><p>We have been working on bringing three of the products together for some time. They were already under the same product manager, but they were still three teams working on their own priorities. Merging them into one team, in a classic <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2020/01/08/do-i-need-a-gateway-api-team-dynamics/#content">inverse Conway’s maneuver</a> would hopefully accelerate the integration between the products.</p><p>One of the other products was small enough that for this task I decided to temporarily ignore it.</p><p>Following the principles above and the product considerations, the plan was to move the previous team setup from:</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day2/old-team-structure.jpg" alt="old team structure"> </p><p>To something like (boxes represent skills, not people):</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day2/new-team-structure.jpg" alt="new team structure"> </p><p>So two products, two cross-functional teams. Platforms and design teams will be reshuffled inside those two teams.</p><h2>Which parent do you love most? A computer will tell</h2><p>With a clear plan for the team, the next step was to <em>“just”</em> pick up who will work on each team, and who we will need to let go. The most painful decision in my career. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://danlebrero.com/2019/11/27/becoming-a-technical-leader-book-notes/#content">People with a strong technical background can convert any task into a technical task, thus avoiding work they don’t want to do.</a> <cite>Jerry Weinberg, Becoming a Technical Leader</cite></p>
</blockquote><p>And I didn’t want to do the task so, consciously ignoring Mr. Weinberg, I transformed the ordeal into an optimization problem, for which I wrote an application to help me with.</p><h3>The app</h3><p>The application took as input the amount of $$$ to cut, the list of people, their salary, and the skill level on each discipline mentioned above, and outputted the possible two teams that would be within budget and match the minimum requirements, sorted by a scoring system.</p><p>The minimum requirements and scoring system configuration looked like:</p>
<pre><code>{
"FE" [at-least-senior sum-skills]
"PM" [senior-plus-somebody-else (fix-points 5)]
"Design" [two-mid-or-senior (senior-better 6 2)]
...
}
</code></pre><p>The first function filters out invalid teams while the second scores the valid ones.</p><p>In the example we say that the team has to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least one senior FE developer. The more FE developers, the better team score.</li>
  <li>At least one senior product manager and one mid or junior one. Only one senior is not enough. No matter how many PMs the team has, the score for this discipline is 5. A team with loads of FE devs will score higher than one with loads of PMs.</li>
  <li>At least a senior designer or two mid-level designers, but we prefer one senior designer (6 points) instead of two mid-level ones (2 points).</li>
</ul><h3>The result</h3><p>As heartless as this may seem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It removed some bias. There is still bias on the skill level evaluation and in the team scoring system.</li>
  <li>I was part of the people on that list. To be honest, little consolation here. Big bias.</li>
  <li>It forced me to be very very precise on what a “functioning team” meant.</li>
  <li>It allowed me to see what different scoring systems would output.</li>
  <li>I noticed some people would never show in the output, and had to dig into why. It was enlightening.</li>
  <li>It allowed me to analyze tens of thousands of different team combinations, with different scoring systems.</li>
  <li>Programming gave me a respite from the task. This was the first time, but now I embrace more regularly “keep my sanity” programming days.</li>
</ul><p>Most important, the application gave me a few starting points. Of those, I still had to consider the team dynamics, existing teams, personalities, seniority, potential, personal situation, future needs, …</p>
<p>yes, I still have the code. No, I am not going to share it publicly. It would kill me to find there is a bug.</p><h2>Delivering the bad news</h2><p>Once the decision was made, it was time to swallow the last bitter pill.</p><p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the people affected are the first ones to know.</li>
  <li>Warn beforehand:
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use your regular one-to-one meeting slot.</li>
    <li>In your message, give a strong hint: “HR person will be in the meeting”, “Really bad news”.</li>
    <li>Give them time to get ready for the meeting.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You don’t need to do it alone. Our HR manager was present and was a huge support for both of us.</li>
  <li>Treat people like adults.</li>
  <li>At the meeting, follow Nadia van der Vlies’ <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2020/04/01/no-nonsense-leadership-summary/#bad-news">advice</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Deliver the blow:
    <ul>
      <li>Go straight to the bad news.</li>
      <li>Give one or two reasons.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Manage the reaction:
    <ul>
      <li>Be understanding. Do not justify yourself.</li>
      <li>Give space. Do not fill silences.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Solution, explanation, follow-up appointment:
    <ul>
      <li>Wait for the employee to be ready. When she starts asking “why” or “what now”.</li>
      <li>Reiterate reasons.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>In a couple of days follow up with another more informal meeting. The news would have sunk, and the conversation would be more forward-thinking and productive.</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>A slap in the face to awaken me from the dream that a CTO role is mostly about technology.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/erporydxmaarwcd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I recently found this piece of art (LINES 2A (2017)) created by <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerxhobbs">Tyler Hobbs</a>. This picture kinda looked very hand drawn, but it’s completely generative. Something about this drawing and it’s texture kind of resonated with me, so I wanted to try to study and replicate (or make something inspired by this work) using p5js.</p>

<p>I started out by plotting a bunch of random points within a circle like so.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>w = 1000
function setup() {
  createCanvas(w, w);
  background('#F9F8F4');
}

function draw() {
  x = random(w)
  y = random(w)
  if (pow(w/2 - x, 2) + pow(w/2 - y, 2) &lt; 7e4) {
    point(x,y)
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-25.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a painfully slow process to generate random points in a circle. I found a better way to do this later. What I wanted to do next was to generate flow fields, but restricted to the circular region.</p>

<p>It’s super easy to generate flow field patterns using perlin noise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose a random point <code>&lt;x,y&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Plot <code>&lt;x,y&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Calculate <code>n = noise(x,y)</code></li>
  <li>Do <code>x+=cos(n * 2 * PI)</code> and <code>y+=sin(n * 2 * PI)</code></li>
  <li>Repeat 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re going to plot flow fields inside the circle. Let’s try this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const is_in_circle = (x, y) =&gt; 
  (pow(w / 2 - x, 2) + pow(w / 2 - y, 2) &lt; 7e4)

function draw() {
  if (is_in_circle(x = random(w), y = random(w)))
    while (is_in_circle(x, y)) {
      n = noise(x, y)
      x += sin(n * TAU)
      y += cos(n * TAU)
      point(x, y)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-28.png" alt=""></p>

<p>OK, not very good. The noise at this level is pretty rough. we’re going to zoom in to the noise function (by dividing the <code>x,y</code> inputs by some constant value) and probably use <code>circle(x ,y ,0.3)</code> to plot points instead if point function, because I feel it looks way smoother. Also, I’m adding a <code>random() &gt; 0.01</code> condition in the loop so that we also get short lines that are not trimmed away by the edge of the circle.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function draw() {
  if (is_in_circle(x = random(w), y = random(w)))
    while (is_in_circle(x, y) &amp;&amp; random() &gt; 0.01) {
      n = noise(x / 500, y / 500)
      x += sin(n * TAU)
      y += cos(n * TAU)
      circle(x, y, .3)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-27.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Actually.. not bad. I think we manage almost replicate the original texture. The inverted version also looks pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-19.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/ppanets.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="going-further-animations">Going Further: Animations</h2>

<p>The code we wrote right now technically is animated. The animation however is not very smooth.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_03-52-31.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>To make smooth animations, we need to generate new points in the circle, keep track of these points outside the <code>draw()</code> function. I found this neat <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50746409">technique</a>, to find random points in a circle where a random radius <code>r</code> and angle <code>theta</code> are chosen and the <code>x,y</code> points are obtained as <code>x = centerX + r * cos(theta)</code> and <code>y = centerY + r * sin(theta)</code></p>

<p>Let’s try that first.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function random_point() {
  r = random(w / 4)
  t = random(TAU)
  return [
    w/2 + cos(t) * r, 
    w/2 + sin(t) * r
  ]
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas((w = 1e3), w);
  background(255)
  k = w / 2
  m = (Array(w).fill(0)).map(random_point)
}

function draw() {
  for (i = k; --i;) {
    [x, y] = m[i]
    circle(x, y, .3);
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-01-10-04-51-20.png" alt=""></p>

<p>and now we apply flow fields and try to move these points.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function random_point() {
  r = random(w / 4)
  t = random(TAU)
  return [
    w/2 + cos(t) * r, 
    w/2 + sin(t) * r
  ]
}

const w = 1000
function setup() {
  createCanvas(w, w);
  background('#F9F8F4')
  k = w / 2
  points = (Array(k).fill(0)).map(random_point)
}

function draw() {
  for (i = k; --i;) {
    [x, y] = m[i]
    x += sin(n = noise(x / 400, y / 400) * TAU) * h
    y += cos(n) * h
    stroke(i%255)
    circle(x, y,.3)
    if (pow(k - x, 2) + pow(k - y, 2) &lt; 7e4)  // if point is in circle
      points[i] = [x, y, t]
    else points[i] = random_point() // replace with new point if not
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a つぶやきProcessing version of course..</p>

<h2 id="adding-colors">Adding Colors</h2>

<p>There are many strategies to colorizing this sketch. One is by just giving each particle a random initial color.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-21.png" alt=""></p>

<p>However, I found that maintaining the initial x or y position in the particle array and using that to derive the hue information gives us some nice Jupiter/gaseous planet vibes.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_05-18-19.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>The fringing at the sides can be avoided by moving 50% of the points in the reverse direction.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_08-43-25.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>More color variations</p>

<p>And that’s it. Hope this was educational!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apparently, I've got a theme going of Weird Syntax. Let's run with it.</p>

<p>Konrad Zuse was an early pioneer in computer science, although his name is perhaps somewhat less well-known than others. Zuse holds the honor of having built the first programmable computer—-the Z3—-back in the 40's, as well as several other computing firsts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>. Of particular interest to this blog post is his early unimplemented programming language, Plankalkül.</p>

<p>Plankalkül was, like the Z3, in many respects ahead of its time. Zuse's explicit goal was to be able to describe programs at a high level, which meant he included control structures and datatype definitions<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup> and other high-level constructs that were often missing in languages of the early years of computing. Zuse was working on Plankalkül at a time when his machines were not useable, which meant that his language work was more theoretical than it was technical, and consequently he allowed features that he wasn't entirely sure how to program. Despite his notes on it having been written in the mid-40's, they were not published until the 70's, and it was not implemented until the year 2000.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me, as I read programs in this notation that had been set down on a typewriter<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>, is that certain kinds of grouping were handled by explicit indication of scope: not via matched delimiters as in ALGOL-style languages, or via indentation in languages such as Python and Haskell, but by formatting the code so that a line bordered on the left of the scoped parts of the code:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/static/zuse-01.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is meant to capture the way grouping works in the hand-written or typeset notation, with brackets spanning multiple lines:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/static/zuse-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I think this is notationally interesting: it's like Python's significant whitespace, but not, uh, whitespace. It would be incredibly tedious to type out, but still entirely compatible with current programming notation:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 | @staticmethod
 | def new_tet()
 |  | n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 |  | for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 |  |  | if p in Board.permanent
 |  |  |  | Game.lose()
 |  | Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 |
 | def __init__(self, points, color)
 |  | self.points = points
 |  | self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>and would be entirely amenable to beautifying via judicious application of Unicode:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 ┃ @staticmethod
 ┃ def new_tet()
 ┃  ┃ n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 ┃  ┃ for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 ┃  ┃  ┃ if p in Board.permanent
 ┃  ┃  ┗  ┗ Game.lose()
 ┃  ┗ Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 ┃
 ┃ def __init__(self, points, color)
 ┃  ┃ self.points = points
 ┃  ┗ self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at this notation, however, an interesting possibility struck me: a programmer could explicit annotate information about the <em>kind of scope</em> involved in a given line. In this Python-like example, I could, for example, distinguish class scope using double lines, function scope with thick lines, and control structure scope with thin lines:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 ║ @staticmethod
 ║ def new_tet()
 ║  ┃ n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 ║  ┃ for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 ║  ┃  │ if p in Board.permanent
 ║  ┃  └  └ Game.lose()
 ║  ┗ Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 ║
 ║ def __init__(self, points, color)
 ║  ┃ self.points = points
 ║  ┗ self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage of this scheme is that a handful of lines, viewed in isolation, still give you a clear view of what surrounds them. For example, I can view these two lines in isolation and still tell that they are within a control structure used within a function declared within a class:</p>

<pre><code> ║  ┃  │ if p in Board.permanent
 ║  ┃  └  └ Game.lose()
</code></pre>

<p>You could also imagine a hypothetical language in which choice of scope delimiter is important. In Python, <code>for</code> and <code>if</code> do not form a new lexical scope. What if instead we could stipulate the kind of scope they form by this notational convention?</p>

<pre><code>def okay()
 ┃ if True
 ┃  └ n = 5   # n is declared in function scope
 ┗ return n   # n leaks out of the if-scope

def not_okay()
 ┃ if True
 ┃  ┗ n = 5   # n is declared in the if's scope
 ┗ return n   # error: no n in scope here
</code></pre>

<p>That being said, there are a number of reasons that this notation is in inferior to existing notations:</p>
<ul><li>It makes refactoring code <em>much</em> more difficult.</li>
<li>It requires that the programmer <em>pay attention</em> to the sequence of enclosing scopes on a <em>line-by-line</em> basis, which is generally too pedantic and not particularly useful for a programmer.</li>
<li>The ability to select “which kind of scope” is by no means only expressible by this notation, as other syntactic features such as keywords and delimiters could express the same thing.</li>
<li>There are only so many line-like characters which can serve as a scope marker, so this scheme is not very extensible.</li>
<li>It complicates parsing (especially by introducing an entirely new class of parse errors in which adjacent lines feature incompatible sequences of delimiting lines), and so it also...</li>
<li>Complicates parse <em>error messages</em>, which are an important part of a language's UI and should be considered seriously.</li></ul>

<p>So, as in my previous post on <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/2014/8/noun-case" rel="nofollow">grammatical case in programming languages</a>, I urge readers <em>not</em> to use this notation as the concrete syntax for a programming language. This is merely an entertaining peek through the looking glass at a curious notational convention which was never adopted.</p>

<p>That said: this makes a very nice notation for <em>viewing</em> code, where the programmer does not have to explicitly draw ASCII art around their code; indeed, it bears more than a passing similarity to the graphical interface used in <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Scratch</a>, and Sean McDirmid's <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liveprogramming/typography.aspx" rel="nofollow">Experiments in Code Typography</a> features this very convention as an interactive ornament on code in a Python-like language.</p>

<p>Instead of Gekko, why not use for instance Python, or R, or GAMS, or MATLAB, or SAS, or Excel, or … ?</p>
<p>Software packages are typically aimed at some purpose, and this is reflected in, among other things, the underlying data structures and the syntax of the command language.</p>
<p>Since Gekko is timeseries-oriented, the syntax for handling and analyzing timeseries and timeseries-based models is concise and natural. Gekko does not try to do everything, but tries to focus on its strong points, while simultaneously providing good interfaces to other software packages.</p>

			<p><span>H</span>umans once lived in harmony with the natural world. Consider timekeeping. Until relatively recently, the human notion of time was based on the natural rhythms of nature. Time was measured by a new moon, the first snow, a migrating bird, or the ebb and flow of a river. Time meant situating ourselves as part of a larger web of life.</p><p>Western society has since lost its connection to nature. Human-created days, hours, minutes, seconds meticulously dictate our lives. Our sense of time is now detached from the world around us. Modern clocks provide many important services by establishing predictability in a complex and fast-paced world. But the loss of our interconnectivity with nature’s timekeepers has diminished our relationship with nature.</p><figure data-alt="Wilson_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18075_0bbe3f9c489c409d1d6e229ccd23ab00.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>OF TIME AND THE RIVER:</strong> The Anchorage Museum displays “Alaska River Time,” an art project by Jonathon Keats, which uses the natural flow of a river as a timekeeping standard.

Many elements of Western society treat humans as separate from and superior to the natural world. Nature was once perceived as living—even sacred. Now it is treated as a human commodity. Under Western legal systems, humans possess rights while the rest of nature does not. Entire cities have been built over once wondrous ecosystems that we sparsely acknowledge. Few people realize that entombed rivers still flow invisibly below cities such as New York, London, and Paris. Nature is still here, but it is often subjugated and ignored.<br></p><p>We can reclaim our deep relationship with nature, essential to solving the environmental crisis. It begins with two movements: cultural and legal. The cultural one arises from artists, writers, and other creatives whose work reshapes our thinking by underscoring that humans are part of nature, not separate from it. The legal one involves harmonizing human laws with the laws of the Earth. This means rewriting the legal system so it represents nature’s rights and interests directly alongside our own. A new generation of “Earth lawyers,” including me, have taken up this challenging task.</p><p><span>T</span>he illusion of separation between humans and nature began about 11,000 years ago, when the first agriculture-based societies emerged. From 800 to 300 B.C., philosophers and religions began to champion human superiority and dominion over nature. Scientists like Francis Bacon and philosophers like René Descartes popularized their conceptions of Earth as a machine or giant clock that was possible to control and exploit as long as we pulled the right levers.</p><p>Midway through the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution catalyzed the development of an economic system that viewed nature as a form of natural capital rather than a life source. New economic paradigms encouraged industry to incessantly exploit nature to fuel monetary growth without limits. Modern democracy and human rights also emerged during this period, but they focused on the well-being of individuals rather than the larger community of life. In accordance with the dominant systems of law and economics, society came to normalize the separation of humans and nature.</p><blockquote><p>The law establishes a legal duty for humans to protect and restore ecosystems to health because that is their right.</p> </blockquote><p>The next period, from post-World War II through the present, is sometimes called the “Great Acceleration.” Measures of human growth and impact, such as population, GDP, water and energy use, ocean acidification, and forest loss, began to increase nearly exponentially during this time.<sup>1</sup> New economic policies commodified nearly all aspects of life, including air, water, forests, countless plant and animal species, and food, among others. Corporations began to exploit unprotected ecosystems until they reached total collapse. Consumerism became a way of life.<br></p><p>We have killed off 68 percent of vertebrate animal populations over the last 50 years.<sup>2</sup> Nearly one in six species faces extinction due to climate change.<sup>3</sup> Humans felled 46 percent of all trees, as well as 20 percent of the Amazon in the last 50 years alone.<sup>4</sup> We destroyed half of the world’s coral reefs and are well on our way to a world where they are totally wiped out.<sup>5</sup> Humans suffer, as well, from the precipitous decline of nature. Some 7 million humans die each year due to air pollution, including 100,000 annually in the United States.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p><p><span>A</span>lthough most of the world largely continues with business as usual, a growing number of governments have embraced cutting-edge legal solutions that would allow humans to live in harmony with nature.</p><p>One of the most promising legal solutions is “rights of nature.” It recognizes that nature is a “legal entity” or “persons” with fundamental rights. This movement received global attention when Ecuador recognized the rights of nature in its 2008 Constitution. Now, rights of nature is recognized in some 12 countries through a combination of national and local legislation, landmark court decisions, treaty agreements, and other legal developments.</p><div>

</div><p>Rights of nature corrects shortcomings of modern environmental laws. Environmental laws operate as a tourniquet, creating rules to prevent nature’s loss but doing little to address root causes—such as an economy that incentivizes the maximum exploitation of nature for profit. By contrast, rights of nature establishes a legal duty for humans to protect and restore ecosystems to health because that is their right.</p><p>The rights of nature, although still in its early stages, is gaining momentum. In 2017, the Constitutional Court of Colombia declared the Atrato River—one of Colombia’s largest rivers—to be a “subject of rights,” with rights to protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration. The Court also created a guardianship body to serve as the voice of the river, just as a child might have a legal guardian. Finally, the Court ordered state authorities to create a plan—a blueprint is in the works—to decontaminate waterways in the Atrato River basin, to end illegal mining, and take other actions to uphold the rights of rivers.</p><blockquote><p>Two forces, law and culture, will converge to create transformative change. In the meantime, go meet your local river.</p> </blockquote><p>In New Zealand, the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017 recognized the Whanganui River as a living entity and legal person, solidifying a 2012 treaty agreement between the Whanganui Iwi (a Maori tribe) and New Zealand’s crown government. It establishes a guardianship body to promote the river’s health and well-being and serve as its “human face.” Already, the legislation is being put into practice. In 2020, a new governance structure for a port revitalization project on the Whanganui River announced that the river’s indivisible nature and the community’s collective obligation to benefit the river will guide its decision-making.<sup>7</sup><br></p><p>There are other instances of ecosystems being recognized as having rights or personhood. In 2019, the highest court in Bangladesh recognized the rights of all rivers and instituted a plan to address illegal river encroachment. In the United States, the Klamath and Snake Rivers are recognized as having rights by the Yurok and Nez Perce Tribes, respectively. In Mexico, three states have amended their constitutions to recognize the rights of nature, and lawmakers in Oaxaca, Mexico, are proposing to establish the rights of rivers and create a robust legal guardianship body for implementation.</p><p>Granting legal rights to nature could become society’s next major rights-based milestone as part of a larger movement toward the implementation of “Earth law” (like “human rights law” but for the planet). Establishing the rights of nature is an essential piece of the solution to the ecological crisis.</p><p><span>N</span>ot only does the rights of nature give ecosystems a voice in our legal system, it influences our culture. In the case of the Whanganui River, tens of thousands of people have learned how the Maori tribes that live along the Whanganui treat the river as their ancestor and see themselves as its guardians. Numerous global gatherings have celebrated the Whanganui River and other waterways that are now “persons.” A 2019 law journal article in <i>Ecology Law Quarterly</i> writes metaphorically about the “songs” of the Whanganui river and others—songs that are sad, discordant, muted, loving, trusting, or inspiring—and suggests to its predominantly legal readers, “Let us sit beside the river and wait patiently for its song.”<sup>7</sup> A new mindset is emerging in which humans learn to listen to and guard rivers rather than exploit them. The law influences culture, and culture influences the law.</p><p>Many varieties of cultural changes will accelerate the legal movement toward rights of nature. We can reinvent our language so that we no longer describe nature as our “property” or a “resource,” but rather refer to nature as persons, family members, kin, or co-inhabitants of the planet. Movies, songs, TV shows, books, and other artworks that showcase nature being alive and having its own rights can galvanize culture and will help fuel legal battles.</p><p>Timekeeping, too, can become part of the cultural movement toward the rights of nature. Specifically, we can create new standards of time that recognize our deep relationship with the natural world. Experimental philosopher, artist, and writer <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/79/catalysts/philosophy-is-a-public-service" target="_blank">Jonathon Keats</a> has collaborated with the Anchorage Museum to create <a href="http://alaskarivertime.org/" target="_blank">Alaska River Time</a>, which uses the natural flow of a river as a timekeeping standard.

Dominguez / CERN</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>I</span>n a recent experiment done at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, in Germany, physicist Alexey Grinin and his colleagues came a step closer to resolving one of the more significant puzzles to have arisen in particle physics over the past decade. The puzzle is this: Ordinarily, when you set about measuring the size of something, you’d expect to get the same answer no matter what you use to measure it—a soda can has the diameter it does whether you measure it with a tape measure or callipers (provided these are properly calibrated, of course). Something must be amiss if your attempts to measure the can return different answers depending on the equipment, yet this is precisely what’s happened over multiple attempts to measure the spatial extent of a proton. What’s potentially at stake is our understanding of the building blocks of reality: the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1061.abstract" target="_blank">differing measurements</a> could be heralding the existence of new forces or particles.</p><p>What does it mean for a subatomic particle to have a measurable “size”? Mathematically, fundamental particles are idealized as point particles, which is to say that, as far as we can tell, they have no meaningfully discernible spatial extent, or substructure, at all. True, all fundamental particles are associated with a quantum mechanical wave packet, which does have a spatial extent that depends on the energy of the particle. Yet these basic bits of Lego are entities whose wave packets you can, in principle, pack into as small a region as you’d like before the very notion of continuum geometry starts, at the Planck scale, to lose meaning. Fundamental particles organize into something analogous to a mini periodic table—consisting of the various force carrying particles, such as photons and gluons (the carrier particles of the strong nuclear force), along with three generations of quarks and leptons and the mass-generating Higgs boson—and can stack together in different combinations to form a zoo of so-called composite particles.</p><blockquote><p>There is less than one in about a trillion chance that the discrepancy could be a statistical fluke.</p> </blockquote><p>Perhaps the most familiar and ubiquitous of these is the proton. With at least one in every kind of element, it’s made up of two up quarks and a down quark that dance around each other in a tightly bound orbit maintained by exchanging gluons. This exchange process is so energetic that most of the mass of the proton (or for that matter, most of the material that makes us up) derives from the energy contained in these gluons—a consequence, as Einstein informed us, of <i>E</i> being equal to <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;<br></p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18083_78b8d6620afcd434a4b7fb41b22e595b.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>Fundamental particles organize into something analogous to a mini periodic table (above).</i></span><span>CERN</span></figcaption></figure><p>So it’s not meaningless to ask what the “size” of the proton is. The study by Grinin’s team highlights the fact that defining this notion remains a rather tricky affair. And, as we’ll see, their results serve to sharpen the mystery as to why other measurement methods researchers have used previously disagree.<br></p><p>A physicist can reasonably infer a proton’s size from the “charge radius”—roughly the averaged spatial extent of quark orbits inside. This quantity is probed in slightly different ways by electrons and muons (another sort of fundamental particle), when you probe their orbital configurations as they form “bound states” with the proton—atomic hydrogen in the case of electrons, muonic hydrogen in the case of muons. Because muons are about 200 times heavier than electrons, their lowest energy orbital configurations are much more tightly bound around the proton than are electrons in atomic hydrogen. Consequently, the differences in the energies of various orbitals in muonic hydrogen are much more sensitive to the proton’s size as well as being more “high pitched” than that of regular atomic hydrogen.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, similar to how plucking a guitar string at a given tension produces a much higher note were we to fret it open, or at 1/200th its open length, the typical frequencies of the radiation emitted by transitions in muonic hydrogen are about 200 times higher than that in atomic hydrogen. These frequencies relate to something called the Rydberg constant—the tension of the guitar string in the analogy—which appears to be one of the potentially more significant sources of uncertainty proton size-wise. Orbital energy levels depend on both this constant and the charge radius of the proton.</p><p>Proton-size measurements didn’t conflict for decades. Different methods—like measuring the radius by observing electrons orbit within hydrogen atoms, or by scattering energetic electrons off of unbound protons—had converged on a value of 0.875 (give or take 0.006) femtometers. That’s a little less than a trillionth of a millimeter. That convergence was disrupted in 2010, when a paper came out titled, “The size of the proton.” As the researchers reported, <a href="http://www.quantum.physik.uni-potsdam.de/teaching/ss2015/pqt/Pohl2010.pdf" target="_blank">measurements</a> involving orbital configurations in muonic hydrogen returned a value of 0.842, give or take 0.001 femtometers. This may not seem like much of a difference, but it’s the accompanying error bars that matter. The measurements are, individually, so precise that their disagreement is over seven standard deviations—there is less than one in about a trillion chance that the discrepancy could be a statistical fluke.</p><p>There are only two possibilities for the anomalous result if the equipment used in the experiments and their calibrations all check out after careful scrutiny. Either some combination of physical constants, which researchers assume in order to experimentally infer the proton charge radius, isn’t known as accurately as we thought, or there is something different about the way muons interact with protons, compared to electrons, that renders particle physics incomplete.</p><p>The latter possibility, if substantiated, would, of course, cause a flurry of excitement among theoretical physicists to say the least, as it could imply the existence of new forces and particles. Not only would it reshape our understanding of the universe, it would represent a throwback to the days when physicists discovered particles (<a href="https://timeline.web.cern.ch/anderson-and-neddermeyer-discover-muon" target="_blank">such as the muon itself</a>) using equipment that could fit on a proverbial tabletop.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>Over the past few years, various teams have been attempting to get to the bottom of the matter by looking at different orbital transitions in atomic hydrogen that are sensitive to different combinations of the Rydberg constant and the charge radius. A 2019 <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/1007" target="_blank">measurement</a> by a group of researchers at York University in Canada looked at a particular orbital transition that was independent of the value of this constant, finding a value of 0.833 ± 0.010 femtometers, consistent with the smaller value obtained in muonic hydrogen.&nbsp;</p><p>Grinin’s team went a step further. They used a technique known as frequency comb spectroscopy. It involves pulses of laser light that are a superposition of equally spaced frequencies—a ruler in frequency space if you will—that allowed them to look at two different orbital transitions in atomic hydrogen sensitive to two different combinations of the proton size and the Rydberg constant. This permitted them to determine both with unprecedented accuracy. The technique reduced, to only about one part in ten trillion, the observational uncertainties in the frequency of light these transitions emitted—a staggering degree of accuracy by any standard.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did Grinin’s team find a value for the charge radius of the proton consistent with the value obtained in muonic hydrogen, they inferred a much more precise value for the Rydberg constant. This accounted for some part of the discrepancy seen in other measurements in atomic hydrogen (which presumed a less accurate value).</p><p>It thus appears that the experimental value of the proton charge radius Grinin’s team obtained in atomic hydrogen is converging on the smaller values for the proton charge radius other researchers initially obtained in muonic hydrogen. The smaller value has by now even been adopted as the <a href="https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rp" target="_blank">official value</a> on the National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/codata-values-fundamental-physical-constants" target="_blank">CODATA</a> list of recommended physical constants—the official almanac for nuclear and atomic chemists and physicists.&nbsp;</p><p>Although this convergence, based on the continued refinement of experimental techniques, did not deliver the new physics some may have been hoping for, even the most despondent theoretical physicist can acknowledge the experimental artistry that seems to be bringing the matter closer to conclusion. What remains unresolved is the reason why measurements, relying on different spectroscopic methods in atomic hydrogen, return different values for the charge radius of the proton. The mystery, and along with it, the diminishing hope of particle physicists, endures for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p>This was enough motivation for a team of theoretical physicists, led by Cliff Burgess at the Perimeter Institute, in Canada, to systematically catalogue all possible sources of theoretical uncertainty in atomic spectroscopy over a <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&amp;size=25&amp;page=1&amp;q=find%20a%20burgess,%20c%20and%20a%20zalavari" target="_blank">series of papers</a>. By isolating the ways in which new forces and particles might leave a tell-tale signature, they’ve thrown the gauntlet firmly back to the experimentalists. Future experiments, as always, will be the ultimate arbiter in this matter.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Subodh Patil is an assistant professor at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at Leiden University.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>I thought I would publish a post each month about what is happening with my <a href="https://github.com/alex-dukhno/database">database</a> project, but it turns out it requires more time and energy to do so <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> Thus I will try to summarise my experience of developing a relational database and how it went in 2020 in this post.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-or-brief-history-of-my-journey">TL;DR or brief history of my journey</h2>

<p>I realize that I want to work on databases and SQL engines somewhere around the end of 2018. I didn’t know what to do except that to come up with a list of existing technologies with SQL capabilities and send my CV to companies that support and develop them. Most of them are open-source projects. At the end of 2019, I decided to try to contribute a code to some of them. One of the projects was <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast">Hazelcast</a>. I was invited to hiring interviews after a couple of months of contribution and joined the company on 3rd February of 2020. I have joined the Management Center team that develops a web-based product that manages Hazelcast clusters, reports metrics, and other functionality. Git history of <a href="https://github.com/alex-dukhno/database">database</a> project says that the first commit was on 20th April 2020. I have learned a lot about the internals of SQL engines since that time. There were many obstacles and problems I had to analyze and solve. That helped me gain invaluable experience. At some point, I realized how much I love developing these complicated “engineering beasts” and how web-based applications don’t motivate me to work. At the end of October, I decided to talk about this with my manager. That resulted in me joining the Hazelcast core subteam that works on a distributed SQL engine starting from 1st January 2021. That doesn’t mean I will stop working on my database project - it is the opposite. Now I have more time to gain experience in developing SQL engines.</p>

<p>For the rest of this post, I describe how my perception of what the SQL engine is and how it works changes over the year.</p>

<h2 id="sql-over-b-tree">SQL over B-Tree</h2>

<p>To get somehow started working on the database, I decided that it will be <a href="https://alex-dukhno.github.io/2017-05-17-There-is-just-no-just-in-software-development/">just</a> a <a href="https://github.com/ballista-compute/sqlparser-rs">sql parser</a> and a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html">BTreeMap</a>. If the database receives an insert statement, it invokes <code>BTreeMap#insert</code>. If it receives an update statement, it invokes <code>BTreeMap#get</code> and then <code>BTreeMap#insert</code>. If it receives a delete statement, it invokes <code>BTreeMap#remove</code>. If it receives a select statement, it invokes <code>BTreeMap#values</code>. What could be easier than that, right?</p>

<p>After I typed in <code>BTreeMap</code> I realize that it had to be over some keys and values and couldn’t be generic of some <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> because I couldn’t know what tables users could create at runtime. So I decided to support only <code>i32</code> keys and values. It didn’t take me much to write code to see my idea works. Something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>stmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqlparser</span><span>::</span><span>Parser</span><span>::</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>"insert into t values(1)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>process</span><span>(</span><span>stmt</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>stmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqlparser</span><span>::</span><span>Parser</span><span>::</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>"select * from t"</span><span>);</span>
<span>print_selected_data</span><span>(</span><span>stmt</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="server-and-other-parts">Server and other parts</h2>

<p>The next was … client. I knew that it would be hard to develop two applications: client and server, and even harder to develop a communication protocol between them, so I decided: “Ok, let database implements <code>PostgreSQL</code> wire protocol, and I could use <code>psql</code> for testing” Sounds easier than done… I spent a couple of days googling a simple example of server-side implementation of a <code>PostgreSQL</code> wire protocol. All databases that I knew implement protocol incorporated it so much in their query execution flow that I couldn’t understand what is what and why it all was needed. That is why I decided to build a rust crate for easier server-side implementations of the protocol. First, it lived as a cargo module, but after six months and a lot of contribution from <a href="https://github.com/silathdiir">Steven</a>, I decided to give it a go and extract it into a separate <a href="https://github.com/alex-dukhno/pg_wire">pg_wire</a> crate.</p>

<h2 id="types">Types</h2>

<p><code>PostgreSQL</code> wire protocol supports two modes of passing queries between client and server: <code>Simple</code> and <code>Extended</code>. In the <code>Simple</code> mode, a client sends a query as a string, and the server processes it. In the <code>Extended</code> mode, the client and server exchange messages. They do so to figure out what variable parameters the client uses, what their types are, and so on. The database should have a type system to support the <code>Extended</code> mode. And I have to tell you it is much interesting to watch how your database can handle not only <code>insert into table_name values (1);</code> but also <code>insert into table_name values ('here a string');</code>. After that <code>BTreeMap</code> was transformed from <code>BTreeMap&lt;i32, i32&gt;</code> into <code>BTreeMap&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;</code>. I used a <code>|</code> symbol to separate column values. Map values were split by <code>|</code> and transformed into plain <code>String</code>s - thank God <code>PostgreSQL</code> wire protocol supports text and binary communication between client and server <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-query-execution-pipeline">What is a query execution pipeline?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in the topic of databases you probably read from books, articles, or watched presentations from conferences then you probably know that before executing a query a database does parsing, analysis, optimizing, building a plan for the query, and only then executes it. As I moving along in my database development these phases emerged. In the beginning, it was parsing and executing phases. Then I wanted to do more interesting <code>select</code>s with <code>where</code> clause, I realized that the database has to build some sort of query plan: what columns to select from which table and how to filter data that is not needed. At that time the database had intertwined plan and execution phases to support the <code>Extended</code> mode of <code>PostgreSQL</code> protocol. To overcome that I started the development of a query analyzer. At some point, I realized that there is no much difference in <code>sqlparaser::ast</code> and <code>plan</code> structure that are passed and transformed from one into another. Developing that idea I realized that there are at least three different expression trees in the SQL query. The first one is each of the <code>values</code> in an <code>insert</code> statement. The second one is each assignment inside <code>update</code> queries and projection items in <code>select</code> queries. The difference between them very small to notice, <code>insert</code>’s values do not support column name in an expression but <code>update</code>’s assignments and <code>select</code>’s projection items do. The third one is the predicates in <code>select</code>’s <code>where</code>, <code>having</code> clauses and data definition’s <code>check</code> constraints. In the third variant, a predicate tree to be valid has to have the resulting <code>bool</code> type after an evaluation. These details seem insignificant but by realizing them I could see how much simpler query validation could be. Each type of query could have a separate validation code with some generality e.g. <code>select</code>s, <code>delete</code>s and <code>update</code>s have <code>where</code> clause. It triggered a massive refactoring and redesign. After a month of work, I merged <a href="https://github.com/alex-dukhno/database/pull/438">the first PR</a> that contains 8k lines of changes a week ago and <a href="https://github.com/alex-dukhno/database/pull/454">the second one</a> is coming.</p>

<p>To summaries my post somehow, I would like to wish everyone to find a domain where you want to build software in so much that if one day you realize that you have take a completely different approach (like throwing away everything and start over) you could no matter what accept it and continue your journey full of discovery and fun.</p>

<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>We live in an age of unprecedented surveillance, enhanced by modern technology,&nbsp;prompting some to suggest that privacy is dead.&nbsp;Previous scholarship suggests that no subset of the population feels this phenomenon more than marginalized communities. Those who rely on public benefits, for example, must turn over personal information and submit to government surveillance far more routinely than wealthier citizens who enjoy greater opportunity to protect their privacy and the ready funds to secure it. This article illuminates the other end of the spectrum, arguing that many individuals who may value government and nonprofit services and legal&nbsp;protections&nbsp;fail to enjoy these benefits because they reside in a “surveillance gap.” These people include&nbsp;undocumented immigrants, day laborers, homeless persons, and people with felony conviction histories&nbsp;suffering collateral consequences of their&nbsp;convictions.&nbsp;Members of these groups often remain outside of the mainstream data flows and institutional attachments necessary to flourish in American society.&nbsp;The harms that surveillance gap residents experience can be severe, such as&nbsp;physical and mental health injuries and lack of economic stability, as well as&nbsp;data marginalization&nbsp;and resulting invisibility to policymakers. In short, having too much privacy can be as injurious as having too little.</p>
<p>The sources of the&nbsp;surveillance gap range from&nbsp;attempts to contain and control marginalized groups to data silos to economic exploitation.&nbsp;This article explores the boundaries of the surveillance gap, evaluates how this emerging concept fits within existing privacy paradigms and theoretical frameworks, and suggests possible solutions to enhance the autonomy and dignity of marginalized people within the surveillance gap.</p>

                                                    <div>
                                                        <p>Although we live in a highly surveilled society, some people among us are functionally invisible. For example, low-wage workers—many of whom are undocumented immigrants—toil out of sight in an underground economy. A lack of a conventional paper trail or pay stub system linking workers to employers exposes these workers to potential wage theft and dangerous working conditions.<span title="2: See Stephen Lee, Policing Wage Theft in the Day Labor Market, 4 U.C. Irvine L. Rev. 655, 659–60 (2014) (“A coarse definition of day labor is temporary work in which the work, and often the workers, lack documentation.”)." data-indicator="1" data-footnum="2">1</span> While these workers are perilously out of reach of government and nonprofit organizations that could otherwise provide assistance,<span title="3: Infra Part II.B." data-indicator="2" data-footnum="3">2</span><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>they are also subject to heightened forms of surveillance, typically under the increasingly watchful eye of agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Likewise, homeless persons’ lives are defined by extremes: although they tend to live their lives in public, they are simultaneously governed by laws that criminalize their behavior, steadily pushing them out of view. Tellingly, when former Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe sought to restore the ability to vote to constituents who had committed felony crimes, his office was unable to find thousands of people—people who at one point spent time in the prison and parole systems where their whereabouts were always known to authorities.<span title="4: See Howell v. McAuliffe, 788 S.E. 2d 706, 710 (2016) (“McAuliffe’s Executive Order stated that it removed the political disabilities of approximately 206,000 Virginians who had been convicted of a felony but who had completed their sentences of incarceration and any periods of supervised release, including probation and parole.”); ACLU of Va., ACLU of Virginia Challenges Governor McDonnell to Restore Voting Rights to Greatest Number Possible (June 25, 2013), https://acluva.org/en/press-releases/aclu-virginia-challenges-governor-mcdonnell-restore-voting-rights-greatest-number [https://perma.cc/J9AK-L4E5] (noting that over 350,000 disenfranchised Virginians awaited restoration of their rights)." data-indicator="3" data-footnum="4">3</span> These examples illustrate that marginalized people experience privacy differently than most Americans. Specifically, they experience privacy extremes—being seen or tracked too much or too little.</p>
<p>Existing privacy scholarship has largely focused on the harms derived from too little privacy, and, in this vein, several scholars have highlighted the particularly intense surveillance of low-income people.<span title="5: See, e.g., Michele Estrin Gilman, The Class Differential in Privacy Law, 77 Brook. L. Rev. 1389, 1392–95 (2012) [hereinafter Class Differential]; Wendy A. Bach, The Hyperregulatory State: Women, Race, Poverty, and Support, 25 Yale J.L. &amp; Fem. 317, 331–32 (2014); Kaaryn Gustafson, Degradation Ceremonies and the Criminalization of Low-Income Women, U.C. Irvine L. Rev. 297, 312–21 (2013); see generally Virginia Eubanks, Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor (2017) (describing how digital data collection and algorithmic decision-making processes target and harm the poor); Khiara M. Bridges, The Poverty of Privacy Rights (2017) (describing how poor mothers in the United States lack a right to privacy); John Gilliom, Overseers of the Poor: Surveillance, Resistance and the Limits of Privacy (2001) (describing the hyper-surveillance and lack of privacy rights of a population of women on public assistance in rural Appalachia)." data-indicator="4" data-footnum="5">4</span> This article examines the other end of the spectrum—the surveillance gap. Life in the surveillance gap can be isolating, stigmatizing, dangerous, and harmful to a person’s physical and mental health. For one, legal protections available to other members of society remain out of reach to those in the surveillance gap. People also lose out on potential sources of economic and social support, because those who seek to provide services to disadvantaged members of our society often find it nearly impossible to reach them. Moreover, those who fall within the surveillance gap are not included within big data streams&nbsp;that ultimately shape public policy, thus leaving out their experiences and needs from the calculus that goes into creating policy.<span title="6: Daniel Castro, Ctr. on Data Innovation, The Rise of Data Poverty in America (Sept. 10, 2014), http://www2.datainnovation.org/2014-data-poverty.pdf [https://perma.cc/J7Y7-FB7Q]." data-indicator="5" data-footnum="6">5</span> Frustratingly, the challenges facing these groups remain invisible, further entrenching these groups’ marginalization.</p>
<p>The surveillance gap has multiple causes, ranging from data silos to poor data sharing, and from benign neglect to administrative systems that purposefully exclude certain people. This article seeks to identify and understand the causes, contours, and consequences of the surveillance gap and to outline legal and policy tools for addressing it. Part II provides case studies of populations living in the surveillance gap, including undocumented immigrants, day laborers, homeless persons, and people with felony conviction histories. Part III situates the surveillance gap within several scholarly streams. First, it assesses the surveillance gap through the lens of scholarship that differentiates between privacy harms experienced by varying groups. Second, it builds on insights from feminist legal theory involving the public/private binary and the harms associated with having too much privacy, wrestling with the tensions identified by feminists between liberalism’s ideals and individuals’ lived realities. Third, it examines notions of “choice” and “consent” in consumer and criminal privacy law, testing whether such frameworks are meaningful with regard to marginalized groups. Fourth, it adds a new dimension to emerging concepts of privacy as contextual. Fifth, it reviews fundamental rights theory’s impact on the surveillance gap, positing that the gap cannot be found in legal regimes that view privacy as a fundamental human right, such as in the European Union. Part IV suggests ways to address harms that arise in the surveillance gap while also respecting desirable forms of privacy and the dignity and autonomy of marginalized persons.<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>

Rev. 7, 18 (2013) (discussing source of the quote); see also Mary Kay Mallonee &amp; Eugene Scott, Comey: ‘There Is No Such Thing as Absolute Privacy in America’, CNN (Mar. 9, 2017), http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/james-comey-privacy-cybersecurity/index.html [https://perma.cc/F6XG-9ULF]; Marshall Kirkpatrick, Face‌book’s Zuckerberg Says the Age of Privacy Is Over, ReadWriteWeb (Jan. 9, 2010, 9:25 PM), https://readwrite.com/2010/01/09/facebooks_zuckerberg_says_the_age_of_privacy_is_ov/ [https:‌//perma.cc/T5S7-NKDK]." data-indicator="7" data-footnum="8">7</span> The so-called death of privacy stems from two main sources. First are the increasingly sophisticated tools that the government uses to monitor and track the populace. Fear of the government’s abuse of these tools has prompted some federal and state laws to protect Americans’ privacy,<span title="9: See, e.g., the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Pub. L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 (1986)&nbsp;(codified as amended at&nbsp;18 U.S.C. §§ 2510–22,&nbsp;27‌01–12, 3121–26 (2012)), and their state equivalents." data-indicator="8" data-footnum="9">8</span> although government surveillance at all levels is ever expanding and broader than most people realize.<span title="10: See generally Jennifer Stisa Granick, American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What to Do About It 9–26 (2017)." data-indicator="9" data-footnum="10">9</span> The second source derives from the private sector. To say that companies have come to appreciate the value of consumer data is a gross understatement. Companies now regularly collect, aggregate, buy, and sell consumer data on virtually every aspect of people’s lives, including buying preferences, health status, criminal and voting histories, and physical whereabouts.<span title="11: See generally Daniel J. Solove, The Digital Person: Technology and Privacy in the Information Age (2004)." data-indicator="10" data-footnum="11">10</span> For the modern citizen, this level of surveillance can be a form of control; it can be benign, helpful, or harmful, often depending on the perspective of the surveilled.<span title="12: For instance, consider Americans’ split reactions to Edward Snowden’s leaks about National Security Agency surveillance of Americans’ phone records. See Orin Kerr, Edward Snowden’s Impact, Wash. Post (Apr. 9, 2015), https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/09/edward-snowdens-impact [https://perma.cc/3EJQ-V45X]." data-indicator="11" data-footnum="12">11</span> Increasingly, large-scale data sharing between different levels of government and private industry blurs public/private distinctions. For instance, marketers build profiles of Americans using data from public databases and individual online browsing histories, while government agencies such as law enforcement purchase predictive analytic systems from private companies, which build their algorithms using combined public and private sources of data.<span title="13: Mary Madden, Michele Gilman, Karen Levy &amp; Alice Marwick, Privacy, Poverty, and Big Data: A Matrix of Vulnerabilities for Poor Americans, 95 Wash. U. L. Rev. 53, 63, 104–07 (2017)." data-indicator="12" data-footnum="13">12</span></p>
<p>Together, government and private-sector surveillance have created the sense that Americans are universally tracked and that few—except those living purposely “off the grid”—are able to evade government or private-sector surveillance.</p>
<p>While this lack of privacy has raised increasingly vocal concerns, the contemporary phenomenon of non-surveillance—that is, systemic invisibility of large portions of certain classes of people living in the United States—has received less attention. We call this the “surveillance gap,” although we acknowledge that the term is imperfect. While the concept of surveillance is commonly associated with government control of its citizenry, some of the harms that we identify occur in the private sphere. Indeed, we adopt a broader …</p></div></section></div></div></div></article></section></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8752676873929759179">
<p>A reader recently complained to me about the hyperlinks on this blog. The reader thought the links were too hard to distinguish from the rest of the text. And the reader’s right. The Swedish Greys desktop theme that I thought looked cool eight years ago, while attractive in an aesthetic sense (to me at least), is not the most usable or accessible. I’ll be looking for another theme.</p>

<p>I was able to style my blog however I wanted to and it looks the same in all browsers. That’s the flexibility of good HTML/CSS standards. Every site can look and behave exactly as the creator envisioned. It’s also why the Web’s a usability nightmare. We have to learn to use every site we visit because every site is designed differently. How come when we talk about Web standards the focus is almost entirely on technical standards? Where is the worry about design standards?</p>

<p>I recently finished reading the classic book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2JZgkSD">The Design of Everyday Things</a></em> by Don Norman and it talks about standards. Normans says “When all else fails, standardize.” Basically when you have no other way of implementing good design, you turn to standardization so at least every user only needs to learn how to use the similar things (in this case web pages) once. And I think we have no other way, because if we did, we would have figured it out in the past 30 years.</p>

<p>It wasn’t always this way. I remember using the pre-CSS and pre-JavaScript Web as a little kid on Mosaic. You knew there that the blue underlined text was always a hyperlink. And you knew that the back button always took you back a page. And you didn’t have to worry what different actions buttons did, because there was no JavaScript. I’m not saying we should go back there, but in many ways having the constraints made pages easier to use. There was no need to think. Now we have no constraints, but that’s why we need standards.</p>

<p>Every other major consumer computing platform but the Web has design standards. Apple’s platforms are famous for their Human Interface Guidelines. They are an attempt to ensure all apps follow some standard design conventions. Not every app does, but Apple has some ability to enforce them through its app stores, and some users even demand developers follow them. So, they are at least kinda sorta followed by most major apps. If the Web had design standards, maybe users would demand developers follow them too. Google and Microsoft have design suggestions and guidelines for their developers. This is why a good app for each platform feels “at home.”</p>

<p>But we have no design guidelines for the Web that are widely accepted. Sure, people have tried. But the only way we’re going to get something that’s actually followed is if we have a standard. And a standard needs to come from a standards body (Apple, Microsoft, and Google are the standards bodies for their respective platforms). W3C, please put some focus on a design standard. Not everybody will be forced to follow it, but it could do a lot of good in terms of usability.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <main>
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I’ve been writing code in vim for the past several years, and in this post I’d like to share some tips on configuring a development environment. This post contains some notes on configuration that would have helped me when I first started using vim and working on my own config. I hope that as a result of reading this, you will be able to improve your workflow with some new features and make the development process easier and more convenient.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at common tasks that occur when editing code and try to automate and improve them using vim. Each section contains a brief description of the problem, a proposed solution, overview of alternatives, a full code listing for the configuration, and a screenshot or animated screencast with a demonstration. At the end, additional links to useful plugins and resources will be provided.</p>
<p>Most of the tasks come down to installing and properly configuring one or more plugins. I assume that you are an experienced vim user and already use one of the plugin managers.</p>
<p>All of these tips are applicable in both vim and neovim. Also, despite the title, some of these tips can be applied not only to C++, but also to any other language.</p>
<h2 id="removing-trailing-whitespaces">Removing trailing whitespaces</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a very simple problem. Some code conventions restrict the leaving of trailing whitespaces. For example, the Linux Kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#spaces">prohibits</a> from doing this.</p>
<p>So we’d like to see when we accidentally leave a space at the end of a line. Let’s add the following lines in your vim configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>highlight</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>ctermbg</span>=<span>red</span> <span>guibg</span>=<span>red</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>BufWinEnter</span> * <span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>InsertEnter</span> * <span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+\%#\@&lt;!$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>InsertLeave</span> * <span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>BufWinLeave</span> * <span>call</span> <span>clearmatches</span>()<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>As a result, extra whitespaces will be highlighted as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/trailing-ws.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We also want to remove extra spaces by the single key binding. Let’s define it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Remove all trailing whitespaces</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>leader</span>&gt;<span>rs</span> :<span>let</span> <span>_s</span>=@<span>/ &lt;Bar&gt; :%s/</span>\<span>s</span>\+$<span>//</span><span>e</span> &lt;<span>Bar</span>&gt; :<span>let</span> @/=<span>_s</span> &lt;<span>Bar</span>&gt; :<span>nohl</span> &lt;<span>Bar</span>&gt; :<span>unlet</span> <span>_s</span> &lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>So we can solve this simple problem.</p>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/82yv3p/anyone_know_how_to_get_the_dots_for_leading/dveznas?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">can show</a> all whitespaces and line breaks in the source code.</li>
<li>There is <a href="https://editorconfig.org/">editorconfig</a> <a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim">plugin</a> for vim that supports the <code>trim_trailing_whitespace</code> option. When it is set to <code>true</code> the plugin will remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters.</li>
<li>See <a href="##formatting-source-code-with-clang-format">clang-format</a> section below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accessing-standard-library-documentation-using-cppman">Accessing Standard Library documentation using <code>cppman</code></h2>
<p>Vim ships with a man page viewer that works out of the box on any modern *nix via <a href="https://vimhelp.org/filetype.txt.html#ft-man-plugin">:Man</a> command. But the system man pages do not contain the definitions for C++. Let’s fix it by installing <a href="https://github.com/aitjcize/cppman">Cppman</a>.</p>
<p>Cppman is a set of C++ 98/11/14/17/20 manual pages for Linux, with source from <a href="https://cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a> and <a href="https://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</a>. You can easily install using <code>pip</code> or the package manager for your distribution according to their <a href="https://github.com/aitjcize/cppman#installation">Installation guide</a>. Next, let’s configure vim.</p>
<p>By default, when you press <code>K</code>, vim grabs the keyword under the cursor, separated by <a href="https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27iskeyword%27">iskeyword</a> symbols. There is one problem. The <code>:</code> symbol often found in C++ definitions is not included in the <code>iskeyword</code> array. So, for example, when you press <code>K</code> under the keyword <code>std::string</code>, vim will try to find the man page for <code>std</code>, instead of the full identifier. Let’s fix it with this small function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>function</span>! <span>s</span>:<span>JbzCppMan</span>()<span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> <span>old_isk</span> = &amp;<span>iskeyword</span><span>
</span><span></span>    <span>setl</span> <span>iskeyword</span>+=:<span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> <span>str</span> = <span>expand</span>(<span>"&lt;cword&gt;"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> &amp;<span>l</span>:<span>iskeyword</span> = <span>old_isk</span><span>
</span><span></span>    <span>execute</span> <span>'Man '</span> . <span>str</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>endfunction</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>command</span>! <span>JbzCppMan</span> :<span>call</span> <span>s</span>:<span>JbzCppMan</span>()<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We also need to remap the default <code>K</code> key binding to use our function in C++:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>au</span> <span>FileType</span> <span>cpp</span> <span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>buffer</span>&gt;<span>K</span> :<span>JbzCppMan</span>&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Here is a result:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/cppman.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="browsing-online-documentation-from-vim">Browsing online documentation from vim</h2>
<p>But what if you also want to quickly access online documentation for your favorite library or framework? Or may be search for unknown keywords on StackOverflow, Google or similar sites? And it is desirable to make a solution that can be easily extended to support more search engines.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tyru/open-browser.vim">open-browser.vim</a> can help us. This is a plugin that allows you open URLs in your favorite browser using vim.</p>
<p>Install it using your package manager. Then let’s add a simple configuration to access cppreference and Qt documentation pages:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>let</span> <span>g</span>:<span>openbrowser_search_engines</span> = <span>extend</span>(<span>
</span><span></span>\ <span>get</span>(<span>g</span>:, <span>'openbrowser_search_engines'</span>, {}),<span>
</span><span></span>\ {<span>
</span><span></span>\   <span>'cppreference'</span>: <span>'https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search={query}'</span>,<span>
</span><span></span>\   <span>'qt'</span>: <span>'https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/search-results.html?q={query}'</span>,<span>
</span><span></span>\ },<span>
</span><span></span>\ <span>'keep'</span><span>
</span><span></span>\)<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>And add some convenient key bindings by this way:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>leader</span>&gt;<span>osx</span> :<span>call</span> <span>openbrowser</span>#<span>smart_search</span>(<span>expand</span>(<span>'&lt;cword&gt;'</span>), <span>"cppreference"</span>)&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>leader</span>&gt;<span>osq</span> :<span>call</span> <span>openbrowser</span>#<span>smart_search</span>(<span>expand</span>(<span>'&lt;cword&gt;'</span>), <span>"qt"</span>)&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>As a result we can quickly browse online documentation for the word under the cursor:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/openbrowser.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Further use of this plugin is limited only by your imagination. For example, you can use it to search for similar C++ snippets in open source projects on GitHub:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>'github-cpp'</span>: <span>'http://github.com/search?l=C%2B%2B&amp;q=fork%3Afalse+language%3AC%2B%2B+{query}&amp;type=Code'</span>,<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Or integrate it with <a href="https://grep.app/">grep.app</a> or <a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">Debian Code Search</a>. Or add integration with your favorite online translation service, if you work with multiple languages. You get the idea. The main thing is to write the configuration correctly.</p>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KabbAmine/zeavim.vim">zeavim.vim</a> is a plugin that implements the integration with <a href="https://zealdocs.org/">Zeal</a> – free and open source offline documentation browser. In fact, it solves the same problem. You may want to use it if you don’t have an internet connection, or you need access to documentation for a specific version of the framework that isn’t available online.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhysd/devdocs.vim">devdocs.vim</a> is a plugin for <a href="https://devdocs.io/">devdocs</a> which also provides multiple API documentations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="switching-between-source-and-header-file">Switching between source and header file</h2>
<p>Switching between source and header files is another common operation when working with C++.</p>
<p>After searching and trying many solutions, I settled on <a href="https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-fswitch">vim-fswitch</a> plugin. Personally, I like this plugin for its simple configuration for various file types and the absence of third-party dependencies.</p>
<p>Install it with your favorite package manager. It will perfectly works out of the box, but sometimes you want to configure switch destination files like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>au</span> <span>BufEnter</span> *.<span>h</span>  <span>let</span> <span>b</span>:<span>fswitchdst</span> = <span>"c,cpp,cc,m"</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>BufEnter</span> *.<span>cc</span> <span>let</span> <span>b</span>:<span>fswitchdst</span> = <span>"h,hpp"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>It also will be convenient to set up some key bindings:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>A</span>-<span>o</span>&gt; :<span>FSHere</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>" Extra hotkeys to open header/source in the split</span><span>

<p><code>ctags</code> is a convenient indexing tool that allows you to go to symbol definition from your project using <code>tags</code> database. This is an old and reliable tool, that is <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/FAQ/CodeBrowsing">recommended</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33682137/8541499">to use</a> for large code bases like Linux Kernel where other tools like LSP may get stuck.</p>
<p>The most actual and maintained implementation of ctags is <a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">universal-ctags</a>. It is available in all popular distributions.</p>
<p>Vim has integrated ctags support. But here is one annoying thing. We need to generate <code>tags</code> database for each project using something like <code>ctags -R .</code>. Moreover, we need re-generate <code>tags</code> when editing the project.</p>
<p>This of course can be automated. Install <a href="https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags">vim-guttentags</a> is a plugin that will asynchronously (re)generate tag files as you work. I also suggest adding a simple configuration to avoid indexing of some unwanted files:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>set</span> <span>tags</span>=./<span>tags</span>;<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span> <span>g</span>:<span>gutentags_ctags_exclude_wildignore</span> = <span>1</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span> <span>g</span>:<span>gutentags_ctags_exclude</span> = [<span>
</span><span></span>  \<span>'node_modules'</span>, <span>'_build'</span>, <span>'build'</span>, <span>'CMakeFiles'</span>, <span>'.mypy_cache'</span>, <span>'venv'</span>,<span>
</span><span></span>  \<span>'*.md'</span>, <span>'*.tex'</span>, <span>'*.css'</span>, <span>'*.html'</span>, <span>'*.json'</span>, <span>'*.xml'</span>, <span>'*.xmls'</span>, <span>'*.ui'</span>]<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This makes your workflow simpler and more convenient. See also <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Browsing_programs_with_tags">this</a> detailed vimwiki article if you need more information about using ctags.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-source-file-structure-with-vistavim">Exploring source file structure with <code>vista.vim</code></h2>
<p>When you are working with unfamiliar source code, it may be convenient to browse the structure of the current source file. What classes, functions, macroses are defined here?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">vista.vim</a> is a plugin that helps us. It opens a split with the current file definitions. Here is what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/vista.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This plugin shows both LSP and ctags symbols. The LSP configuration is beyond the scope of this post, but it is a very useful feature that can give more accurate information.</p>
<p>To use it, install <a href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">vista.vim</a> with your favorite package manager and add a convenient key binding to toggle Vista split:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>A</span><span>-6</span>&gt; :<span>Vista</span>!!&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/tagbar">tagbar</a> is another plugin that provides a way to get the overview of the file structure. Unlike vista.vim, it doesn’t support LSP symbols and doesn’t provide useful utility functions for retrieving the information about the symbol under the cursor. But it’s simpler and more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="display-the-current-function-in-the-status-line">Display the current function in the status line</h2>
<p>Another feature of <a href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">vista.vim</a> is that it shares information of the symbol under the cursor. Using this we can display the current function name in the status line. This helps us navigate when moving through a large file.</p>
<p>Bellow is an example of configuration for the <a href="https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim">lightline</a>, but you can easily adapt it to your status bar:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>function</span>! <span>LightlineCurrentFunctionVista</span>() <span>abort</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>let</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> = <span>get</span>(<span>b</span>:, <span>'vista_nearest_method_or_function'</span>, <span>''</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>  <span>if</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> != <span>''</span><span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> = <span>'['</span> . <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> . <span>']'</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>endif</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>endfunction</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>VimEnter</span> * <span>call</span> <span>vista</span>#<span>RunForNearestMethodOrFunction</span>()<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/current-function.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Is you need the complete lightline configuration, see <a href="https://github.com/jubnzv/dotfiles/blob/dd46c2d940c13a0db8d94b02934659018358579a/.config/nvim/init.vim#L435-L462">this snippet</a> and take a look at lightline documentation.</p>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many alternatives provided by popular LSP plugins. For example, <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim">lsp-status.nvim</a> can provide the same information for Neovim’s built-in LSP server.</li>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When retrieving logs from an application, you are often looking for outliers
(such as a unique error) or what pattern occurs the most. However, defining
patterns manually is time-consuming and requires rigour across projects. In
this series of blog posts, we are going to explore automated Log Pattern
Recognition.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I recently began using <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/patterns/">Datadog Log Pattern</a>
and became addicted to it. Unfortunately, I was not able to find such a feature on
Kibana or a query proxy able to do this analysis. If that does not exist, I
might as well learn more about it and make one!</p>

<p>To my surprise, I did not find as many papers as I thought I would. And the
number of papers with public implementations is even lower. Our series begins
with a paper called <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/Papers/LogMine.pdf">LogMine: Fast Pattern Recognition for Log Analytics</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/trungdq88/logmine">an implementation made by Tony Dinh</a>
that helped me a lot to study LogMine’s behavior.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I searched for anything related to LogMine on Hacker News
and only found Tony Dinh’s submission.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-terms-used-in-this-article">Defining the terms used in this article</h2>

<p>Some terms used in this article can have several meanings. In Logmine’s context,
the terms I use mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>log</code>: a log line (<code>string</code>)
    <div><div><pre><code>12:00:00 - My awesome log
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><code>pattern</code>: Expression extracted by the algorithm (array of <code>field</code>)
    <div><div><pre><code>[&lt;date&gt;, "-", "My", "awesome", "log"]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><code>field</code>: Part of a <code>pattern</code> / Word from a <code>log</code> (Either a fixed value, a wildcard or a <code>variable</code>)</li>
  <li><code>cluster</code>: represents a group of logs that were identified as close to each
others</li>
  <li><code>variable</code>: a user-provided regex used to identify a known format
    <div><div><pre><code>number = \d+
time = \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-logmine">An introduction to LogMine</h2>

<p>The LogMine paper describes a method to parse logs, group them into clusters and
extract patterns without any prior knowledge or supervision. LogMine can be
implemented using MapReduce and works in a single pass over the dataset.</p>

<p>LogMine’s approach to grouping logs roughly works by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parsing logs into patterns</li>
  <li>Grouping patterns into clusters if the <a href="#clustering">distance</a> between them is small</li>
  <li>Merging clusters into a single pattern</li>
  <li>Repeat from step 2 until you are satisfied</li>
</ol>

<p>LogMine classifies fields into three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Fixed value</code>, a field that is constant across all logs in a cluster. This is
detected at the pattern extraction step.</li>
  <li><code>Variable</code>, a field that matches a pattern provided by the user. This is
detected at the pre-processing step.</li>
  <li><code>Wildcard</code>, a field that is not constant across all logs in a cluster. This is
detected at the pattern extraction step.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s illustrate how it works, step by step, using three simple logs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10:00:00 - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
10:30:00 - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
11:11:11 - [ERROR] - An error occurred while disconnecting user 456
12:12:12 - [DEBUG] - User 789 disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will also define a variable <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> that follows the pattern
<code>\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}</code>.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>A good practice would be to define more variables to avoid forming two clusters
from logs with low similarity. For instance, we <strong>should</strong> define <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>
as <code>\d+</code>.</p>

  <p>Depending on the pattern of your logs, defining a common field like <code>&lt;log-level&gt;</code>
as <code>[(DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR)]</code> might end up hiding information. This is
because a <code>WARNING</code> log with an error message might not be that important yet
the same log message with an <code>ERROR</code> level might have the exact information
you would like to highlight.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="log-parsing-and-dense-clusters-identification">Log parsing and dense clusters identification</h3>

<p>The first step is to parse logs into patterns and identify dense clusters. Dense
clusters are clusters where <strong>raw logs are almost identical</strong>.</p>

<p>To do this, we begin by splitting logs into patterns (an array of field). The
separator used by default is any whitespace character.</p>

<p>I stopped at the word <code>while</code> for readability reasons, but there’s no limit to
the number of fields.</p>

<h4 id="identifying-dense-clusters">Identifying dense clusters</h4>

<p>Once this transformation is done, we will reduce these patterns into dense
clusters. Identifying dense clusters can be seen as a special use-case of the
clustering algorithm: we identify clusters but <strong>we skip the pattern extraction
step as these patterns are nearly identical</strong>.</p>

<p>As such, I’ll first introduce the clustering algorithm and the notion of
distance between patterns.</p>

<h3 id="grouping-patterns-into-clusters">Grouping patterns into clusters</h3>

<p>The clustering algorithm takes a list of patterns and identifies patterns that
are close to each other. Both the Tony Dinh’s implementation and the paper uses
the distance defined as:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Dist</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mtext>Min</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></munderover><mfrac><mrow><mtext>Score</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mtext>Max</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Dist}(P,Q) = 1 -

<p>If the distance between the two patterns is inferior to a threshold <code>MaxDist</code>
defined internally, then the two patterns are considered a member of the same
cluster.</p>

<div>
  <p>This comparison process can be optimized by skipping unnecessary work if the
sum is already greater than our <code>MaxDist</code>.</p>

  <p>This is valid because the elements inside the sum can’t be negative.</p>
</div>

<p>The scoring function proposed in the paper allows for tweaking weights depending
on the field type.</p>

  0 &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p>In order to keep performance, the scoring function can’t return a negative
value. Therefore <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code> can’t be negative.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>The definition of this scoring function seems to have left some place for interpretation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tony Dinh’s implementation <a href="https://github.com/trungdq88/logmine/blob/a7595c6a0b313b43969199c18465cc8bec3b57d1/src/line_scorer.py#L29">checks for equality</a>
if both value are fixed values.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/logpai/logparser/blob/master/logparser/LogMine/LogMine.py">LogPai’s LogParser</a> dropped the concept of variables and uses k2 to tune wildcards weight</li>
  </ul>

</div>

<p>Let’s define <code>k1=1</code> and <code>k2=1</code>, these are the weight used by Tony Dinh’s
implementation and recommended by the original paper.</p>

<h4 id="applying-the-clustering-algorithm">Applying the clustering algorithm</h4>

<p>For this example, I will use the original paper recommendation (<code>MaxDist=0.01</code>).
The MaxDist parameter is used to tune the algorithm sensitivity: the higher
<code>MaxDist</code>, the more patterns are detected.
If <code>MaxDist</code> is too high, patterns are grouped into very large clusters and
pattern extraction become meaningless.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>As we are using <code>MaxDist=0.01</code>, and since the logs in my example are very short,
we will only identify logs that are identical. For this reason, <strong>we can use the
clustering algorithm to identify dense clusters</strong> by skipping the pattern
recognition step.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="pattern-detection">Pattern detection</h3>

<p>In sequential (as opposed to MapReduce) mode, each time a pattern is inserted
in a cluster, LogMine will try to extract patterns from them. LogMine knows
only how to identify two types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed values</li>
  <li>Wildcards</li>
</ul>

<p>While it seems rather strict, remember that the early pattern detection during
tokenization already took care of identifying user-defined patterns.</p>

<div>
  <p>Generating the pattern each time a new pattern is added allows LogMine to only
keep one representative for each cluster. This is a very important factor to
reduce memory usage.</p>

  <p><strong>MapReduce behavior is described later in this article.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>As patterns in the same cluster can have a different number of fields, the paper
uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm">Smith-Waterman</a>
algorithm to align them. The Smith-Waterman is mainly used in Bioinformatics to
align sequences. It is interesting to see an algorithm like this applied to
log pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Once the two patterns are aligned, we compare one by one the field:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the value is equal, we assign a fixed value</li>
  <li>If the value is different, we assign a wildcard pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>The Smith-Waterman algorithm adds placeholders to align logs. These placeholders
are <strong>never equal</strong> to a field value. This means that aligned parts of a log are
always identified as wildcards.</p>

<p>The output of the pattern detection algorithm is a <strong>new list of patterns</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s assume that the previous algorithm identified a cluster with two patterns:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 789 disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="result-of-applying-the-smith-waterman-algorithm">Result of applying the Smith-Waterman algorithm</h4>

<p>Because examples in this article would have gotten very complex, I decided to
not use non-aligned logs in my examples. However, you might be curious as to how
the Smith-Waterman works.</p>

<p>On the implementation, LogMine would have aligned the two following patterns by
adding a <code>None</code> value in a field. For instance:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 has disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>would become:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 &lt;None&gt; disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 has disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
  <p><strong>The Smith-Waterman does not understand patterns</strong>. The Smith-Waterman uses
the same scoring function as the clustering algorithm. As such, if two fields
are not equal, there is no guarantee that the placeholder will be inserted
properly.</p>

  <p>If we tweak our previous example to:</p>
  <div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 456 has disconnected
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>The Smith-Waterman algorithm would transform it to:</p>
  <div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User &lt;None&gt; 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 456 has disconnected
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>The alignment was added <strong>before</strong> the user identifier.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="repeat-until-satisfied">Repeat until satisfied</h3>

<p>As the pattern extraction algorithm returns a list of patterns, we can relax
<code>MaxDist</code> and feed this list back into the clustering algorithm.</p>

hierarchy of possible patterns from very strict to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

It’s something you always come back to, even as Pandas, Julia, Spark, Hadoop, and NoSql attempt to dethrone and replace SQL as the new de-facto data tool.</p><p>Eventually though, they all fail in the face of the consistently reliable SQL. And that's why SQL continues to get asked in interviews. </p><blockquote><strong>A note before we start...</strong></blockquote><blockquote>This guide should be used for anyone who is preparing for an interview in which they know SQL will show up. This guide<strong> is not</strong> a search engine optimized listacle (top 50 sql questions for 2021...really?).</blockquote><blockquote>Rather, this is <strong>real advice and REAL interview questions and exercises </strong>gathered from hundreds of data scientists, engineers, and analysts. We sprinkle exercises throughout this post after learning concepts. Be sure to try attempting the questions first before we walk through solving them. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Lastly, if you enjoy this article, <strong>please give us a share</strong> and check out our <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/courses/data-science-course">SQL course</a> that goes a little deeper with more exercises and problems. </blockquote><h2 id="1-why-does-sql-show-up-on-the-interview">1.

Even though Google Sheets allows users to easily manipulate and visualize data, it cannot store and scale like a SQL database can. Other popular programs –namely Hadoop and Spark– can scale much further than SQL, but still don’t have a clean and easy-to-use language like SQL to retrieve data efficiently.</p><p>Another great thing about SQL is that understanding the fundamentals bridges the gap between <strong>engineering and data science</strong>. Knowing SQL well gives you a competitive edge over any other candidate, whether you're competing for a position as a product manager, software engineer, or even as a business analyst. Having the skillset to write and pull your own queries is like being a magician that can come up with analyses out of thin air. </p><p>And at the end of the day, you could just be really good at SQL if you wanted to and make tons of money creating ETL jobs or pulling dashboards with efficiency. That's how valued SQL is. </p><h3 id="how-often-does-sql-show-up-in-interviews">How often does SQL show up in interviews?</h3><p>One prevailing question is how often SQL shows up in interviews. </p><p>At Interview Query, we analyzed a dataset of Glassdoor data science interview experiences and responses submitted by our users.

Strategies for the live SQL interview</h2><p>Let's go over the common strategies when tackling SQL interview questions. </p><p><strong>1.Repeat the problem statement</strong></p><p>When presented with a SQL question, listen carefully to the problem description and repeat back what you think the crux of the problem is. The interviewer can then help verify if your understanding is correct.</p><p><strong>2. Understand the edge cases</strong></p><p>If time permits, write out a base case and an edge case to show that you understand the problem. For example: if the interviewer asks you to pull the average number of events per user per day, write out an example scenario where you're verifying this metric. </p><p>Do duplicate events matter? Are we looking at distinct users? These are questions we need to clarify. </p><p><strong>3. Try working backwards if the problem is tricky</strong></p><p>Sketching out what the output of the SQL question will look like is a great strategy towards solving the problem. Usually, if I know what the end output table is supposed to look like, I can work backwards from there on what functions need to be applied before. </p><p>For example, if the output looks like this:</p><pre><code>date        | average events per user
------------+-----------------------
2021-12-01  |  3.5
2021-12-02  |  4.0</code></pre><p>I know that the table before this aggregation would have to look something like this.</p><pre><code>date       | event | user_id
-----------+-------+--------
2021-12-01 | click | 1
2021-12-01 | view  | 1
......</code></pre><p>And then, I can figure out what functions I should use to get to my desired output!</p><p><strong>4. Pattern match to different functions</strong></p><p>As you practice more and more SQL exercises, what you'll find is that many SQL problems follow similar patterns. There are techniques we can use in SQL, like utilizing <code>HAVING</code> on aggregations, self-joins and cross-joins, and applying window functions. But, additionally, we'll see problems that run in a similar vein. </p><p>For example, writing a query to get the second highest salary or writing a query to isolate every fifth purchase by a user utilizes the same <code>RANK</code> function in SQL. </p><p>Understanding the commonalities between questions will help you understand the first step to solving SQL questions faster because you can re-use similar code and stitch together techniques on top of each other. </p><p><strong>5. Start writing SQL</strong></p><p>Finally, it's important to just start writing SQL. It's better to start writing an imperfect solution vs trying to perfectly understand the problem or trying to perfect the solution on the first try. </p><p>Verbalize your assumptions and what you're doing as you write SQL and your interviewer can then be put on the same page as you. </p><h2 id="3-the-7-different-sql-interview-questions">3. The 7 different SQL interview questions</h2><p>SQL questions asked during interviews can vary widely across companies, but even more so across positions. You won't see data scientists asked the same SQL questions as software engineers, and that's because data scientists have to write different types of queries compared to software engineers. </p><p>Generally, each SQL interview question can be bucketed into these categories:</p><ul><li>Definition based SQL questions</li><li>Basic SQL questions</li><li>Reporting and metrics SQL questions</li><li>Analytics SQL questions</li><li>ETL SQL questions</li><li>Database design questions</li><li>Logic based SQL questions</li></ul><p>In this next section, we'll go over which types of SQL questions are expected for different roles and what those different kinds of SQL questions are in detail. </p><h2 id="4-sql-questions-for-data-scientists-and-analysts">4. SQL questions for data scientists and analysts</h2><p>SQL interview questions for data scientists and data analysts will likely show up in three parts of the interview process: the technical round, the take-home challenge, and the onsite interview. </p><p>The technical round and take-home challenge will usually consist of SQL questions <strong>designed to filter out candidates</strong>. Since SQL is commonly used as a filter mechanism for data scientists, it's important to perform well on this part of the interview in order to demonstrate competence. </p><p>Depending on what type of data science role you're interviewing for, you'll find that most SQL questions will be split into these three types:</p><ul><li>Basic SQL Interview Questions</li><li>Reporting and Metrics SQL Interview Questions</li><li>Analytics SQL Interview Questions</li></ul><h3 id="basic-sql-interview-questions">Basic SQL Interview Questions</h3><p>Basic SQL questions are what they sound like. These questions will be generally easy and focus on assessing if you know the basics. </p><p><strong>Definition based SQL questions </strong>are grouped into this category because they're super easy to learn. All you have to do is study a list of definitions of SQL terms and applications. These questions will include understanding the differences between joins, what kinds of aggregations exist, and knowing the basic functions like <code>CASE WHEN</code> or <code>HAVING</code>. </p><p>Basic SQL interview questions that involve a user actually writing a query are slightly different. These will involve getting the <code>COUNT</code> of a table, knowing what the <code>HAVING</code> clause does, and figuring out how to utilize <code>LEFT JOIN</code> versus <code>INNER JOIN</code> to give you the values that you need.</p><blockquote>Read more on the the <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-three-sql-questions-you-must-know-to-pass/">basic concepts you need to know to pass your data science interview</a> here. </blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-three-sql-questions-you-must-know-to-pass/"><div><p>Three SQL Concepts for your Data Scientist Interview</p><p>I’ve interviewed a lot of data scientist candidates and have found there are a a lot of SQL interview questions for data science that eventually boil down to three generalized types of conceptual understandings.</p><p><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/favicon.ico"><span>Interview Query Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2020/02/sql_join.jpeg"></p></a></figure><p><strong>Basic SQL Concepts to Review</strong></p><ul><li>What's the difference between a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> and an <code>INNER JOIN</code>?</li><li>When would you use <code>UNION</code> vs <code>UNION ALL</code>?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h3 id="TLDR"><a href="#TLDR" title="TLDR"></a>TLDR</h3><p>My first Android App made me $1300+ in its first month. I failed to maintain and grow it due to lack of focus.</p>
<h3 id="💵-Show-me-the-money"><a href="#💵-Show-me-the-money" title="💵 Show me the money"></a>💵 Show me the money</h3><p>My Adsense Account in Feb 2015.<br><img src="https://harishgarg.com/images/android-earnings-feb.png" alt="Android App Earnings - Feb 2015"></p>
<p>And this is what it looked like in Mar 2015.<br><img src="https://harishgarg.com/images/android-earnings-high.png" alt="Android App Earnings - Mar 2015"></p>
<p>All this from a single, simple app that displayed some Hindi to English phrases in a list format.</p>
<h3 id="🏗-The-process"><a href="#🏗-The-process" title="🏗 The process"></a>🏗 The process</h3><p>I got laid off from the place I worked for 11+ years (that’s another story which I will share in a future post) in Aug 2014. </p>
<p>My last position was as a manager overseeing a quality team where I began as an engineer 11 years back. I didn’t want to go back to the job of a manager at another company. So, if no job, then what? </p>
<p>I decided I am going to build web apps. I haven’t written any code for a few years. I had written PERL and Python but not for some years now. 37signals(now Basecamp) and DHH were all the rage then. So, I jumped into learning Ruby on Rails. I had never built a Full Stack App. I didn’t get much further. After a couple of months, I abandoned it. </p>
<p>Time to get on to the next shiny toy. Mobile Apps, especially on Android were still picking up. I decided to give it a shot. I narrowed down on the India Market. It was hard to get users in India to pay for apps. So, the obvious choice was to go with a Free App with in-app ads</p>
<p>I chose the learning category for my first app. I wanted to make sure I target the largest user-base. I narrowed it down to building a Learn English App for the Native Hindi Speakers. Hindi Speakers are the largest cohort by languages in India.</p>
<p>I had never programmed in Java or for Android before this. I spent a few weeks getting Android Studio to work on my Ubuntu laptop. At last, I cobbled together a simple list-based app. The first screen showed a list of phrase categories in both Hindi and English. For example Numbers, Greetings, and so on. Clicking on one of the categories takes you to the second screen with a list of phrases in that category. So, two screens and a JSON file with 100 odd words/phrases. I also added the logic of showing a small thin banner ad at the bottom of the page on the details screen.</p>
<p>I generated the build, created an Android Developer Account, and uploaded the App. This was the end of Feb. Nothing happened for a couple of Days. </p>
<h3 id="🌱-Green-shoots"><a href="#🌱-Green-shoots" title="🌱 Green shoots"></a>🌱 Green shoots</h3><p>Then a couple of days in Mar, I happened to log into the Developer Console and the No. of Installs was in 10,000s. I logged into Google Adsense. And it showed my estimated earnings to be a Few hundred dollars.</p>
<p>This was the first time I made money on the internet, outside a regular corporate job.</p>
<p>That Month, Adsense made me 1300 dollars. And throughout its lifetime, the app made me little over 2000 dollars and had MAUs at around 50K at its peak.</p>
<h3 id="☠-The-Mistakes"><a href="#☠-The-Mistakes" title="☠ The Mistakes"></a>☠ The Mistakes</h3><p>Yet, this is where I made my first big mistake. Instead of focusing on this one app, I started replicating it. For example, I made apps for Learn English from Kannada, Arabic, and so on. None of the other apps got any traction. I did some minor improvements to the main Hindi to English app. But the revenue &amp; usage tapered off in a couple of months.</p>
<p><img src="https://harishgarg.com/images/android-app-chart.png" alt="Android App Earnings"></p>
<p>If I get to re-do it, what would I do differently? I would double down on the first app. I would add more features for the Hindi users first. When the user growth got stabilized, only then I would have added more language pairs. Focus is what matters in the end.</p>

                <p>The coming defeat of the platform monoculture. </p>
        </header>

        <p><img src="https://troynikov.io/content/images/2020/11/BA81E56A-64CB-4D9D-90BB-045B54CAC790.jpeg" alt="Rewilding the Web"></p>

        <div>
            <p>The web is a much duller place now than it was 20 years ago. A large part of the reason is that the early web was much more fragmented, creating many ecological niches which became inhabited by the various strange and delightful species that tend to flourish in such environments. </p><p>For a moment there was the idea that the web was mainly for publishing whatever you wanted, to your own website, and people could come look at it and interact with it wherever or whoever they were. And people chose to create some amazing things. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Ghost Pages: A Wired.com Farewell to GeoCities" data-author="@wired" cite="https://www.wired.com/2009/11/geocities/">
The average person could create a web site for free, no questions asked. People took the opportunity and ran with it, building millions of pages –- 38 million at last count, according to Yahoo. They helped make the web a more vibrant territory, no longer the citadel of nerds in the know.

</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Nobody had yet found a way to index and catalogue everything, and so curation according to individual ideals and tastes was the norm. Webrings, blogrolls, portals, and other mechanisms let people actually find the things on the web that, to them as individuals, were worth finding. </p><p>But as more people got online and as using the web became more mainstream and less unusual, and eventually more about interaction than one-way publishing, the fragmentation gave way to a great wave of homogenization. The web is a massive distribution system with virtually zero marginal cost, and connecting everyone to everyone else in order to exploit the incredible power of <a href="https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/network-effects-dynamics-in-practice/">network effects</a>, is good business strategy. </p><p>People want to be where everyone else is. </p><p>Under that kind of selection pressure, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law outcomes</a> are inevitable, and that gave rise to what we have now; almost everyone is on only a very few platforms. In order to keep users, the platforms have to try to please the greatest number of people, leading to boring and minimally controversial design decisions which nevertheless draw ire because they please no one in particular. </p><p>If everything has to be for everyone because everyone is connected to everyone else, nothing can really be for someone in particular. It has to turn into grey goo. Total networking means total boredom. And one by one the forums, blogs, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">ecosystem</a> that sustained them and drove early web culture went dark, or were otherwise sidelined. </p><figure><img src="https://troynikov.io/content/images/2020/10/38ED9190-9C0D-41A6-BE7F-FCEEABC64F88.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://troynikov.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/38ED9190-9C0D-41A6-BE7F-FCEEABC64F88.jpeg 600w, https://troynikov.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/38ED9190-9C0D-41A6-BE7F-FCEEABC64F88.jpeg 1000w, https://troynikov.io/content/images/2020/10/38ED9190-9C0D-41A6-BE7F-FCEEABC64F88.jpeg 1020w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The homogenizing effect of total networking was predicted in 1975, in <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Nelson-ComputerLibDreamMachines1975.pdf">Dream Machines / Computer Lib&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure><p>Network effects have enormous lock-in. Once people are where everyone else is, they don't really want to leave. So is that it? Are we at <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/big-tech-at-the-end-of-history">the end of history for big tech</a>? Are we doomed to endless debate about, of all things, content moderation policies? Is the only possible change to come from regulators breaking up the platform "monopolies" ?</p><p>I don't think so. </p><hr><p>Dissatisfaction with the platforms is rising in many corners, whether as part of a broader reaction to media institutions which now use the platforms as a distribution channel, or else just out of exasperation with the sorts of interactions that have become characteristic. The people no longer want uniform ideas from the usual suspects. </p><p>The platforms are aware of this dissatisfaction and have tried to adapt. The algorithmic feed was born out of the necessity of de-homogenizing what people saw, in an attemp to surface only things both relevant and interesting to each individual. But because on any given platform everyone gets the same algorithm, we now have the second order phenomenon where everyone sees whatever material is best at gaming the current iteration of the algorithm, and "<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/the-linguistics-of-youtube-voice/418962/">youtuber voice</a>". &nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the dissatisfaction in the mainstream, there are those for whom the dominant medium of the platforms isn't the right kind of frontier. These people are driven as creators by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumos"><em>thymos</em></a>, a spirited sense of adventure and personal risk, who want to create something great and gain recognition and fame. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Thriverism" data-author="@sonyasupposedly" cite="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/thriverism/">
<p>The chance and challenge to express your will, to enact it on the world. The freedom and drive to forge a self that <em>matters</em> — to others, but also intrinsically. A self that self-justifies.</p>

</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>These are people who want to fight and win in the noosphere, to convince you of their ideas and aesthetics. From these people the weird, unusual, provocative, and novel flows. Around them schools of thought and marketplaces of ideas form. They're already anchors or up-and-comers on the platforms themselves. </p><p>These are twin forces pulling in the same direction; to bring into existence new modes of creation and distribution that operate at human scale, not at the scale of power laws. Just as we are witnessing <a href="https://pullrequest.substack.com/p/the-prophet-of-the-revolt">the revolt of the public</a> tear through legacy institutions, we are about to witness a grass-roots revolt against the platforms, for and by the people for whom homogenization isn't satisfying. </p><p>And they have the tools to do so. </p><hr><p>The tools and infrastructure that made the web interesting in the first place never actually went away. &nbsp;And since then, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">many</a> <a href="https://substack.com/">new</a> <a href="https://ghost.org/">tools</a> to do this have joined them. &nbsp;</p><p>For now the ecosystem being created by these tools just looks a lot like blogging but with paywalls, tailored to those who want to disintermediate the platforms by owning their own brand, and who want to bypass legacy media institutions by being paid directly by their fans. The communication is still largely one-way. But this misses the larger potential. </p><p>What these new tools offer is actually friction.</p><p>Whether monetary or reputational (as in the form of invite systems), these small tokens of commitment create just enough friction to get the kind of fragmentation that lets niches flourish instead of getting smoothed out at platform scale. It makes the edges of the network bumpy to traverse. And that gives ecological niches the room they need to grow or evolve without being globally sterilized. </p><p>Through these mechanisms the contributors / subscribers / fans, now connected directly to each creator, represent a directly addressable community bound by taste on the one hand and commitment on the other. Indeed we have seen <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">similar</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">communities</a> and their diaspora emerge with real-world identities from their on-line roots. The first signs of this are already in play, as more discussion moves to the private spaces of group chats, secret groups, and invite-only discussion communities. </p><p>With the right tools some of these communities will inevitably grow large, others will stay small deliberately. Some will often create and discuss openly in public, others only rarely. Each one free to set its own norms and identity, and to decide what success looks like. Some may federate and cross-pollinate, while others will represent deep and vertical identity. But they'll be interesting, they will create a sense of belonging and identity, and they'll be weird. </p><p>The platforms still have a role to play. Rather than being hosts and propagators of creativity directly, their function will shift to one of surfacing and discovery. On a vibrant, fragmented, culturally active web, there will be no shortage of things to try, communities to observe or join, people to be excited by. The communities are our families, private clubs, monasteries and brotherhoods, while the platforms will be the town square we congregate in. &nbsp;</p><p>This is a symbiotic relationship; the communities are what people will come to the platforms for, the platforms will have the wide distribution through which even the most esoteric community can find new members - necessary for keeping them alive and thriving. </p><hr><p>I don't believe it's possible to return to the early web, and it would be foolish to deny the human drives and desires that created the explosive growth and enormous scale of the platforms in the first place. But something new is on the horizon. </p><p>A new kind of symbiosis, between the vast scale of the platforms and the human interaction of the communities is now being built. The weird will inherit the web. &nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Title image courtesy of <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-fox-chernobyl-exclusion-zone.html">The Natural History Museum</a></em></p>

        <p>The premise of the movie "Idiocracy" is simple: in the future mankind has de-evolved into morons. Technology does so much for everybody that nobody knows how it all works anymore. &nbsp;If we can't fix it, we're all going to die.</p><p>One character asks the other what he likes, The answer is money.</p><p>"I can't believe you like money too!" the first character says without irony, "We should hang out!"</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/JRJcXbeoSOlkRRzbC7HJ_idiocracy.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The gag here is that of course, most everybody likes money. If you reduce all of your life enough, it's just food, sex, money, and looking cool. But who would want to do that? Over the centuries, humans have created massively-complex societies because everybody has different things they like doing and thinking about, but all of that complexity can be reduced to, well, an idiocracy if you try hard enough.</p><p>The movie, however, is just a joke, right? We would never allow that to happen, of course, because that's not the goal of technology. Technology's goal is to make us better, not dumber.</p><p>Wait one. Is that true? What <em>is</em> the goal of technology, anyway? Has anybody ever clearly stated it?</p><p>Recently I've heard two goals:</p><ol><li>The goal of technology is to become a <strong>brain extension</strong>, <em>helping you to decide what to do</em> and then helping you get it done.</li><li>The goal of technology is to become a <strong>hand-held power tool</strong>, helping you accomplish the things you've <em>already decided to do</em></li></ol><p>That's not the same thing. It turns out the difference is critical.</p><p>The old goal was much simpler: make something people want. I like that goal! It boils down the job of creating technology to the most important parts, need and ability. But was that sustainable? At the end of the day, don't we always end up making some combination of stuff that either helps us <em>make decisions</em> or helps us <em>implement decisions</em> we've already made? And aren't the two fundamentally incompatible in a future society?</p><p>Yelp tells you which restaurant to go to. Your GPS automatically takes you there. These are not just different problems, they're different <em>kinds of problems</em>. Getting from point A to point B is a matter of math and geometry. Which restaurant is the best tonight? You could spend hours debating that with friends.</p><p>If you reduce anything down enough it becomes idiotic. Each piece of technology we deploy can have the goal of helping us do what we've already decided or helping us decide what to do. The first option leaves the thinking up to us. The second option "helps" us think.</p><figure><iframe width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZHCVyllnck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>You like money too? Wow! I like money! We should hang out!</p><p>Human brains are not computers. Brains are designed to help us survive and pass on our genes using the minimum amount of energy available. If the GPS takes me where I'm going, I don't need to know how to use maps anymore. So I stop knowing how to use maps. Dump those neurons, they're not needed. If Yelp picks the restaurants for me enough, I stop having nuanced preferences about restaurants. That energy expenditure is no longer needed for survival and reproduction. Dump those neurons. Over time people stop caring about the tiny details of what the difference is between a good and a great restaurant. Yelp handles that.</p><p>For some folks, who cares? It's food. Go eat it. For other folks, picking the right place can be a serious undertaking, worthy of heavy thought and consideration. But if over the years apps like Yelp boil all of that down to four or five stars, then our collective brain is not going to bother with it. Human brains are not computers. If computers do the work for us, we turn off those neurons and save energy.</p><p>Meanwhile, on social media there's currently this huge discussion. One bunch of folks says that social media is being overbearing in its censorship of fringe and sometimes hateful opinions. The other bunch of folks says social media is a festering sore full of people who are ugly, hateful, and abusive to those weakest among us. The community has to set standards.</p><p>There doesn't have to be a right and wrong here. I think the crucial thing to to understand that both sides can be entirely correct. We are dealing with the same kind of question.</p><p>All three of these topics -- whether humanity is becoming idiots or not, what the ultimate goal of technology is or should be, and how social media should work -- are intricately related. They're related because of this: <em>the platform is the enemy</em>.</p><p>The minute we create a platform for something, whether it's rating movies, tracking projects, or chatting with friends about work, as that platform takes over mindshare, <em>the assumption becomes that this is a solved problem</em>.</p><p>The telephone was great. Once we had the telephone, people didn't have to worry about how to talk to people far away anymore. Just pick up the phone. Solved problem.</p><p>Facebook is great. Once we had Facebook, people didn't have to worry about how to interact with their friends in a social setting anymore. Just click on the little FB notification (Which seems to be always flashing for some reason to get my attention) Solved problem?</p><p>But these are entirely different things! With the phone, I know who I want to call and why. I push buttons and we are connected. The tech helps me do what I've already decided to do. With Facebook, on the other hand, they get paid to show me things in a certain order. The premise is that I'm waiting (or "exploring" if you prefer) until I find something to interact with. The phone is a tool for me to use. I am the tool Facebook is using. I am no longer acting. I am reacting.</p><p>And even if they weren't paid, interacting with friends socially is an extremely complex affair. What kind of mood are they in? What's their life history? What things are bad to bring up? How does their body language look? Facebook's gimmick is "Hey, we've reduced all of this to bits and bytes, and we'll even show you what bits and bytes to look at next!"</p><p>Solved problem.</p><p>Many, many people do not use the internet, the internet uses them. And this percentage is constantly growing.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/9EBNeUmSy6TMDUpKTLL6_terminator-robot.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Just like the restaurant example, maybe that's fine. I have friends, I have opinions, who cares? It's all idle chat anyway.</p><p>That logic can be true for a bunch of things, but can't be true for <em>everything</em>. Otherwise, at some point 100 years from now, we're comparing our life values and end up saying something like "I like money too". Everything can't all be reduced down to the lowest common denominator. If it does, we all die.</p><p>Life is not a bit or byte, a number to be optimized. It's meaning we define ourselves, in ways we should not quantize.</p><p>Platforms, by their very nature, constantly send out the subtle message: <em>This is a solved problem. No further effort on your part is required here. No thinking needed.</em> Platforms resist change. They resist their own evolution by subtly poisoning the discussion before it even starts.</p><p>Are restaurant choices more or less important than which movie to watch tonight? There's no right or wrong answer to these questions. We have nice categories like restaurants and movies because currently people consider those things to be different kinds of choices. But why? If the algorithm is king, why shouldn't an algorithm determine both of those things for me? And if it does, why should I bother with worrying about which category is which?</p><p>Human brains are not computers. Let the platform decide. Energy not needed. Dump those neurons.</p><p>This is the more important point. It's not that the platforms turn what might be complex things into simple numbers, or even that they monetize attention. It's that by turning everything into numbers, over time they destroy the distinction between the categories entirely. Platforms are the enemy because they resist analysis in the areas they dominate.</p><p>Platforms turn into settled fact things that should be open for debate, like whether or not Taco Bell is a Mexican restaurant, or whether Milo is an artist with something useful to tell us. (I'm going with "no" and "no" for both of these.) More dangerously, they do the work of deciding <em>what categories various things go into</em>. This category over here is important. That category over there is not. We all make these decisions, and they're all different, and the categories each of us pays careful attention to and loves obsessing about are all different, and because we all have different viewpoints and priorities humankind advances in thousands of directions simultaneously. We survive. We evolve.</p><p>Twitter has to decide whether PERSON_X can speak or not because on the Twitter platform, that question has to have a yes or no answer based on the person. Twitter's category for deciding who can speak is "who is that?" Is that the right category for social conversations? For political conversations? For conversations about philosophy? Math? Who knows? Who cares? Twitter has decided. Solved problem.</p><p>Everybody has different things they like doing and thinking about. Different conversations and audiences have different criteria. Some problems should never be solved. Or rather more directly, some problems should never have a universal answer.</p><p>An aside: We see the same thing in programming. One bunch of folks creates various platforms in order to do the thinking for another bunch of folks. Sometimes these platforms take off and become industry standards. That's quite rare, however. Most of the time we end up training morons who can weakly code against the platform but can't reason effectively about the underlying architecture or reason for the platform to exist in the first place. In our desire to help, we harm the very people we're trying to assist -- by subtly giving them the impression that this is a solved problem. Programmers are just a decade or so ahead of the rest of us.</p><p>Popular platforms aren't just a danger economically because they control commerce. They're not just a danger politically because they selectively control and amplify political discourse. They're an extinction-level, existential danger to humans because they prevent people from seriously considering what kinds of categories are important in …</p></div></div></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This year Google will stop supporting and remove Google Hangouts. Google Hangouts, if you're not aware, was Google's replacement for their chat program Google Talk. Google Talk was a XMPP-based chat client that was available for all users of Google services. Google Hangouts was rolled out around the same time as Google+, and was a wrapper for many different Google services (phone, video chats, and Hangouts on Air). What was nice about it was that anyone that you knew the GMail address of had access to Google Hangouts. This meant that many of my friends had Hangouts access. JoDee and I used Hangouts for much of our IM communication. Unfortunately for whatever reason Google decided to remove yet another of the things that I liked about Google services, and proves once again that Google can't be trusted with any social platform.</p>
<p>Today I downloaded the "Google Takeout" of Hangouts and removed all of the old chats. There were a lot of nice memories in there, and now they can live in a collection of photos and one long JSON dump file that I'll probably never read again.</p>
<p>If you want to find me I'm on Signal and Quicksy (an XMPP-based service using phone numbers and OMEMO for encryption). If you have my phone number you can use these services to get a hold of me. I'm still on IRC and have accounts on other platforms. But what seems a constant is that communication will be fractured over multiple platforms and the dream of having one application doing everything well dies on July, 2021. And the irritation of having yet-another-platform to talk to that one person is the reality we'll all have to deal with until something better comes along. Nothing is perfect and everything is terrible.</p>
<p>RIP Hangouts. You helped me not have to think about messaging.</p>

      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>One user of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/signal-hook">signal-hook</a> crate expressed an interest in knowing the PID and
UID of the process that sent the signal. As a general idea I liked it. The
low-level <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction</code></a> does indeed provide this information and it might be
useful (more than once I have wondered why the program terminated because
<em>someone</em> sent it a <code>SIGTERM</code>, but the logs contained no information about what
other process it was; knowing its PID is the first step to figuring it out,
though I don’t know of a nice portable way to convert a PID to a name of a
process or something of similar usability). In fact, I had a long-standing open
issue on the repository about being able to somehow make the additional
information in the <code>siginfo_t</code> structure available.</p>

<p>So I’ve decided to give it a go and implement it. In fact, I’ve already had the
place in the API this would plug in that would make it immediately available to
all the <code>signal-hook-*</code> asynchronous add-ons too, not only the iterator inside
<code>signal-hook</code>.</p>

<p>For a few reasons, this turned out to be a bigger challenge than I expected.</p>

<h2 id="the-usual-async-signal-safe-trouble">The usual async-signal-safe trouble</h2>

<p>Inside the signal handler, one can do almost nothing. It’s because it can happen
on whatever thread at any time, so one can’t allocate in there (what if that
thread was actually in the middle of some allocator routine with inconsistent
thread-local data structures), can’t lock stuff (the lock could be held by the
same thread, which would deadlock)… actually, there’s a
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html">list of functions</a> that can be used from the C standard
library, but calling anything else is UB.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://crates.io/crates/signal-hook">signal-hook</a> gives the user bunch of patterns how to postpone the reaction
to a signal for a later time, for once outside of the actual handler. There the
user can enjoy the full feature set of Rust or actually anything one can call
from it too. But it’s one thing to export „This signal happened at least once“
and another „This signal with <em>all this auxiliary information</em> happened“.  For
one, collating multiple instances of the first is losing much less information
than in the latter case. For another, the first is a single bit of information,
here we have much more.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, having something like a global <code>Mutex&lt;Vec&lt;Info&gt;&gt;</code> doesn’t
work (locking, allocations, …). Having a static mutable variable doesn’t
either, because the same signal can happen on two different threads at the same
time (thank you, POSIX!, you’re not making it any easier).</p>

<p>The good news is, atomic variables work. The less good news is, all the
information I wanted to take out was more than 64 bits. And some of the
platforms signal-hook has in its CI don’t even have 64bit atomics! So encoding
everything into a 64bit number is not the right way.</p>

<p>I’ve had to implement a kind of <a href="https://docs.rs/signal-hook/0.3.2/signal_hook/low_level/channel/struct.Channel.html">channel-like thing</a>. It has some
preallocated slots to store the information in and few atomic variables around
that to make sure two threads never write to the same one and that the reader
knows which slots to read things from. They do kind of locking, but instead of
blocking, the channel throws items out of the window if it is full. There’s
nothing much better it could do, clearly it is not possible to allocate and if
the reader end doesn’t keep up, any kind of preallocated capacity will get
exhausted eventually.</p>

<p>Also, the signal only provides storage of the data, not any kind of wakeup (but
other parts of that crate already supply that).</p>

<h2 id="reading-data-out-of-signinfo_t">Reading data out of <code>signinfo_t</code></h2>

<p>So the kernel gives us a nice <code>siginfo_t</code> structure we can read any and all the
extra information we are interested in. But there’s a catch. The POSIX standard
gives <em>a lot</em> of room for interpretation of how that structure should look like.</p>

<p>Citing from the manual page of <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>si_signo, si_errno and si_code are defined for all signals.  (si_errno is
generally unused on Linux.)  The rest of the struct may be a union, so that
one should read only the fields that are meaningful for the given signal:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, so if I’m reading this correctly, we get this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>si_signo</code>, which is the same as the signal number we already got. So not
really useful.</li>
  <li><code>si_errno</code>, which is useless on Linux at least (might be useful somewhere
else).</li>
  <li><code>si_code</code> which tells us what caused the signal to happen (was it sent by the
kernel, or some process, or was it caused by a timer, …). We actually <em>need</em>
that to access some other fields, otherwise they might not be there because of
some union style optimization to make the <em>temporary on-stack</em> structure a
tiny bit smaller. If we access them and they are not there, it may even be an
UB (who knows at this point, it’s interaction of C and Rust, better not even
try).</li>
</ul>

<p>We <em>would</em> be interested in the <code>si_pid</code> and <code>si_uid</code> fields. According to the
<a href="https://docs.rs/libc/0.2.81/libc/struct.siginfo_t.html"><code>libc::siginfo_t</code></a> documentation, there are methods for these (not fields,
because of <code>union</code>s). And they are <code>unsafe</code>, apparently because we first have to
check the <code>si_code</code> (their unsafety is not explicitly documented, but one can
assume).</p>

<h3 id="the-si_-constants">The <code>SI_*</code> constants</h3>

<p>Long story short, while Rust’s <code>libc</code> bindings give one access to the <code>si_code</code>
field, it doesn’t export the actual constants to know what that value means.
While the maintainers are generally open to adding these constants, I don’t have
access to all the large number of platforms to figure out what values the
constants have on each (yes, they are not the same) and what constants are even
available on each of them (for example the <code>SI_KERNEL</code> seems to be available
only on Linux).</p>

<p>If you get the idea in the lines of „Well, I’m interested in <code>SIGINT</code>, where
else could that come from than from other process“, then it’s worth mentioning
that if you press <code>CTRL+C</code> in a terminal, it is the kernel that sends the signal
on behalf of that PTY, not the terminal emulator. At least on Linux, you’ll get
<code>SI_KERNEL</code> and no PID or UID, therefore that idea is maybe leading to UB.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <code>si_pid</code> and such methods are not available on all the
platforms <a href="https://crates.io/crates/signal-hook">signal-hook</a> compiles on.</p>

<p>So while the theoretically <em>right</em> way to move forward would be to go over a lot
of platforms and extend <code>libc</code> with each of them, it would take far more time
than what I have available. As a workaround, I’ve decided to write a minimal
extraction code in C (which has access to the actual platform C headers,
including the ability to detect if some constant exists by <code>#ifdef</code>s).</p>

<p>As having a working C toolchain available may be a bit of a pain (certainly in
some cross-compiling situations), and it adds another dependency (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/cc"><code>cc</code></a>), this
decoding ability is gated behind a feature flag.</p>

<h3 id="macos-and-the-si_code">MacOS and the <code>si_code</code></h3>

<p>To add insult to injury, apparently on MacOS the <code>si_code</code> field is there, the
constants are there, but the kernel <em>does not set them</em>. The field is always 0.
As a small compensation, the structure is not an union, so we <em>can</em> read the
fields of that structure no matter how the signal happened. In case there’s no
information about a process, both these fields are set to 0.</p>

<p>So in an effort to unify these things a little bit, there’s a special case for
MacOS to deal with this. Users of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/signal-hook">signal-hook</a> don’t need to worry about this…
well, it probably is technically not a violation of the POSIX standard, the
standard is just implemented in a very not useful way. But parts of the
information won’t be available on MacOS.</p>

<h3 id="how-reliable-it-is">How reliable it is</h3>

<p>I’ve done manual testing on Linux, the CI does some automated testing on few
platforms (actually checking the value of the extracted PID) and compiles on
many more. So it should work.</p>

<p>But because some information is platform specific, generally unknown situations
are reported as <code>Unknown</code> and it is possible the kernel or the library
consolidated multiple same signals into one, the extracted information should be
mostly informative (interesting info in logs, for example). That is, if one gets
some information, it should be correct, but it is not guaranteed to always get
useful stuff.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>Now you can get the information about where the signal came from, something like
this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>signal_hook</span><span>::</span><span>consts</span><span>::</span><span>TERM_SIGNALS</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With first CTRL+C in terminal, then sending a signal with <code>killall</code>, the output
would look something like this (yes, it would be nicer if that signal got
translated to something like <code>SIGTERM</code> instead of the number, I’ll see about
that in the future):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[src/main.rs:10] signal = Origin {
    signal: 2,
    process: None,
    cause: Kernel,
}
[src/main.rs:10] signal = Origin {
    signal: 15,
    process: Some(
        Process {
            pid: 25540,
            uid: 1000,
        },
    ),
    cause: Sent(
        User,
    ),
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When dealing with C++ APIs, one expects that C++ can express some things that
are not reasonably easy to translate to Rust and may need some kind of C++-side
wrapper to make it usable.</p>

<p>It seems C and the POSIX standard has some of these dark corners where the best
option is to adapt a similar strategy too. It’s not too hard to pull it off, but
it’s a bit extra work and relies on having a C compiler available.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p><em>This is Part 4 of a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/a-framework-for-putting-mental-models-to-practice/">series of posts</a> on putting mental models to practice. In <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/a-framework-for-putting-mental-models-to-practice-part-1/">Part 1</a> I described my problem with Munger’s approach to mental models after I applied it to my life. In <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/putting-mental-models-to-practice-part-2-introduction-to-rationality/">Part 2</a> I argued that the study of rationality is a good place to start for a framework of practice. We learnt that <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Farnam Street’s list of mental models</a> consists of three types of models: descriptive models, thinking models concerned with judgment (epistemic rationality), and thinking models concerned with decision making (instrumental rationality). In <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/putting-mental-models-to-practice-part-3-better-trial-and-error/">Part 3</a>, we were introduced to the search-inference framework for thinking, and discussed how mental models from instrumental rationality may help prevent the three errors of thinking as prescribed by the search-inference framework. We also took a quick detour to look at optimal trial and error through the eyes of Marlie Chunger. In Part 4, we will explore the idea that expertise leads to its own form of decision making. This is where my views begin to diverge from Farnam Street’s.</em></p><p>Many experts, in many fields, don’t do the sort of thinking we have explored in our previous part. They don’t do rational choice analysis. They don’t do expected utility calculations. &nbsp;They don’t adjust for biases, they don’t do appropriate search-inference thinking and they don’t use a ‘latticework of mental models from other fields’ to draw inferences.</p><p>And yet, despite a lack of grounding in the ‘best practices’ of decision science, they appear to perform remarkably well in the real world.</p><p>So what do they do?</p><p>They do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_primed_decision">recognition-primed decision making</a>.</p><p>Recognition-primed decision making (henceforth called RPD) is a <em>descriptive</em> model of decision-making: that is, it describes how humans make decisions in real world environments. RPD is one of the thinking models from the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_decision-making">Naturalistic Decision Making</a> (NDM), which is concerned with how practitioners <em>actually</em> make decisions on the job. NDM researchers eschew the lab and embed themselves in organisational settings, and take an almost anthropological approach to research. They follow firefighters on calls, sit in tanks during military exercises, and interview interface designers and programmers in the office, during work tasks. The way the researchers do this is to use an interviewing technique they call Cognitive Task Analysis, which is designed to draw out <em>tacit mental models of expertise</em>.</p><p>NDM is interesting to us because it represents an alternative school of thought to conventional decision analysis. The growth of the cognitive biases and heuristics research program has created a number of prescriptive models — rooted in expected utility theory — designed to help us make more ‘rational’ decisions. We’ve covered the basics of that approach in <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/putting-mental-models-to-practice-part-3-better-trial-and-error/">Part 3</a>. But the cognitive biases and heuristics program has also sucked up a lot of attention in recent years. We continually hear endless stories about the fallibility of human judgment and the errors and biases that systematically cloud our thinking. Whatever popular science books have to say about NDM is limited to the sort of ‘magical intuition’ as portrayed by Malcolm Gladwell in <em>Blink</em>.</p><p>This is a terrible portrayal. Because expert intuition is often portrayed as ‘magical’, we ignore it and turn to more rational, deliberative modes of decision making. We do not believe that intuition can be trained, or replicated. We think that rational choice analysis is the answer to everything, and that amassing a large collection of mental models in service of the search-inference framework is the ‘best’ way to make decisions.</p><p>It is telling, however, that the US military uses RPD models for training and analysis of battlefield decision-making situations. The field of NDM arose out of psychologist Gary Klein’s work, done in the 90s, for the US Army Research Institute for the Behavioural and Social Sciences. In the 70s and the 80s, the US Government had spent millions on decision science research — that is, on <em>conventional</em> models rooted in rational choice analysis — and used these findings to develop expensive decision aids for battle commanders.</p><p>The problem they discovered was that nobody actually used these aids in the real world. The army had spent ten years worth of time and money on research that didn’t work at all. It needed a new approach. <em>(Chapter 2, Gary Klein, Sources of Power)</em>.</p><h2 id="how-experts-make-decisions">How Experts Make Decisions</h2><p>RPD describes the decision making that emerges from expertise. This is a huge differentiating factor; the majority of results in classical decision science was built on behavioural experiments performed on ordinary people. The model goes as follows:</p><p>Let’s say that an expert encounters a problem in the real world. The first step in the RPD model is recognition: that is, the expert perceives the situation in a changing environment and pattern matches it against a collection of prototypes. The more experience she has, the more prototypes or analogues she has stored in her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory">implicit memory</a>.</p><p>This instantly generates four things. The first is a set of ‘expectancies’ — the expert has some expectations for happens next. For instance, in a firefighting environment, an experienced firefighter can tell where a fire would travel, and how a bad situation might develop. An experienced computer programmer can glance at some code and tell if the chosen abstraction would lead to problems months down the road. A manager can hear two pieces of information during lunch and predict production delays two months in the future.</p><p>The second thing this recognition generates is a set of <em>plausible goals</em> — that is, priorities of what needs to be accomplished. In a life-or-death situation, a platoon commander has to prioritise between keeping his troop alive, getting to advantageous cover, and achieving mission objectives. His recognised prototype instantly tells him where his priorities lie in a given situation, freeing cognitive resources to conduct other forms of thinking.</p><p>The third thing that is generated is a set of relevant cues. A novice looking at a chaotic situation will not notice the same things that the expert does. Noticing cues to evaluate a changing environment is one of the benefits of experience — and it is necessary in order to prevent information overload. Think of driving a car: in the beginning, you find yourself overwhelmed with the number of dials and knobs and mirrors you have to keep track of. After a few months, you do these things intuitively and notice only select cues in your environment as you drive.</p><p>Last, but not least, a sequence of actions is generated by the expert, sometimes called an ‘action script’ — and it presents itself, fully formed, in the expert’s head.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2019/01/Paper.Commonplace.42.png" alt=""></figure><p>The fact that RPD depends so much on implicit memory means that this entire process happens in a blink of an eye. Consider how you might recognise a person walking into the room as your friend ‘Mary’ or ‘Joe’. Facial recognition is an implicit memory task: the information ‘magically’ makes itself known to you. Similarly, an expert confronted with a work-related problem will perform the recognition and generate the four by-products instantaneously. When initially interviewing firefighters, Klein’s researchers found that the firefighters would often assert that they were <em>not</em> decision making: instead, they arrived at the scene of a fire and knew immediately what to do.</p><p>This is, of course, not a complete picture. What happens when the situation is unclear, or when the initial diagnosis is flawed? Here’s a story from <em>Sources of Power</em> to demonstrate what happens next:</p><blockquote>“The initial report is of flames in the basement of a four-story apartment building: a one-alarm fire. The commander arrives quickly and does not see anything. There are no signs of smoke anywhere. He finds the door to the basement, around the side of the building, enters, and sees flames spreading up the laundry chute. That’s simple: a vertical fire that will spread straight up. Since there are no external signs of smoke, it must just be starting.<p>The way to fight a vertical fire is to get above it and spray water down, so he sends one crew up to the first floor and another to the second floor. Both report that the fire has gotten past them. The commander goes outside and walks around to the front of the building. Now he can see smoke coming out from under the eaves of the roof. It is obvious what has happened: the fire has gone straight up to the fourth floor, has hit the ceiling there, and is pushing smoke down the hall. Since there was no smoke when he arrived just a minute earlier, this must have just happened.</p><p>It is obvious to him how to proceed now that the chance to put out the fire quickly is gone. He needs to switch to search and rescue, to get everyone out of the building, and he calls in a second alarm. The side staircase near the laundry chute had been the focus of activity before. Now the attention shifts to the front stairway as the evacuation route.”</p></blockquote><p>Where were the decisions here? The firefighter sees a situation — a vertical fire — and immediately knows what to do. But a few seconds later, he cancels that diagnosis because he recognises a different situation, and orders a different set of actions.</p><p>In rational choice theory, the firefighter is not making any decisions at all because he is not comparing between possibilities. He is simply reading the environment and taking action. Klein and co argue that decisions are still made, however: at multiple points in the story, the firefighter could have chosen from an array of options. The fact that he merely considers one option at each decision point doesn’t mean he <em>didn’t</em> make a decision — it is simply that he considers his options in linear fashion, finds the first that is satisfactory, and then acts on it.</p><p>There are two conclusions from looking at this process. The first is to conclude that when we make decisions, we naturally <em>look at our options one at a time.</em> It just so happens that the first option an expert practitioner generates is …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apparently, I've got a theme going of Weird Syntax. Let's run with it.</p>

<p>Konrad Zuse was an early pioneer in computer science, although his name is perhaps somewhat less well-known than others. Zuse holds the honor of having built the first programmable computer—-the Z3—-back in the 40's, as well as several other computing firsts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>. Of particular interest to this blog post is his early unimplemented programming language, Plankalkül.</p>

<p>Plankalkül was, like the Z3, in many respects ahead of its time. Zuse's explicit goal was to be able to describe programs at a high level, which meant he included control structures and datatype definitions<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup> and other high-level constructs that were often missing in languages of the early years of computing. Zuse was working on Plankalkül at a time when his machines were not useable, which meant that his language work was more theoretical than it was technical, and consequently he allowed features that he wasn't entirely sure how to program. Despite his notes on it having been written in the mid-40's, they were not published until the 70's, and it was not implemented until the year 2000.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me, as I read programs in this notation that had been set down on a typewriter<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>, is that certain kinds of grouping were handled by explicit indication of scope: not via matched delimiters as in ALGOL-style languages, or via indentation in languages such as Python and Haskell, but by formatting the code so that a line bordered on the left of the scoped parts of the code:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/static/zuse-01.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is meant to capture the way grouping works in the hand-written or typeset notation, with brackets spanning multiple lines:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/static/zuse-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I think this is notationally interesting: it's like Python's significant whitespace, but not, uh, whitespace. It would be incredibly tedious to type out, but still entirely compatible with current programming notation:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 | @staticmethod
 | def new_tet()
 |  | n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 |  | for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 |  |  | if p in Board.permanent
 |  |  |  | Game.lose()
 |  | Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 |
 | def __init__(self, points, color)
 |  | self.points = points
 |  | self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>and would be entirely amenable to beautifying via judicious application of Unicode:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 ┃ @staticmethod
 ┃ def new_tet()
 ┃  ┃ n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 ┃  ┃ for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 ┃  ┃  ┃ if p in Board.permanent
 ┃  ┃  ┗  ┗ Game.lose()
 ┃  ┗ Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 ┃
 ┃ def __init__(self, points, color)
 ┃  ┃ self.points = points
 ┃  ┗ self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at this notation, however, an interesting possibility struck me: a programmer could explicit annotate information about the <em>kind of scope</em> involved in a given line. In this Python-like example, I could, for example, distinguish class scope using double lines, function scope with thick lines, and control structure scope with thin lines:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 ║ @staticmethod
 ║ def new_tet()
 ║  ┃ n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 ║  ┃ for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 ║  ┃  │ if p in Board.permanent
 ║  ┃  └  └ Game.lose()
 ║  ┗ Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 ║
 ║ def __init__(self, points, color)
 ║  ┃ self.points = points
 ║  ┗ self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage of this scheme is that a handful of lines, viewed in isolation, still give you a clear view of what surrounds them. For example, I can view these two lines in isolation and still tell that they are within a control structure used within a function declared within a class:</p>

<pre><code> ║  ┃  │ if p in Board.permanent
 ║  ┃  └  └ Game.lose()
</code></pre>

<p>You could also imagine a hypothetical language in which choice of scope delimiter is important. In Python, <code>for</code> and <code>if</code> do not form a new lexical scope. What if instead we could stipulate the kind of scope they form by this notational convention?</p>

<pre><code>def okay()
 ┃ if True
 ┃  └ n = 5   # n is declared in function scope
 ┗ return n   # n leaks out of the if-scope

def not_okay()
 ┃ if True
 ┃  ┗ n = 5   # n is declared in the if's scope
 ┗ return n   # error: no n in scope here
</code></pre>

<p>That being said, there are a number of reasons that this notation is in inferior to existing notations:</p>
<ul><li>It makes refactoring code <em>much</em> more difficult.</li>
<li>It requires that the programmer <em>pay attention</em> to the sequence of enclosing scopes on a <em>line-by-line</em> basis, which is generally too pedantic and not particularly useful for a programmer.</li>
<li>The ability to select “which kind of scope” is by no means only expressible by this notation, as other syntactic features such as keywords and delimiters could express the same thing.</li>
<li>There are only so many line-like characters which can serve as a scope marker, so this scheme is not very extensible.</li>
<li>It complicates parsing (especially by introducing an entirely new class of parse errors in which adjacent lines feature incompatible sequences of delimiting lines), and so it also...</li>
<li>Complicates parse <em>error messages</em>, which are an important part of a language's UI and should be considered seriously.</li></ul>

<p>So, as in my previous post on <a href="https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/2014/8/noun-case" rel="nofollow">grammatical case in programming languages</a>, I urge readers <em>not</em> to use this notation as the concrete syntax for a programming language. This is merely an entertaining peek through the looking glass at a curious notational convention which was never adopted.</p>

<p>That said: this makes a very nice notation for <em>viewing</em> code, where the programmer does not have to explicitly draw ASCII art around their code; indeed, it bears more than a passing similarity to the graphical interface used in <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Scratch</a>, and Sean McDirmid's <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liveprogramming/typography.aspx" rel="nofollow">Experiments in Code Typography</a> features this very convention as an interactive ornament on code in a Python-like language.</p>

<h2>The Arrival of a Train</h2>

<p>Release date: January 25, 1896<br>
Directed by: Auguste Lumière, Louis Lumière<br>
Stars: Madeleine Koehler, Marcel Koehler, Mrs. Auguste Lumiere, etc.<br>
Running time: 50 seconds<br>
Country: France<br>
Language: Silent</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.the-classic-movies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Arrival-of-a-Train-1896-200x300.jpg" alt="The-Arrival-of-a-Train-(1896)" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.the-classic-movies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Arrival-of-a-Train-1896-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.the-classic-movies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Arrival-of-a-Train-1896.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></p>
<p>There is nothing exciting about an arriving train, but somehow it became an iconic scene in cinematic history. Produced by pioneering French filmmakers Auguste and Louis Lumière, it was the first scene that was ever shown to public. Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat was filmed in France at the end of 1895 and was shown in 1896. The 50-second long film captures the gradual approach of a train, its slow stop and the disembarking of its passengers. The arrival of a train produces little of interest in terms of actual content but it has more of interest in its historical and cultural context.</p>
<p>It is interesting that this scene, that is really simple and casual for us today, made a great affect on people, they said it was all realistic and it was a great power of illusion. Almost everyone heard the story about people who was watching that scene for the first time back then in 1896, they was scared and ran out. In fact, there was no real mass panic. But French scientist Henri de Parville, who attended an early screening, wrote: «One of my neighbors was so much captivated that she sprung to her feet… and waited until the car disappeared before she sat down again.» It shows us that it was a miracle alive for people back then and it is hard to imagine what they were felling during the screening of «The arrival of a train» in January, 1896.</p>
<p>Auguste and Louis Lumière obviously recognized the power of illusion that they had. In order to maximize the affect of the approaching train they mounted their camera as close as possible to the edge of platform, so that the audience feels as if they stand right on the locomotive’s path. People in the scene are just normal citizens that stand on the platform, so it makes us believe that all of that is real. So since we have nothing in common with the first audiences, we may understand that it was something magical for people back then.</p>
<p>Moreover, this scene makes a great affect today, but not as a cinematic miracle, but as a history. On a surface level we watch a train arrives but what we are really witnessing is the arrival of cinema. Nowadays we understand what cinematography is and, in fact, it is not a film in our today comprehension, but it is always interesting to see how it all started and to trace its development.</p>
<p>«The arrival of a train» is not just a short scene or a film, but it is a window between past and present. It is a possibility to see what people looked like, because photos and pictures are good things, but when we look at this scene we feel that we are with that people, that they are alive and we understand what they were wearing in those days, we can see their appearance.</p>
<p>Summing up, we can say that Auguste and Louis Lumière weren’t really artists. Their early films don’t stand up to the highly imaginative movies of George Méliès for example. But they still remain very important cinema giants. Not for the content of their films but for the fact that they kicked things off in the first place and produced the first iconic moment in cinema history. And for this reason «L’arrivée d’un train a La Ciotat» will always be remembered. Everyone who has a love of cinema should really take a minute of their time to pay attention to the first moment in an amazing thing called cinematography.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We’re extending GHC with linear types.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ever since Jean-Yves Girard discovered <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(87)90045-4">linear logic</a> in
1986, researchers around the world have been going “wow! resource
tracking, this must be useful for programming languages”. After all,
any real computation on a real machine <em>takes</em> resources (memory
pages, disk blocks, interrupts, buffers etc) that then aren’t
available anymore unless restored somehow. But despite this match
apparently made in heaven, research on this subject has remained
largely theoretical. It was becoming easy to just give up and assume
this nut was simply too tough to crack. We ourselves have been there,
but we recovered: we’re having a go at extending GHC with linear
types.</p>
<p>Great! But why is this useful in a high-level programming language
like Haskell? You’ll find the long of it in the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-types/releases/download/v1.0/hlt.pdf">paper</a> we just
submitted to ICFP’17 with Mathieu Boespflug, Ryan Newton and Simon
Peyton Jones. In this blog post, we’ll briefly discuss (more in the
paper) how we’re trying to achieve more predictable performance at
a smaller memory footprint in Haskell, and give you a preview of what
you might expect in your favourite compiler in the not-so-distant
future.</p>
<h2>A bit of history</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, Jean-Yves Girard was playing with ways to describe
the semantics of a λ-calculus with types, when he realised that from
a semantic perspective there was nothing essential about the arrow
type (the type for functions): it could be described in terms of two
simpler constructions. He followed this thread through and came up
with a strange beast he called <em>linear logic</em>.</p>
<h3>Two of everything</h3>
<p>Linear logic had two of everything: two ways of building conjunctions
and disjunctions, two notions of truth, falsehood and two ways to
negate. It’s a strange system, but perhaps not more so than the zoo of
cute names and symbols Girard conferred to every construct. For the
purposes of this post, we’ll only need one new symbol from this zoo:
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊸</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">⊸</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which reads <em>lollipop</em> (also called <em>linear arrow</em>, or <em>lolly</em>
for close friends).</p>
<p>If we transpose linear logic to describing the behaviour of programs
(by which point we talk about <em>linear types</em>), the linear arrow says
this: a function that has type <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>⊸</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A⊸B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a function that has an <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
available to compute with, <em>but it can only use it once</em>. Not twice,
not zero times: just once. It turns out that this property, which has
come to be known as <em>linearity</em>, is very useful for compilers of
functional programs.</p>
<h3>Typing resources</h3>
<p>Programming language researchers quickly took notice. It was not long
before <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(88)90100-4">Yves Lafont</a> proposed a language with safe memory
management yet without needing a garbage collector, thanks to linear
types. Philip Wadler <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/linear/linear.ps.gz">piled on</a> a few years later
with a system also supporting state update while retaining the
properties of a pure language. Recently, researchers have even pushed
linear logic towards making it possible to reason about pointer
aliasing (the absence or presence of aliasing matters a lot in the
optimization and the correctness of C programs).</p>
<p>But despite all these early promises (and many more since then),
linear types didn’t catch on in the mainstream. Mind you, there have
been workarounds. It turns out linear types are also useful to model
effects, but Haskell preferred monads for that purpose
instead. <a href="http://clean.cs.ru.nl/">Clean</a> wanted safe mutable state,
but eschewed monads, using <em>uniqueness types</em> instead. More
recently, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> rose to popularity with
a system of ownership which is not unlike Clean’s uniqueness types.
Both are complex systems that permeate the entire language and
ecosystem in ways that make the learning curve pretty steep.</p>
<h3>Linear types as an extension</h3>
<p>What if you could enjoy all your favourite goodies from your favourite
programming language, and yet be able to leverage linear types for
precise resource management exactly where it matters (as Lafont did by
avoiding garbage collection)? The result won’t be as good as Rust for
what Rust does: it’s a different trade-off where we assume that such
precision is only needed in small key areas of a program that
otherwise freely uses functional programming abstractions as we know
them today.</p>
<p>This is what we are proposing: a simple, unintrusive design that can
be grafted to your favourite functional language at no cost for the
programmer. We’re working on GHC, but this would work just as well in
your favourite ML flavour.</p>
<h2>So why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>Among our many projects, we are working together
with <a href="http://seagate.com/">Seagate</a> and a number of consortium partners on
the <a href="http://sagestorage.eu/">SAGE</a> platform, an EU funded R&amp;D project exploring how to
store massive amounts of data (in excess
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte">one exabyte</a>) and query
this data efficiently. We use Haskell as a prototyping language to
fail fast when we’re heading towards a dead end, backtrack and explore
a different direction at low cost, and refactor our existing code
easily when we commit to a different direction.</p>
<p>On this and other systems level projects, maintaining predictable
latencies is key. Pusher <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/">recently documented</a> how this
matters to them too, to the point where they’ve
been <a href="https://making.pusher.com/golangs-real-time-gc-in-theory-and-practice/">looking elsewhere</a> for good latencies. Our use cases
share the same characteristics. We decided to solve the problem by
asking less of the GC, while extending Haskell to make working outside
of the GC just as memory safe. You will find much more details in
the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-types/releases/download/v1.0/hlt.pdf">paper</a>, but in summary linear types help in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can use linear types to manually, yet safely, manage data with
<code>malloc</code>: because linearity forces the programmer using a value at
least once, we can ensure that the programmer eventually calls
<code>free</code>. And because it forces to use a value at most once, we can
make sure that <code>free</code>-d data is never used (no use-after-free or
double-free bugs). Anything that we <code>malloc</code> explicitly doesn’t end
up on the GC heap, so doesn’t participate in increasing GC pause
times.</li>
<li>Linear types can make fusion <em>predictable</em> and <em>guaranteed</em>. Fusion
is crucial to writing programs that are <em>both</em> modular and
high-performance. But a common criticism, one that we’ve seen born
out in practice, is that it’s often hard to know for sure whether
the compiler seized the opportunity to fuse intermediate data
structures to reduce allocations, or not. This is still future work,
but we’re excited about the possibilities: since fusion leans
heavily on inlining, and since linear functions are always safe to
inline without duplicating work because they only use their argument
once, it should be possible with a few extra tricks to get
guaranteed fusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the story gets better still. Linear types aren’t only useful for
performance, they can also be key to correctness. SAGE is a complex
project with many communicating components. Linear types allow us to
model these interactions at the type level, to statically rule out
bugs where some component doesn’t respect the protocol that was agreed
upon with others. We don’t talk about that much in the paper, but
we’ll touch on that here.</p>
<h2>What it will look like</h2>
<p>Let’s start slow, with the <code>fst</code> function projecting the first
component from a pair:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fst</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>fst</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So far, so standard. Now here is a new thing you <em>cannot</em> do:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fst</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> ⊸ <span>a</span>
<span>fst</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊸</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">⊸</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the linear arrow: the type of functions which must use
their arguments exactly once. The first projection is <em>not</em> linear,
since a part of the pair is silently dropped. So the type checker will
reject this program. It will also reject the diagonal, which uses its
argument twice:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>dup</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> ⊸ <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>dup</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span>x</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>On the surface, this is almost the entire story: <em>the linear arrow
allows you to reject more programs</em>, of which <code>fst</code> and <code>dup</code> are
prototypical examples.</p>
<p>With that in mind, there’s a lot that linear types can be used for.
One example is strongly typed protocols that check applications in
a distributed system interact as expected. We’ll need a little bit of
kit first:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>S</span> <span>a</span>
<span>data</span> <span>R</span> <span>a</span>

<span>newCaps</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>R</span> <span>a</span> ⊸ <span>S</span> <span>a</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>send</span> <span>::</span> <span>S</span> <span>a</span> ⊸ <span>a</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>receive</span> <span>::</span> <span>R</span> <span>a</span> ⊸ <span>(</span><span>a</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this API, <code>S</code> is a <em>send capability</em>: it gives the ability to send
a message. <code>R</code> is a <em>receive capability</em>. A pair of corresponding
capabilities is allocated by <code>newCaps</code>. The important thing to notice
is that since both capabilities are linear, both must be <em>consumed</em>
exactly once by a <code>send</code> and a <code>receive</code> respectively. Conversely, you
can’t send/receive without having a corresponding send/receive
capability on hand.</p>
<p>As a first example, let’s consider a protocol where a server expects
two integers and returns the sum to the client. A simple function,
except happening across a wire. This protocol is fully captured by the
type <code>(Int, Int, Int ⊸ IO ())</code>, which reads: receive two <code>Int</code>’s, then
send an <code>Int</code>. Using <code>⊸ IO ()</code> switches between “send” and “receive”.</p>
<p>To implement a protocol <code>P</code>, one has to write an implementation (a
function) of type <code>P ⊸ IO ()</code>. The other side of the wire (the client)
must implement the dual protocol <code>P ⊸ IO ()</code>, with a function of type
<code>(P ⊸ IO ()) ⊸ IO ()</code>:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>P</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>server</span> <span>::</span> <span>P</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>k</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>

<span>client</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>P</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> ⊸ <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>client</span> <span>sendToSrvr</span> <span>=</span> <span>newCaps</span> <span>$</span> <span>\</span><span>r</span> <span>s</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>sendToSrvr</span> <span>(</span><span>42</span><span>,</span> <span>57</span><span>,</span> <span>send</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
  <span>receive</span> <span>r</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>n</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can see how typing works: <code>client</code> must create a function <code>Int ⊸ IO ()</code> for the server to send its result to. So it creates an <code>S</code>/<code>R</code>
pair, into which the server will be able to send exactly one result.
The <code>r</code> capability must also be consumed exactly once. Therefore, the
client must call <code>receive</code> and do something with the result (in this
case, it boringly prints it on a console).</p>
<p>Of course, one can replace all the linear arrows with regular arrows
<code>-&gt;</code> and the program stays well-typed. But <em>the value of linear types
lies in what they do not allow</em>: <code>client</code> cannot forget to call
<code>receive</code>, resulting in the server blocking on <code>send</code>; similarly, the
server is not allowed to return twice to <code>k</code> (<em>e.g.</em> <code>k (n+p) &gt;&gt; k (n*p)</code> is not well-typed). This prevents all sort of bad
behaviours. It is not a novel idea; see the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-types/releases/download/v1.0/hlt.pdf">paper</a>’s “related work”
section if you’re interested in the references.</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
    State machine replication protocols, like MultiPaxos and Raft, are a
    critical component of many distributed systems and databases. However,
    these protocols offer relatively low throughput due to several bottlenecked
    components. Numerous existing protocols fix different bottlenecks in
    isolation but fall short of a complete solution. When you fix one
    bottleneck, another arises. In this paper, we introduce
    compartmentalization, the first comprehensive technique to eliminate state
    machine replication bottlenecks. Compartmentalization involves decoupling
    individual bottlenecks into distinct components and scaling these
    components independently. Compartmentalization has two key strengths.
    First, compartmentalization leads to strong performance. In this paper, we
    demonstrate how to compartmentalize MultiPaxos to increase its throughput
    by 6x on a write-only workload and 16x on a mixed read-write workload.
    Unlike other approaches, we achieve this performance without the need for
    specialized hardware. Second, compartmentalization is a technique, not a
    protocol. Industry practitioners can apply compartmentalization to their
    protocols incrementally without having to adopt a completely new protocol.

<h3><strong>Conclusions</strong> from the Academic Research</h3>



<p>We looked at research papers from the last 30 years to evaluate our set of teaching strategies undertaken in our Japanese language learning application called <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.  We found that the scholarly and academic studies referred to confirm:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Kanji [logographs of mainland Asian origin] are categorized as the main impediment in acquisition of the Japanese language</strong> and anything to ease their acquisition from rote-memorization will help learners greatly.</li><li><strong>Computer aided learning of Japanese is superior to textbook-based</strong> learning <strong>when</strong> <strong>paired with timely and useful feedback</strong> for the learner, with politeness language, grammar, kanji, and more. [4, 5, 7, 12, 17]</li><li><strong>Kanji are processed by different parts of the brain compared to English letters and Hiragana mora,</strong> suggesting that placing special emphasis on learning Kanji as glyphs or <em>graphics with associated meanings <strong>first</strong></em> establishes a firm foundation upon which to then learn readings and pronunciations. [2, 6]</li><li>Kanji have <em>logographic</em> as well as <em>phonographic</em> value; <strong>cultural, etymological, and mnemonic strategies are not only more effective than rote-memorization strategies for learning, they also remove a lot of anxiety and perceived inscrutability of kanji, making kanji learning fun and intriguing</strong> instead of a chore.  The main techniques presented in these papers include component-analysis of kanji [what we call subkanji learning], and pairing kanji with graphical and mnemonic aides such as stories or imaginal scenes. [6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15]</li><li>It is very likely that native speakers of languages featuring kanji create <em>some sort</em> of meaning-word associated with each kanji, whether able to give voice to it or not (“unconscious knowledge”), suggesting strongly that <strong>by teaching kanji meaning-words first one is creating a very helpful and direct shortcut to their successful assimilation.</strong> [6, 9, 10]</li><li>One paper suggests the use of an “orthographic gradient” where terms are first shown as color-coded Hiragana, and later instances are shown as color-coded kanji using the same coloration, allowing learners to make an implied association of equality.  <strong>This idea of “orthographic gradient” confirms the efficacy of our innovative approach “Kanji in English Context” where we t取ke kanji and pl置ce them in an 英ngl語sh c文nt脈xt [take, place, English, context] to expedite acquisition</strong> and increase familiarity with the plurality of [English] words kanji can represent. [11, 16]</li><li><strong>Acquisition of Japanese grammar and sequence continues to be the most challenging part of learning the language for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students,</strong> suggesting that the focus for the first several semesters of learning ought be grammar-focused.  Nouns are acquired at a linear rate no matter the level of grammar competency, and thus it would suggest that the learning of nouns can actually be greatly delayed without any negative impact on comprehension; rather, focus on grammar first would result in greatly improved comprehension when nouns are later added to one’s cogent grammar understanding. </li><li><strong>Very Accurate Japanese Pitch Accent</strong> can be trained and learned swiftly with the right learning materials (showing pitch contours on screen and having learners listen and repeat). [17]</li><li><strong>One’s native language shapes how one acquires second+ languages.</strong> [3, 13]</li></ol>

<p>“Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain activation from Japanese readers reading hiragana (syllabic) and kanji (logographic) sentences, and English as a second language (L2). Kanji showed more activation than hiragana in right-hemisphere occipito-temporal lobe areas associated with visuospatial processing; hiragana, in turn, showed more activation than kanji in areas of the brain associated with phonological processing. L1 results underscore the difference in visuospatial and phonological processing demands between the systems. Reading in English as compared to either of the Japanese systems showed more activation in inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. The additional activation in English in these areas may have been associated with an increased cognitive demand for phonological processing and verbal working memory.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most important finding is that in all three languages that we have analysed acquisition appears to take place in two phases, during the first of which the child gradually acquires six to eight simple forms corresponding to ‘basic’ spatial meanings encoded in the target language.”</p>



<p>“In the second phase of acquisition, the child’s productive repertoire and the frequency of its use increase in a way that is reminiscent of (though perhaps less dramatic than) the ‘vocabulary explosion’ in nominal usage. The extension of the repertoire takes different courses, depending on the structure of the target language. In all languages it can be expected that the repertoire within the form class which is dominant in expressing spatial relational meaning will continue to expand, and that this will remain the most frequently employed vehicle for the child’s expression of spatial relational meaning throughout and perhaps beyond the third year of life.”</p>



<p>“In languages, such as Japanese, in which spatial relational meaning is overtly distributed over different form classes, the second phase will involve both an increase in the range of types controlled in the dominant form class (in this case,verbs), and the extension of the acquisition process to the other form classes (in this case, particles and nouns). Both the slow pace of acquisition in the non-dominant forms classes, and the fact that the meanings initially expressed using nouns are cognate with those already expressed using verbs, suggest that, in Japanese too, the learning process continues to be governed in the second phase by a conservative strategy. It can perhaps be seen as follows: the child employs the already acquired meanings as clues for the establishment of new centres in new form classes for the repetition with respect to these new form classes of the radial strategy already successfully employed with respect to the dominant form class.”</p>

From the experiment, we found the system provides the correct polite-expression based on hyponymy, social distance and situation through the identification of the target user and the location.

<p>“The results of the study show that given the same grammar notes and exercises, <strong>ongoing intelligent computer feedback is more effective than simple workbook answer sheets for developing learners’ grammatical skill in producing Japanese particles and sentences.</strong> A significant difference between Nihongo-CALI and the workbook instruction was observed in the production tests but not in the comprehension tests. This is consistent with Flynn’s hypothesis that grammatical competence is less critical in comprehension than in production. As suggested by Pederson and Dunkel, the present study also confirms that the use of a medium (i.e., computer) alone does not bring better effects; rather the quality of the messages produced by the medium affects the result. This is based on the fact that the intelligent version of Nihongo-CALI is significantly more effective than the workbook instruction”</p>

<p>Any compiler or transpiler is doing some form of program synthesis. But “proper” program synthesis usually means generation of high level programs from scratch, given only high level problem descriptions.</p>
<p>This post is about one of the most simple and straightforward methods of automatic program synthesis: inductive synthesis based on <strong>input-output examples</strong> specification and <strong>brute-force enumerative</strong> search.</p>
<h3>Synthesis task specification</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple example. Suppose that we want to automatically generate a program that reverses an array.</p>
<p>How to formulate this task for the automatic program generator? One option is to just describe it in natural language. But it would be quite hard to automatically parse and understand. A simpler way is to provide examples of inputs and expected outputs:</p>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] → [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</p>
<p>[5, 2, 7, 6] → [6, 7, 2, 5]</p>
<p>It's similar to a programmer working on a task using test-driven development, with a set of self-explanatory tescases.</p>
<h3>Brute-force search</h3>
<p>How to find a program that satisfies some input-output examples? There are several possible search strategies, but the simplest one is just with a brute force enumeration.</p>
<p>The idea is to generate all programs (within some size liimts and a limited language subset), and pick the first one that works correctly for all specified examples.</p>
<p>This is probably the least efficient approach of all, but with some additional optimizations and heuristics for reducing the search space it can actually be practical.</p>
<p>For example, an algorithm that won last year's synthesis competition <a href="https://sygus.org/comp/2019/">SyGuS-Comp 2019</a> in programming-by-examples track, is based on brute-force enumerative search strategy. As well as some previous years winners (<a href="#examples" id="ref1">EUSOLVER, Enumerative CEGIS Solver</a>). There are even some practical applications, for example brute-force search can be used for <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462174">synthesising distributed systems protocols</a>.</p>
<h3>Generating Javascript</h3>
<p>For generating and manipulating programs, code has to be represented as a data structure. This is not a problem in homoiconic languages like Lisp, but in Javascript it’s harder.</p>
<p>One simple idea (used, for example in miniMAL project <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL">https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL</a>), is to use JSON for representing programs. In this case, JSON arrays are serving as an analog of Lisp s-expressions.</p>
<p>Similar to an s-expression, each JavaScript expression is represented as a JSON array. First element is a function name, and the rest of elements are for function arguments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong></td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong></td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Math.pow(x, 2)</td>
   <td>["Math.pow", "x", 2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Math.pow(Math.sin(x), 2)</td>
   <td>[“Math.pow”, [“Math.sin”,  “x”], 2]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For operators, can use prefix notation:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>x = 2 + 2</td>
   <td>["=", x, ["+", 2, 2]]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>There are some special expressions formats: control flow, variables declaration.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let x = 1
   </td>
   <td> ["let", "x", 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) { console.log(i) }
   </td>
   <td>["for”, ”i”, ”0”, ”10”, ”1”,["block", [“console.log”, “i”]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>if (i &gt; 1) { i = 1; }
   </td>
   <td>["if", [“&gt;“, “i”, 1], ["block", [“=“, “i”, 1]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Also need syntax conventions for calling methods, accessing properties, and indexing arrays:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>let a = new Array(0, 1, 2)
   </td>
   <td>["let", "a", ["new Array", 0, 1, 2]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a.shift()
   </td>
   <td>[".shift", "a"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n1 = a.length
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n1", [".length_", "a"]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n2 = a[1]
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n2", ["get_index", a, 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a[1] = 2
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", a, 0, 0]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This allows to represent a wide range of possible JavaScript expressions, and covers all language features needed for a simple demo.</p>
<p>Code for transforming from JSON representation to Javascript is fairly simple. It just has to traverse arrays, print out expressions elements in correct order, and deal with code formatting.</p>
<h3>Simple DSL</h3>
<p>For brute-force search to be feasible, search space has to be limited to some restricted domain-specific language subset, which depends on the kind of the target problem.</p>
<p>For example, can design a simple DSL targeted for simple array processing. It should have functions for array access and manipulation, simple arithmetics, and control flow functions.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>function</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>subtract
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? - number??
   </td>
   <td>["-", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>add
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? + number??
   </td>
   <td>["+", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>greater than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &gt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&gt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>less than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &lt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&lt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>equal
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? == number??
   </td>
   <td>["==", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>array length
   </td>
   <td>number = array??.length
   </td>
   <td>[".length_", "array??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>get array element at index
   </td>
   <td>number = array??[number??]
   </td>
   <td>["get_index", "array??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>set array element at index
   </td>
   <td>array??[number??] = number
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for loop
   </td>
   <td>for (let i in array??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["for", "i", ["block", "??"], "in", "array??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>If condition
   </td>
   <td>if (boolean??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""],
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In the DSL description, "??" stands for an undefined value, that can be replaced with an expression or a variable. This notation is taken from <a href="#sketch" id="ref2">SKETCH language</a>, where "??" represents a <em>hole,</em> a placeholder that the synthesizer can replace with an integer constant.</p>
<p>Some undefined values have annotated types. For example "number??" means that the argument should be replaced with an expression that has "number" return value. This allows for additional limitations on the search space.</p>
<h3>Algorithm for program generation</h3>
<p>How to generate all programs that can be represented with the DSL? The algorithm is fairly simple: start with some undefined values, and iteratively replace them with all possible options picked from the list of DSL expressions. Selected and pasted expressions would contain some undefined values of their own, so the process is repeated until all the options are used, or until expressions tree depth reaches some limit.</p>
<p>It’s like iterative template rewriting, and it’s easier to demonstrate with an example:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
	<td>1. Start with an empty/undefined program </td>
	<td>["??", "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2. Traverse the expressions tree, and pick the first occurring undefined value </td>
	<td>[<span>"??"</span>, "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3. List all options for replacing this value (expressions that have an empty return type) </td>
	<td><span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span><br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]<br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4. Repace undefined value with the first option </td>
	<td>[<span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span>, "??", "??" ,"??"] </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively. Expressions tree is traversed depth-first, and each found leaf corresponds to a unique program. Press “next” button in the demo below, to see next iterations.</p>

<p>The demo below shows program generation for "array reversal" problem. Press “generate” button to see continuous generation, or use “next” to see generation steps. It generates and checks around a million of short programs per minute, and is able so solve the problem in ~10-20s. I tweaked the DSL to have a bare minimum of available expressions, for search to be faster. Size of the program is also limited by number of used varialbes (limited to 4). It would still work with larger more generic DSL, just would take more time.</p>

<p>Some more examples are show below. They also have custom DSLs tuned for each problem, so that it does not take too much time (~10-20s).</p>

<p>I have been using WhatsApp as my primary messaging application for communication with my family and friends all over the world. However, with the recent change in WhatsApp privacy policy, my partner and I started looking at alternatives.</p>
<p>We found it extremely difficult to find accurate information regarding apps that offer good privacy, especially for non-tech people. I hope you find this post useful for deciding which messaging application to use in a post-WhatsApp world.</p>

January 9, 2021 | https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/building-the-abseil-hello-bazel-project-for-a-different-architecture-using-a-dynamically-generated-toolchain/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/building-the-abseil-hello-bazel-project-for-a-different-architecture-using-a-dynamically-generated-toolchain/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p><a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> and <a href="https://www.buildstream.build/">BuildStream</a> are tools which are commonly used to organize and delegate the building of software. There are a few key differences between them but largely they are concerned with the same development problems. A more complete discussion of how the two can work together was presented by Daniel Silverstone at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21VPe7HcuPE&amp;feature=youtu.be">BazelCon 2019</a>.</p>
<p>In order to execute builds, Bazel requires a statically defined toolchain which must be built, deployed, and configured independently of the project. This is actually a strength of Bazel since it is toolchain-agnostic. However it necessarily introduces a burden on developers: they must develop some external mechanism to control, produce, and configure the toolchain with an acceptable level of confidence in the provenance and correctness to ensure a homogenous development experience across their organization. That must be duplicated for every toolchain required.</p>
<p>Buildstream was designed with a focus on system integration by leveraging existing build systems such as Bazel. In this way it is situated such that it can be used to integrate products from many different build systems. One of the main use cases from the Bazel developers perspective is the consumption of products from external builds without the need to develop bespoke rules such as <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc">rules_foreign_cc</a>, change the build of that project, or provide custom Bazel packaging for it. Toolchains provide a ready example of this type of problem.</p>
<p>The abseil-hello project provides a simple 'hello world' using Abseil's string-implementation library. This is provided with packaging for Bazel. A <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/abseil-hello-fork">fork</a> of abseil-hello with Bazel packaging has been developed that is built and executed remotely on an x86_64 host using a dynamically configured toolchain (<a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/bazel-toolchains-fdsdk">bazel-toolchains-fdsdk</a>) for both aarch64 and x86_64 targets. The toolchains themselves are specified by a BuildStream project; building and configuring them for Bazel is handled with minimal developer interaction by leveraging a new Bazel extension, <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/rules_buildstream">rules_buildstream</a>. Note that these specific toolchains are used for demonstration purposes only: any toolchain used for an actual project should produce binaries that are ABI-compatible with the execution platform and ABI-compatibility would be required with any linked libraries.</p>
<h2>rules_buildstream</h2>
<p>rules_buildstream is a Bazel extension providing a repository rule for loading BuildStream artifacts as an external repository. For example the BuildStream element <code>hello.bst</code> can be built and checked out in the path of Bazel external repositories by invoking <code>bst_element</code> in the WORKSPACE:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>bst_element(
    name = "my-bst-project",
    element = "hello.bst",
    project_dir = "/path/to/my-bst-project"
)
</pre></div>


<p>The Bazel label of the artifacts above is <code>my-bst-project</code> and the absolute path to the BuildStream project providing <code>hello.bst</code> is passed as a parameter.</p>
<p>When this workspace is loaded, Bazel delegates the build and artifact checkout of the <code>hello.bst</code> element to BuildStream via a shell. The output is then avaialable on the local filesystem in the path of the external repositories (addressable by <code>@my-bst-project//my-bst-project</code>) without requiring additional intervention. Additional configurations can also be passed to BuildStream via the <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/rules_buildstream/-/blob/ec2be0dd2dfd0d6505937c4aad8fef8f1141b62b/bst/defs.bzl#L163">rule parameters</a>.</p>
<h2>bazel-toolchains-fdsdk</h2>
<p>The bazel-toolchains-fdsdk project is an attempt to provide dynamic <code>rules_cc</code> toolchain configuration for Bazel for both aarch64 and x86_64 targets. The toolchains are defined as BuildStream projects and can be automatically built, deployed to the local system and configured for Bazel consumption.</p>
<p>The toolchain itself is defined by BuildStream elements which package the necessary binaries. The elements defining the toolchain are based on elements of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk">freedesktop-sdk project</a> which is consumed here as a BuildStream junction element. Because the entire toolchain is defined in BuildStream, specific versions of build tools can be controlled in source control methods such as git. Additionally the toolchain can be easily changed without affecting the Bazel configuration. For example executing a BuildStream build with <code>bst build toolchain-x86_64-deploy.bst</code> is sufficient to build the x86_64 toolchain with both good guarantee of provenance and correctness.</p>
<p>The configuration necessary for registering the toolchain with Bazel is provided by the <code>gen_build_defs()</code> rule:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>load("@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:gen_build_defs.bzl", "gen_build_defs")

gen_build_defs(
  name = "fdsdk",
  arch = "x86_64",
  archive = "@bazel-toolchain//bazel-toolchain",
  parent_repo = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo",
  build_template_file = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:BUILD.in",
  wrapper_template_file = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:wrapper.in",
)

register_toolchains("@fdsdk//:cc-toolchain")
</pre></div>


<p>In the above invocation, the <code>archive</code> is the label of the external repository providing the toolchain files. The toolchain can then be specified for a Bazel project using <code>--crosstool_top=@fdsdk//:fdsdk --cpu=x86_64</code> on the bazel cli or in a <code>.bazelrc</code> configuration.</p>
<h2>Building the abseil-hello project locally</h2>
<p>The abseil-hello Bazel <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/abseil-hello-fork/-/blob/20cab2d565632cf978bf6a3e662bea9991b02375/bazel-hello/WORKSPACE">WORKSPACE specification</a> has been modified to make use of both the dynamic toolchains and the BuildStream extension. The demo can be locally built for an x86_64 target using <code>--cpu=x86_64 --crosstool_top=@fdsdk//:fdsdk</code> and for an aarch64 target with <code>--cpu=aarch64 --crosstool_top=@fdsdk_aarch64//:fdsdk</code>.</p>
<p>Both <code>bst_element</code> and <code>gen_build_defs</code> are loaded via from external repositories using <code>git_repository</code> from the standard <code>@bazel_tools</code> repository.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

git_repository(
    name = "rules_buildstream",
    branch = "master",
    remote = "https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/rules_buildstream.git",
)

load("@rules_buildstream//bst:defs.bzl", "bst_element")

git_repository(
  name = "fdsdk_toolchain_repo",
  tag = "0.1.1",
  remote = "https://gitlab.com/Celduin/buildstream-bazel/bazel-toolchains-fdsdk",
)

load("@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:gen_build_defs.bzl", "gen_build_defs")
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, the <code>bazel-toolchains-fdsdk</code> project has been deployed to <code>/tmp</code>. Within that project, the toolchains are defined by the elements <code>toolchain-x86_64-deploy.bst</code> and <code>toolchain-aarch64-deploy.bst</code> for the x86_64 and aarch64 toolchains respectively. These elements are built and checked out as external repositories by invocation of <code>bst_element</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>bst_element(
  name = "bazel-toolchain",
  element = "toolchain-x86_64-deploy.bst",
  timeout = 14400,
  quiet = False,
  project_dir = "/tmp/bazel-toolchains-fdsdk",
)

bst_element(
  name = "aarch64-toolchain",
  element = "toolchain-aarch64-deploy.bst",
  timeout = 14400,
  quiet = False,
  project_dir = "/tmp/bazel-toolchains-fdsdk-arm",
)
</pre></div>


<p>The toolchains are subsequently available at <code>@&lt;name&gt;//&lt;name&gt;</code> (where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the value of the <code>name</code> parameter). Invocation of <code>gen_build_defs</code> automatically provides configuration for the toolchains which can be registered with Bazel as <code>cc-toolchains</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>gen_build_defs(
  name = "fdsdk",
  arch = "x86_64",
  archive = "@bazel-toolchain//bazel-toolchain",
  parent_repo = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo",
  build_template_file = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:BUILD.in",
  wrapper_template_file = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:wrapper.in",
)

gen_build_defs(
  name = "fdsdk_aarch64",
  arch = "aarch64",
  archive = "@aarch64-toolchain//aarch64-toolchain",
  parent_repo = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo",
  build_template_file = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:BUILD.in",
  wrapper_template_file = "@fdsdk_toolchain_repo//toolchain:wrapper.in",
)

register_toolchains("@fdsdk//:cc-toolchain")
register_toolchains("@fdsdk_aarch64//:cc-toolchain")

<p>The demo and the toolchains can be built remotely by a REAPI worker which has support for the Bazel and BuildStream clients. The <code>remote</code> endpoints in use in the pipeline were provided by the <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/infrastructure/celduin-infra">celduin-infra</a> project. At the time of writing this, these endpoints no longer exist. These can be reproduced in a container using <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/">kind</a> by following the instructions at <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/infrastructure/celduin-infra#deploying-locally">celduin-infra</a>.</p>
<p>The local BuildStream client is <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/abseil-hello-fork/-/blob/bd301c8bd46c3eff0948e0d9bb4cef489623e307/.gitlab-ci.yml#L19">configured for remote-execution</a>. The local Bazel client consumes a similar configuration specifying the worker:</p>

<p>Executing the build for the <code>rex</code> configuration then delegates the toolchain build and the construction of the hello-world project to the worker:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>bazel build --tls_client_key=<span>${</span><span>GITLAB_CAS_PUSH_KEY</span><span>}</span> --tls_client_certificate=<span>${</span><span>GITLAB_CAS_PUSH_CERT</span><span>}</span> --config=<span>${</span><span>ARCH</span><span>}</span> --config=rex :hello_main

<p>The log of this build for the aarch64 target can be seen at <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/abseil-hello-fork/-/jobs/654643209">https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/abseil-hello-fork/-/jobs/654643209</a>. The execution of the binary produced is then demonstrated at <a href="https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/abseil-hello-fork/-/jobs/654643212">https://gitlab.com/celduin/buildstream-bazel/abseil-hello-fork/-/jobs/654643212</a>.</p>
<h2>The BuildStream/Bazel ecosystem</h2>
<p>In this example, Buildstream is used to dynamically produce and configure an entire toolchain for Bazel. The definition of these toolchains is in a human readable form which is easily controlled using common SCMs such as git. Consequently the additional burden of building and configuring the toolchain is removed from the developer. Additionally, this example demonstrates that it is possible to delegate the toolchain build (and in fact the build of the entire project) to a remote worker. Combining this with remote caching can remove many of the issues of the heterogeneous developer environments across organizations: the …</p></section></div>

  </p>
  <p>GATs allow type parameters to associated types in traits. This feature enables total type-level functions to be associated to structs. I show how to use this pattern to implement higher-order type-level functions, and how to use specialization to make partial functions into total functions.</p>
  <p><em>Part of an ongoing series about type-level programming in Rust. Read <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/type-level-programming/">part one</a> first!<br></em></p>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1598-generic_associated_types.md">generic associated types</a> landing recently in Rust nightly, I’ve been wondering: what expressive power does this feature add to type-level programming? The answer is <strong>higher-order functions on types</strong>, and in this post I’ll explain what that means and how it works.</p>

<h2 id="a-refresher-on-type-level-programming">A refresher on type-level programming</h2>

<p>Using a pure functional programming style, we can define objects like a list of types. For example, using <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/tyrade">tyrade</a>, my type-level programming language:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>tyrade!</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>enum</span> <span>TList</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>TNil</span><span>,</span>
    <span>TCons</span><span>(</span><span>Type</span><span>,</span> <span>TList</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>enum</span> <span>TOption</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>TNone</span><span>,</span>
    <span>TSome</span><span>(</span><span>Type</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Get the Nth item from the list, where Index is either Z or S&lt;N&gt;</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>Nth</span><span>&lt;</span><span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Index</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>List</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>TNil</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TNone</span><span>,</span>
      <span>TCons</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>match</span> <span>Index</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Z</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TSome</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>),</span>
        <span>S</span><span>(</span><span>IMinusOne</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Nth</span><span>(</span><span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>IMinusOne</span><span>)</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// checks that Nth([i32, f32], 1) == Some(f32)</span>
  <span>assert_type_eq</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span>
    <span>Nth</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>TNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Z</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>TSome</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&gt;</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>tyrade!</code> procedural macro compiles the pseudo-Rust notation into a series of structs, traits, and impls. For example:</p>

<h2 id="higher-order-functions-on-types">Higher-order functions on types</h2>

<p>For me, Tyrade is a explicit representation of my mental model for type-level programming. Once I conceptually understood the correspondences between type-level enums and structs, or between type-level functions and traits, then I reified that understanding into the Tyrade compiler.</p>

<p>However, trait/function correspondence only worked when the arguments to type-level functions were types. To explain, we’ll use the running example of a list map function. The goal is to write it in Tyrade like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>tyrade!</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>List</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>TNil</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TNil</span><span>,</span>
      <span>TCons</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TCons</span><span>(</span><span>Func</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>),</span> <span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>Func</span><span>))</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we could use the <code>Map</code> type function like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>tyrade!</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>TIsZero</span><span>&lt;</span><span>N</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>N</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>Z</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TTrue</span><span>,</span>
      <span>S</span><span>(</span><span>N1</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TFalse</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert_type_eq</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span>
    <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span>
      <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Z</span><span>,</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Z</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>TNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
      <span>TIsZero</span>
    <span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TTrue</span><span>,</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TFalse</span><span>,</span> <span>TNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
  <span>&gt;</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, the existing translation of <code>Map</code> doesn’t work. It would become:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>List</span> <span>as</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Func</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>TNil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>TNil</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span> <span>XS</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>Func</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this code fails to compile because <code>Func</code> can’t be invoked with a parameter:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0109]: type arguments are not allowed for this type
    |
    |     type Output = TCons&lt;Func&lt;X&gt;, Map&lt;XS, Func&gt;&gt;;
    |                              ^ type argument not allowed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Herein lies the crux of the issue: type variables (i.e. impl quantifiers) are only allowed to be of kind <code>type</code>, and not of kind <code>type -&gt; type</code>. To get higher-order type functions, we need Rust to support higher-kinded types (HKT). While Rust doesn’t support HKT directly, the addition of generic associated types (GATs) enables a pseudo-HKT pattern. See <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/11/03/associated-type-constructors-part-2-family-traits/">Niko’s extended discussion</a> for the gory details.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-hofs-with-hkts-with-gats">Implementing HOFs with HKTs with GATs</h2>

<p><code>TIsZero</code> cannot be passed directly into <code>ComputeMap</code>, so the key idea is to create a proxy object <code>TIsZeroProxy</code> which can be passed in. Using GATs, we associate the <code>TIsZeroProxy</code> back to <code>TIsZero</code> in a way that can be referenced within <code>ComputeMap</code>. First, the proxy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>FuncProxy</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>TIsZeroProxy</span><span>;</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>FuncProxy</span> <span>for</span> <span>TIsZeroProxy</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>TIsZero</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the implementation of <code>ComputeMap</code> can be parameterized by any type implementing <code>FuncProxy</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>Proxy</span><span>:</span> <span>FuncProxy</span><span>,</span>
  <span>XS</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Proxy</span><span>::</span><span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this attempt still doesn’t quite work. We get an error in the implementation of <code>FuncProxy</code> for <code>TIsZeroProxy</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0277]: the trait bound `T: ComputeTIsZero` is not satisfied
    |
    |   type Func&lt;T&gt; = TIsZero&lt;T&gt;;
    |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `ComputeTIsZero` is not implemented for `T`
    |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why do we get this? Recall that <code>TIsZero&lt;T&gt;</code> is an alias for <code>&lt;T as ComputeTIsZero&gt;::Output</code>. This means that <code>T</code> must implement the <code>ComputeTIsZero</code> trait, which isn’t guaranteed by our general <code>FuncProxy</code> trait definition. We could theoretically change <code>FuncProxy</code> to include this bound, something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>FuncProxy</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, our goal is for <code>Map</code> to take as input any type-level function. This definition of <code>FuncProxy</code> would restrict the implement to only functions mentioned in the trait bounds.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-partial-functions">Dealing with partial functions</h2>

<p>Let’s back up to understand the conceptual issue. In Rust, type-level functions are partial functions, meaning they may not be implemented for all types. For example, <code>TIsZero</code> is only implemented for the types <code>Z</code> and <code>S&lt;N&gt;</code>, but not e.g. for the type <code>String</code>. However, to define <code>Map</code>, we have to ensure that <code>Proxy::Func&lt;X&gt;</code> is defined for all <code>X</code> in a type list.</p>

<p>Previously, we could ensure this condition via a trait bound. For example, if <code>Proxy::Func</code> was <code>ComputeTIsZero</code>, then we could add <code>X: ComputeTIsZero</code> to the implementation. But for any generic <code>Proxy::Func</code>, there is no way to say <code>X: Proxy::Func</code> because <code>Proxy::Func</code> is a type, not a trait. Hypothetically, if Rust supported <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2190">associated traits</a>, we could do something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>FuncProxy</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>trait</span> <span>Func</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>FuncProxy</span> <span>for</span> <span>TIsZeroProxy</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>trait</span> <span>Func</span> <span>=</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>CallProxy</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Proxy</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>as</span> <span>Proxy</span><span>::</span><span>Func</span><span>&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>XS</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>Proxy</span><span>:</span> <span>FuncProxy</span><span>,</span>
  <span>XS</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Proxy</span><span>::</span><span>Func</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>CallProxy</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Proxy</span><span>,</span> <span>X</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>XS</span><span>,</span> <span>Proxy</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, Rust doesn’t have such a feature. Instead, we can use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">specialization</a> to make all type functions total. We can define a base case where a type function returns an error if it’s not implemented, but as a type rather than a compiler error. To compile <code>TIsZero</code>, this solution looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Error</span><span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>FuncProxy</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>TIsZero</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>as</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span><span>&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span> <span>for</span> <span>Z</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>TTrue</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>N</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span> <span>for</span> <span>S</span><span>&lt;</span><span>N</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>TFalse</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>/* key addition */</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span> <span>for</span> <span>T</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>default</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>Error</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>TIsZeroProxy</span><span>;</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>FuncProxy</span> <span>for</span> <span>TIsZeroProxy</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>TIsZero</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this addition, the <code>TIsZeroProxy</code> implementation no longer errors, because <code>ComputeTIsZero</code> is guaranteed to be implemented for all types <code>T</code>. And now, at long last, our <code>Map</code> program will execute correctly if we replace <code>TIsZero</code> with <code>TIsZeroProxy</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert_type_eq</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span>
    <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span>
      <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Z</span><span>,</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Z</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>TNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
      <span>TIsZeroProxy</span>
    <span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TTrue</span><span>,</span> <span>TCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TFalse</span><span>,</span> <span>TNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
  <span>&gt;</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: as of January 2021, this pattern is theoretically sound, but seems to have ongoing performance or correctness issues in the compiler. Specialization combined with recursive trait bounds will occassionally cause the compiler to stack overflow  — see my <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80700">Github issue</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="dynamically-kinded-type-level-programming">Dynamically-kinded type-level programming</h2>

<p>To add support for higher-order type functions, I had to remove support for type annotations (actually kind annotations) from Tyrade. Previously, you could write functions like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>tyrade!</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>TIsZero</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>:</span> <span>TNum</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>TBool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>N</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>Z</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TTrue</span><span>,</span>
      <span>S</span><span>(</span><span>N1</span> <span>@</span> <span>TNum</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>TFalse</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program would compile into the trait definition:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>ComputeTIsZero</span><span>:</span> <span>TNum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>:</span> <span>TBool</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This ensures, for example, that a function’s return value matches its return kind. If you wrote a function with a mismatch:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>tyrade!</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>TIsZero</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>:</span> <span>TNum</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>TBool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Z</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the compiler raises an error at the point of <em>definition</em> for <code>TIsZero</code> rather than the point of <em>use</em>. Hence, this language is statically-kinded. However, to kind-check a higher-order function like <code>Map</code>, we need a polymorphic kind system. Ideally, we could write in Tyrade:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>tyrade!</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>L</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t believe it’s possible to encode this concept into Rust’s trait system. So to add higher-order functions, our type-level programming language had to become dynamically-kinded. A sad trade-off, but perhaps more acceptable for type-level programming than value-level. Although errors are caught by the users and not the definers, at least they’re still caught at compile-time!</p>

    <h2>1. Tradition!</h2>
    <p>Euclid may have been the first to define primality in his Elements approximately 300 BC. His goal was to characterize the <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html#theorems">even perfect numbers</a> (numbers like 6 and 28 which are equal to the sum of their aliquot divisors: 6 = 1+2+3, 28=1+2+4+7+14). He realized that the even perfect numbers (<a href="https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html#unknown">no odd perfect numbers are known</a>) are all closely related to the primes of the form 2ᴾ-1 for some prime p (now called Mersennes). So the quest for these jewels began near 300 BC.</p>
  
    <p><a href="https://primes.utm.edu/largest.html">Large primes</a> (especially of this form) were then studied (in chronological order) by Cataldi, Descartes, Fermat, Mersenne, Frenicle, Leibniz, Euler, Landry, Lucas, Catalan, Sylvester, Cunningham, Pepin, Putnam and Lehmer (to name a few). How can we resist joining such an illustrious group?</p>
  
    <p>Much of elementary number theory was developed while deciding how to handle large numbers, how to characterize their factors and discover those which are prime. (Look, for example, at the concepts required to develop simple proofs such as <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/MerDiv.html">[1]</a> or <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/MerDiv2.html">[2]</a>.) In short, the tradition of seeking large primes (especially the Mersennes) has been long and fruitful It is a tradition well worth continuing.</p>
  
    <h2>2. For the by-products of the quest.</h2>
    <p>Being the first to put a man on the moon had great political value for the United States of America, but what was perhaps of the most lasting value to the society was the by-products of the race. By-products such as the new technologies and materials that were developed for the race that are now common everyday items, and the improvements to education's infrastructure that led many man and women into productive lives as scientists and engineers.</p>
  
    <p>The same is true for the quest for record primes. In the tradition section above I listed some of the giants who were in the search (such as Euclid, Euler and Fermat). They left in their wake some of the greatest theorems of elementary number theory (such as <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/FermatsLittleTheorem.html">Fermat's little theorem</a> and quadratic reciprocity). </p>
  
    <p>More recently, the search has demanded new and faster ways of multiplying large integers. In 1968 Strassen discovered how to multiply quickly using Fast Fourier Transforms. He and Schönhage refined and published the method in 1971. GIMPS now uses an improved version of their algorithm developed by the long time Mersenne searcher Richard Crandall [see <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/references/refs.cgi/CF94">CF94</a>].</p>
  
    <p>The Mersenne search is also used by school teachers to involve their students in mathematical research, and perhaps to excite them into careers in science or engineering. And these are just a few of the by-products of the search.</p>
  
    <h2>3. People collect rare and beautiful items.</h2>
    <p>Mersenne primes, which are usually the largest known primes, are both rare and beautiful. Since Euclid initiated the search for and study of Mersennes approximately 300 BC, very few have been found. Less than fifty in all of human history—that is rare!</p>
  
    <p>But they are also beautiful. Mathematics, like all fields of study, has a definite notion of beauty. What qualities are perceived as beautiful in mathematics? We look for proofs that are short, concise, clear, and if possible that combine previous disparate concepts or teach you something new. Mersennes have one of the simplest possible forms for primes, 2<sup>n</sup>-1. The proof of their primality has an elegant simplicity. Mersennes are beautiful and have some surprising applications.</p>
  
    <h2>4. For the glory!</h2>
    <p>Why do athletes try to run faster than anyone else, jump higher, throw a javelin further? Is it because they use the skills of javelin throwing in their jobs? Not likely. More probably it is the desire to compete (and to win!). This desire to compete is not always directed against other humans. Rock climbers may see a cliff as a challenge. Mountain climbers can not resist certain mountains.</p>
  
    <p>Look at the incredible size of these giant primes! Those who found them are like the athletes in that they outran their competition. They are like the mountain climbers in that they have scaled to new heights. Their greatest contribution to mankind is not merely pragmatic, it is to the curiosity and spirit of man. If we lose the desire to do better, will we still be complete?</p>
  
    <h2>5. To test the hardware.</h2>
    <p>Since the dawn of electronic computing, programs for finding primes have been used as a test of the hardware. For example, software routines from the GIMPS project were used by Intel to test Pentium II and Pentium Pro chips before they were shipped. So a great many of the readers of this page have directly benefited from the search for Mersennes.</p>
  
    <p>Slowinski, who has help find more Mersennes than any other, works for Cray Research and they use his program as a hardware test. The infamous Pentium bug was found in a related effort as Thomas Nicely was calculating the <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=TwinPrimeConstant">twin prime constant</a>.</p>
  
    <p>Why are prime programs used this way? They are intensely CPU and bus bound. They are relatively short, give an easily checked answer (when run on a known prime they should output true after their billions of calculations). They can easily be run in the background while other "more important" tasks run, and they are usually easy to stop and restart.</p>
  
    <h2>6. To learn more about their distribution.</h2>
    <p>Though mathematics is not an experimental science, we often look for examples to test conjectures (which we hope to then prove). As the number of examples increase, so does (in a sense) our understanding of the distribution. The <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=PrimeNumberThm">prime number theorem</a> was discovered by looking at tables of primes.</p>
  
    <p>Simple calculations have found patterns, such as the prime number races, which have led to significant amounts of research.</p>
  
    <h2>7. For the money?</h2>
    <p>There are a few who seek primes just for the money. There are prizes for the first prover ten-million digit prime ($100000), the first hundred-million digit prime ($150000), and the first billion digit prime ($250000). [Update: <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/legal/#awards">awards</a>]</p>
   
    <pre>---</pre>
    
    
  
    <p>I could give you technical reasons for crunching for GIMPS, but I won't. Most people aren't interested in them, though they exist and are quite persuasive. I find the psychological reasons far more compelling because, in the end, these are the reasons you will stay with the project.</p>
  
    
    
    <h2>Tell me something I don't know.</h2>
    <p>There is something very gratifying about knowing the actual outcome of your work unit. A GIMPS client returns very definite results. If you trial factor an exponent successfully, it will not only tell you so but give you the factor that it found. If you Lucas-Lehmer test an exponent, you will know that it is, or isn't, prime because it actually tells you.</p>
  
    <h2>Results are forever.</h2>
    <p>You can always refer back to them at any time. Twenty years down the road you will be able to state with certainty that you proved that such-and-such a Mersenne number was composite. This is not the case of most other distributed computing projects. You will never have a screen that pops up and tells you that you just found E. T. You will endlessly process work unit after work unit and never will you be able to distinguish between the first one and the ten-thousandth.</p>
  
    <h2>Anthropomorphic personification.</h2>
    <p>Crunching for distributed computing projects can be thrilling. Watching the number of work units you put out per day can make you excited about your throughput. The work pours in quickly and the results leave even faster.</p>
  
    <p>GIMPS is a different sort of project for it is slow and deliberate. The work units are so unlike most others projects' that we don't even call them work units at all. We call them exponents or assignments because the term 'work unit' isn't personal enough. With today's computers these exponents can take anywhere between two days to two months to complete. Running a Lucas-Lehmer test on a 33M (a Lucas-Lehmer exponent that is in the thirty-three million range or, when expanded, is a ten million digit number) is an intimate process. You will probably have to trial factor it. Then it passes into P-1 factoring stage 1, on to P-1 factoring stage 2, and finally it spends weeks on the Lucas-Lehmer testing.</p>
  
    <p>All the while you watch it slowly mature. The exponent ceases to be a mathematical representation of an integer but instead takes on a life all its own. It is a life that you and your computer nourish with CPU cycles. Even though you know that only a tiny fraction of the Lucas-Lehmer test could possibly have been performed, you check on it several times a day just in case something goes wrong. You get to know it like a friend. You can recite it by number and you remember it long after the result of the test has been sent in to Prime Net.</p>
    <p>No other distributed computing project comes close to this level of emotional attachment for the cruncher. The time invested on each exponent is what makes GIMPS special. It teaches the user patience and perseverance. Devotion and loyalty soon follow.</p>
  
    <h2>It's quiet… too quiet.</h2>
    <p>Another unique aspect of GIMPS is that you can use the client program to search for prime numbers completely on your own. You do not have to go through the server to get your assignments, nor do you have to use the manual web pages.</p>
    
    <p>You can, at any time, test any exponent that you wish. The results will be reported to you in the normal fashion, at which point you simply test another one at your leisure. This allows you to do your own search, testing your own range of exponents, building up your own data sheet of results with no one else the wiser. You can be like the mathematicians of old, working in solitude, hoping to find that one number that will put them in the history books. Should you find a one, you will be accredited, along with the project programmer who after all did write the application.</p>
  
    <h2>Alas, Horatio, I knew him well.</h2>
    <p>The greatness of a distributed computing project isn't dependant on the kind of work it researches, but rather …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2><strong>Part 3: <code>dyn Method</code></strong></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the third and final installment of our series on how we implemented a runtime reflection system in Rust.</p>
<p>So far, we've shown how we came up with a fairly simple <code>Class</code> and <code>Instance</code> model for thinking about runtime Rust classes. In <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">Part 1</a>, we used these for type checking, and in <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2">Part 2</a> we added support for reading attributes off of a struct.</p>
<p>In this post, we pick up where we left off with attribute getters, and expand into <strong>method calls</strong>. In some ways, the same techniques we used for attributes work just as well here. We can store a map from method name to functions implementing them. However, there's a curveball: the Rust <code>Fn*</code> traits. We'll talk through the wrong turns we took, and the tidbits of Rust knowledge we picked up along the way.</p>
<h2>Method Calls</h2>
<p>Now that we have classes, instances, and attributes, the next obvious step is to add methods.</p>
<p>In oso policies, it is possible to call both class and instance methods, with and without arguments.</p>
<p>So given the struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Cat;

impl Cat {
    /// A class method (note lack of `self`).
    fn meow() -&gt; String {
       "meowww".to_string()
    }

    /// An instance method.
    fn feed(&amp;self, food: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
        if food == "tuna" { "purr".to_string() } else { Self::meow() }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We should be able to write policy logic:</p>
<pre><code>favourite_food(cat: Cat, food) if cat.feed(food) != Cat.meow();
</code></pre>

<p>Which says that the input <code>food</code> is the cat's favourite food if the result of feeding the cat is not the same as the result of the cat meowing.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Zero arguments</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple implementation for methods that take <em>zero</em> arguments. The approach for implementing zero-argument methods is extremely similar to how we'd implement attribute getters, and we've actually done this already in Part 2:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
    ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    methods: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, InstanceMethod&gt;
}

struct InstanceMethod(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, we need to add a method onto our <code>ClassBuilder</code> struct to allow us to register new methods:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn add_method&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
where
    F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
    R: crate::ToPolar,
{
    self.class.methods.insert(name, InstanceMethod::new(f));
    self
}
</code></pre>

<p>Super easy! End of blog post. See you next time 😎 </p>
<p>But wait, what about methods with multiple arguments?</p>
<h3>Step 2: Multiple Arguments and the <code>Fn*</code> traits</h3>
<p>Let's take what we have above and add in support for multiple arguments.</p>
<pre><code>struct InstanceMethod(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance, Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p>This mostly works for what we need! Polar doesn't care about method arities (how many arguments the method accepts) – it will send over however many arguments it has as a vector. Polar supports both variable number of arguments (varargs) and keyword arguments (kwargs). The latter is only supported for host languages that also have that concept, and Rust does not.</p>
<p>But this isn't the end of the story. The crucial part of the <code>AttributeGetter</code> interface was that you could pass in any method or closure for the attribute getter, and the <code>AttributeGetter::new</code> method handled all the type-conversions transparently. This hid the messy, error-prone details from the user and kept the interface clean.</p>
<p>So let's do the same for <code>InstanceMethod</code>!</p>
<pre><code>impl InstanceMethod {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, ???&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T, ???)
        F::Result: ToPolarResult,
        T: 'static,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(
            move |receiver: &amp;Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;| {
                let receiver = receiver
                    .downcast()
                    .map_err(|e| e.invariant().into());
                // ermm.... what next?
            },
        ))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We've hit our first problem.</p>
<p>The input to an attribute getter never accepted any arguments, and we only needed it to work for all <code>Fn(&amp;T)</code>. In order to support <em>multiple arguments</em>, we now need to cover <code>Fn(&amp;T)</code>, <code>Fn(&amp;T, A)</code>, <code>Fn(&amp;T, A, B)</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>The first problem is how to convert <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, etc. into <code>PolarValue</code>s.</p>
<p>The second problem is that these are all <em>completely distinct traits</em>. There is no trait capturing "functions of arity 2, 3, 4...". –&nbsp;at least not until the feature is available in stable Rust. In the future, this <em>might</em> be represented with the syntax <code>Fn&lt;Args, Output=T&gt;</code>, but right now using this syntax results in:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0658]: the precise format of `Fn`-family traits' type parameters is subject to change
 --&gt; src/main.rs:2:14
  |
2 |     where F: Fn&lt;(u32,), Output=u32&gt; {
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: use parenthetical notation instead: `Fn(u32) -&gt; u32`
  |
  = note: see issue #29625 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29625&gt; for more information
</code></pre>

<p>We could opt to use Rust nightly to get these features, but it's not a huge stretch to implement them ourselves.</p>
<h3>Implementing our own <code>Method</code> trait</h3>
<p>This is where as the writer it's tempting to unveil my newly-created trait, perfectly matching what we needed, and make it look like I just put fingers to keyboard to get to the definition.</p>
<p>In reality, we spent a sizeable chunk of our engineering effort for this project on this one trait. We made mistakes. We wrote code that we threw out. And a lot of that is because we didn't understand some of the nuances of Rust functions and the trait resolution system. Instead of papering over all of that, we thought it would be more interesting to show you what we tried. </p>
<p><strong>Attempt #1</strong></p>
<p>The first thing we tried was, in hindsight, a little greedy. Why not just skip straight to writing a trait to encapsulate precisely what we need?</p>
<pre><code>pub trait Method {
   fn invoke(&amp;self, receiver: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This looks great, let's try implementing it for one of our <code>Fn</code> variants:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;F, T, R&gt; Method for F
where
   F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
   T: 'static,
   R: ToPolarValue,
{
    fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast::&lt;T&gt;().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Results in:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;F, T, R&gt; Method for F
        ^ unconstrained type parameter
the type parameter `T` is not constrained by the impl trait, self type, or predicates

impl&lt;F, T, R&gt; Method for F
           ^ unconstrained type parameter
the type parameter `R` is not constrained by the impl trait, self type, or predicates
</code></pre>

<p>It's likely that most people have hit some variation of this error in their Rust adventures! What is going on here? <code>T</code> and <code>R</code> <em>look</em> pretty constrained to me? They are right there inside the definition of <code>F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>Our mistake was reading those trait bounds as: <code>F</code> is a function from <code>&amp;T</code> to <code>R</code>, whereas in reality this is a regular old trait bound with slightly different syntax for the trait itself. And one function might implement multiple of these trait bounds.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<pre><code>// do nothing
fn ident&lt;T&gt;(t: T) -&gt; T { t }

let _ = &amp;ident as &amp;dyn Fn(u32) -&gt; u32;
let _ = &amp;ident as &amp;dyn Fn(String) -&gt; String;
</code></pre>

<p>So which trait should we use for the implementation of <code>Method</code> for <code>ident</code>?</p>
<p>Here's another way of looking at this problem. Suppose instead we decided to exhaustively implement our <code>Method</code> trait for all types we care about:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;F&gt; Method for F
where
   F: Fn(&amp;u32) -&gt; u32,
{
    fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast::&lt;u32&gt;().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}

impl&lt;F&gt; Method for F
where
   F: Fn(&amp;String) -&gt; String,
{
    fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast::&lt;String&gt;().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ignoring for now just how bad an idea this is, it doesn't even work! We get:</p>
<pre><code>conflicting implementations of trait `Method`:
</code></pre>

<p>Look back to <code>ident</code>. That one function implements both <code>Fn(String) -&gt; String</code> and <code>Fn(u32) -&gt; u32</code> traits. Similarly, in the above case, a function that implements both <code>Fn(&amp;String) -&gt; String</code> and <code>Fn(&amp;u32) -&gt; u32</code> would have two possible implementations for <code>Method</code>. So we get conflicting implementations.  </p>
<p><em>Actually</em>, it goes even further than that. Implementing a blanket trait implementation over <em>any</em> two function trait bounds results in conflicting implementations. Even though such a function couldn't exist:</p>
<pre><code>trait Test {}

impl&lt;F: Fn()&gt; Test for F { }
impl&lt;F: Fn(String) -&gt; String&gt; Test for F { }
</code></pre>

<p>Results in:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `Test`:
  |
4 | impl&lt;F: Fn()&gt; Test for F { }
  | ------------------------ first implementation here
5 | impl&lt;F: Fn(String) -&gt; String&gt; Test for F { }
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ conflicting implementation
</code></pre>

<p>One day (or today, if you're on Rust nightly), Rust might let you implement <code>Fn</code> for your own types, support variadic functions (what do you mean Rust already supports <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html#variadic-functions">variadic functions</a>?), and do all kinds of fun things of the sort. But for now we're not going to get much farther with this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Attempt #2</strong></p>
<p>This <code>Method</code> trait looks too convenient to throw away entirely at the first sign of complication. Let's try something different. If our original mistake was thinking of <code>Fn</code> as a function instead of a trait, perhaps we can heed the wisdom of the Rust docs and use <code>fn</code> instead.</p>
<p><img alt="Building%20a%20runtime%20reflection%20system%20for%20Rust%20(Par%20e9d46e4c771847e7ba119df92cf2a8b9/Untitled.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/runtime-reflection-pt-3/Building%20a%20runtime%20reflection%20system%20for%20Rust%20%28Par%20e9d46e4c771847e7ba119df92cf2a8b9/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Based on the docs, we can use <code>fn</code> with both regular functions and closures! Great, let's do just that:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T, R&gt; Method for fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R
where
    T: 'static,
    R: ToPolarValue,
{
     fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Works fine! Let's try it out:</p>
<pre><code>let clone = |receiver: &amp;String| -&gt; String { receiver.clone() };
let clone_method: Box&lt;dyn Method&gt; = Box::new(clone);
let …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<div><p>Out of the 5 Raspberry Pi Zeros I own only one would boot with the Arm freq set to 1.5Ghz I chose this board as it stood the best chance. </p><p>I affixed the board to the cold side of the Peltier plate and started at 1200Mhz increasing by 50Mhz at a time until I reached 1500Mhz where the Pi Zero became unstable once again, I then decided to go back by 50Mhz at a time until I found a stable clock speed. </p></div>



<div><p>Each change was fully tested using stress-ng with the number of threads set to 3 for 10 minutes. </p><p>The final Overclocking settings that proved stable are as follows: </p></div>

<p>As can be seen above the Pi Zero was running at 1.5Ghz and it was even stable enough to benchmark. </p>







<h2>Benchmarks</h2>



<p>I decided to run UnixBench as usual as its what I had to hand and its the benchmark tool used to gather the benchmarks across all of my SBC’s</p>

<div><p>The Raspberry Pi Zero at the stock 1GHz Arm Freq produced a result of 70, with the rather extreme overclock it benchmarked at 117! Thats a 67% increase in performance! </p><p>Whist this is a near pointless activity it was fun to push a Raspberry Pi Zero to its limits and this is likely the cheapest way to get into extreme overclocking. The Pi and the Peltier cooler ran for just under 4 hours whilst I did this testing and wrote this post. Here is a final photo taken just before this was published showing the frost build up.  </p></div>

Call 1-800-IDGAMES and unlock the full version of Quake for only $45.00.
</p><p>
The tool was called <a href="https://archive.org/details/qcrack.exe">QCRACK.EXE</a>, and it was released by Agony from the GNOMON cracking group.&nbsp; Here is the first screen (including the usage instructions):</p><p>
And here is QCRACK.EXE generating a serial number for the challenge string in the first image:</p><p>
But the story did not end there: the CD-ROM also included encrypted versions of every first-person shooter previously released by id Software:</p><p>
Just click on the photo of your choice and get more info on how to order and unlock your favorite idware!
</p><p>
And since this was based on a commercial software protection solution called TestDrive (See:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US5341429">Transformation of ephemeral material</a>) it was even possible that software from other vendors could also be unlocked. Pretty impressive.</p><p>
I decided to reverse engineer QCRACK.EXE to unveil its secrets.&nbsp; I spend a couple of weekends working on it back in August 2016, but I eventually got stalled and lost interest.&nbsp; Then, a few weeks ago (in January 2018), I restarted working on it and was finally able to understand the general idea:</p><p>
I quickly noticed that a lot of work could be avoided if I were able to dump from memory the values of NEW for each code name.&nbsp; Here is an updated flowchart remarking the essential parts of the process:</p><p>
I tried a few debuggers but they didn't support the format (either they didn't support COFF or they got confused by the DPMI).&nbsp; I guess some old debugger should work but I decided it was easier to write a basic memory dumper...</p><p>
I first tried to modify the arguments to the printf() calls and it kinda worked.&nbsp; But then, at some point, I hex-edited the binary to add an INT 3 opcode (0xCC) in order to generate a SIGTRAP and I noticed it printed a useful backtrace.</p><p>
I decided I could abuse that output to leak the memory values I wanted by moving the values into the registers before triggering the SIGTRAP.&nbsp; Here is my code to retrieve 24 bytes from an arbitrary address using the EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI and EDI registers:</p><p>
Here is the output for the code name &nbsp;“quake2” (which is the correct codename for the game Quake, it is not related to the game Quake 2, which didn't exist back then):</p><p>
I repeated the process for each game and I was finally able to write a working keygen:</p><div>

<span face="verdana" color="#ffff00">Overview:</span><br>
I know what you're thinking to yourself.... What is there to know about a flashlight, switch it on and it lights up, switch it off and the light goes out. That's true for the most basic flashlights. When looking for a new flashlight, I discovered that there is a huge community of people that are interested in (or obsessed with) flashlights. They typically refer to themselves as 'flashaholics'. Initially, it was difficult to understand some of the discussions on the various forums because there were so many new terms. This page is a primer. After you understand the basics you'll better understand the discussions on the various flashlight forums (like the Candlepower forum).

Note:<br>
There will be products that I recommend on this page. I receive no compensation for this. These are simply products that I have used and would recommend to my friends.

<p>
Until recently, virtually all flashlights were simple on/off devices (like the one below) with very limited output. Flashlights like the 4D-cell Maglite were considered to be some of the best, in terms of light output. Those flashlights used an incandescent lamp (hot wire filament producing light). Except for the cheapest flashlights, incandescent lamps are being phased out. The newer flashlights using LEDs produce much more light than most of the flashlights using incandescent lamps. Most people have never seen a flashlight that has anything other than a simple on/off switch. The newer LED flashlights have many modes and various output levels. This makes them much more versatile. If the only options for a flashlight are off and full-on and the flashlight produces an intense output, it makes it almost useless for close-up use (reading a map while someone is driving, etc...) because it's simply too bright. With multiple output levels, the light becomes much more versatile. The various output modes will be described in more detail later.

<p>
A quick note... Most people think it's normal to have to beat on a flashlight to make it work. We do it without thinking. It's almost as if it's coded into our DNA. Having to beat on a flashlight is normal for older, budget lights but not for high quality lights. High quality lights switch on flawlessly EVERY time.

<p>
There are dozens of popular manufacturers of high performance flashlights. Names like 4Sevens, Fenix (pronounced like Phoenix), Nitecore, Surefire, Streamlight are considered some of the best. Most of these lights remain on the cutting edge and, at any point in time, produce lights that produce the most intense output possible. Maglite (a familiar example below) is another very common brand but they're not typically considered to be at the cutting edge of technology (although the new XL100 may be an exception). That doesn't mean that they're not good quality  lights but if you're looking for bragging rights (brightest light, smallest size...), Maglite isn't generally in the running. However, if you want a light that's going to be reliable and will last nearly forever, Maglite is still a very good choice.

<p>

When you initially get into flashlight collecting, you may be shocked by the prices. Many people are used to buying a two D-cell Rayovac flashlight for $2 at Wal-Mart (really, $2.00, batteries included). Some spend $30 on a two or three D-cell LED Maglite. For most people, these will do everything they need them to do. If you want higher performance flashlights, you'll have to pay significantly more. For example, there are LED flashlights that operate off of one AA or one CR123A battery that produce significantly more light than a 2D-cell Maglite but you can expect to pay at least twice as much for those tiny, high performance  lights. For example, the Nitecore EX11 below sells for approximately $60. On average, small single cell high performance LED flashlights cost approximately $50. Small high performance two cell flashlights (those that use two AA or 2 CR123A batteries) can cost $100 or more. The second image below (Maelstrom G5) is one example. It's powered by two CR123A cells or one 18650 lithium-ion cell. It sells for $100-150 and is about 6" long.  Custom lights (custom machined housings with high performance emitters and custom reflectors) can cost $500 or more. High performance handheld HID search lights can cost well over $2000.

<p>
Note:<br>
In the two photos above, you can see that there is a chrome bezel on the end of the flashlight. In some instances, this is cosmetic only and serves no special purpose. In other lights, the ring is used to maintain force against the reflector which maintains force against the LED which keeps it tightly against the internal heatsink. If the bezel is loose, the LED may not remain tightly against the heatsink and that could cause it to fail prematurely. If the bezel gets so loose that it falls off of the light, the lens and reflector may fall out and become lost or damaged. Check the tightness of the bezel on your flashlights. They don't often get loose but if they do, it could lead to the flashlight becoming unusable and un-repairable because not all parts are available for all lights.

<p>
<span face="verdana" color="#ffff00">Incandescent Lamps:</span><br>
Incandescent lamps have been around since the 1800s. They are nothing more than a <a href="http://www.asos1.com/flashlight/IMG_0589b.jpg" onclick="window.open('IMG_0589b.jpg', 'newWindow', 'toolbar=no, directories=no, location=no, status=yes, menubar=no, resizable=no, scrollbars=no, width=820, height=587'); return false">wire</a> that's heated (by driving current through it) until it glows. It's simple and has served us well. It's not, however, very efficient. High power lamps produce a lot of heat and use a lot of energy. Incandescent lamps are also fragile. This isn't a big problem with most stationary lights (in the home, installed into a table lamp or in a light fixture) but in a flashlight, it can be a significant problem. Dropping a flashlight often causes the filament to break (especially if it's lit when dropped). If you're in a situation where you rely on the light for your safety and it uses an incandescent lamp, it's important that you carry a spare lamp. Many of the Maglite flashlights have a spare lamp in the tailcap. Most others don't.   

</p><center><img src="http://www.asos1.com/flashlight/IMG_4510b.jpg" alt=""></center>


<p>
Incandescent lamps have a filament in the glass envelope. The wire that makes up the filament is generally tungsten. In the most common incandescent lamps the glass envelope has the air evacuated, leaving a vacuum. This prevents the tungsten filament from burning (as it would if oxygen were present). This is why an incandescent light bulb instantly burns out when the glass envelope is broken. Other types of incandescent lamps are filled with an inert gas (vs having a vacuum - no gas). Halogen lamps will typically be filled with argon, krypton or xenon gas. Halogen lamps are typically brighter than standard incandescents for a given wattage. That's why many people replace standard lamps with xenon or krypton lamps. 

</p><p>
The image below is an incandescent lamp with the filament lit. As you can imagine, the wire is VERY hot. When the filament is hot, the tungsten is constantly evaporating. In time, the wire becomes thinner and thinner until it opens (burns out). 

</p><center><img src="http://www.asos1.com/flashlight/IMG_0866b.jpg" width="800" height="580" alt=""></center>


<p>
<span face="verdana" color="#ffff00">LED Emitters:</span><br>
Most of the newer, more advanced flashlights use LED (Light Emitting Diode) emitters in place of incandescent lamps. They're typically much more efficient (more light output for a given amount of energy used) and last a very long time. They're generally rated for 50,000 hours or more when operated according to the manufacturer's specifications (i.e., not over-driven to produce more output). LEDs are also much more durable. Dropping them generally causes no damage to the emitter. There were a few early LED flashlights that were easily damaged if dropped but that's no longer an issue.  The LED emitter below is shown at approximately 50x the actual height/width (depending on your monitor and the display resolution). The actual device is 3.45mm wide. 

</p><center><img src="http://www.asos1.com/flashlight/IMG_0593b.jpg" width="800" height="807" alt=""></center>

<p>
In general, common flashlights don't heat up when used. It's surprising to some that high performance LED flashlights heat up when used at or near the highest output level. The ridges or cooling fins around the head of a flashlight aren't cosmetic, they are there to promote cooling. The ridges increase the surface area of the head and therefore make it easier to dissipate the heat produced by the LED. Without the ridges, the light would get significantly hotter which would mean that the LED would run hotter which could cause the LED to fail prematurely. 

</p><p>
Power dissipation in the LED causes it to heat up. The LED dissipates heat because there is current flowing through it and there is a voltage drop across it. The voltage drop will generally be between 3.25 and 3.8v and varies depending on the current flowing through it. The voltage drop is the greatest when the LED is being driven the hardest (most current flowing through it). Higher current must flow to make it brighter. If you look at the Ohm's law formula P=I*E (power dissipation equals current flow multiplied by voltage) you can see that increasing either the voltage or the current cause the power dissipation to increase. Since increasing the current flow also forces an increase in the voltage drop, you can see that when you get more output, you produce more heat. This is why the larger flashlights with higher output must have larger heads (which have more surface area). It's also true that, many times, they have larger heads because they have larger reflectors but even if they didn't need larger reflectors, they would still have to have …</p></div></td></div></div>

We create and share our artistic talent with the wider world in order to solve a problem.</p><p>Work therefore should be inherently flexible and allow us to freely move around and explore all creative avenues and problems. But unfortunately in the modern world, we seldom have the opportunity to do such a thing.</p><p>That’s why I think we’re beginning to see an explosion in the rise of entrepreneurialism. Yes, times are hard and we all want a side hustle to pay the bills. But if we look deeper, the core issue at hand is the fact that our 9-5 jobs are rigid and don’t give us the space to explore problems that we find interesting.</p><p>As a society, we’ve optimised human work to a point where a single career can be deemed successful even though the job is doing the same thing all day every day for the rest of time. That right there is insanity.</p><p>Let’s use the hyper specialisation of tech jobs right now. A front end engineer should only care on the front end of the product. They should spend their time researching the new JS frameworks, UI principles, and upcoming web standards. However, a front end engineer should not be running analysis on user behaviour, building out new API routes, or talking and selling to customers.</p><p>At companies of significant scale if a front end engineer was to step outside their designated role he or she would be told to focus on their current tasks of the sprint and leave that exploratory work to marketing or UX.</p><p>That’s where I believe bigger companies have gone wrong. Yes, people are inherently better at doing one thing. But, they should never just do that one thing 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.</p><p>Small companies, however, have the right formula. You see, at a small company you’ll often end up wearing numerous hats. Designers will code, engineers will do support, CEOs will be project managers etc. Due to a lack of resources, you open up the possibility for people to try new things and often that’s where innovation lies. Startups and small companies end up creating new job roles such as Growth Hacking or Growth engineering for two job categories that otherwise wouldn’t have been combined without that kind of flexibility.</p></article></div></div>]]>

<p>For many FPS players Dust - and the later Dust 2 - are the quintessential Counter-Strike maps. They’ve been featured in nearly every major Counter-Strike tournament, and been responsible for countless millions virtual deaths, bomb detonations and defusals. But these maps actually owe their existence to Team Fortress 2 - a game that was released eight years <em>after</em> Dust became a staple of the Counter-Strike map rotation.</p>

<h2 id="time-travelling">Time Travelling</h2>

<p>It started in the summer of 1999, Suffolk, England. I was 16 years old, recuperating from end-of-year exams and enjoying my newfound freedom from school work. Half-Life was only a few months old, yet was scooping up more ‘Game of the Year’ awards than there were game magazines, leaving gamers desperate to know what Valve Software were going to make next.</p>

<p>Thankfully, news broke that Valve had hired the team behind ‘Team Fortress’, a free mod for Quake that added class-based team multiplayer to the game. Like any responsible teenager, I’d spent more hours sat staring into a screen zooming around dodging rockets, slinging grenades and capturing the flag than I had with my head stuck in schoolwork, much to the chagrin of my parents. Their next project? A sequel, excitingly titled ‘Team Fortress 2’.</p>

<p>It seemed that whilst I had been busy ambushing my future educational prospects, behind closed doors Valve had been hammering away at updating and upgrading Team Fortress for a new generation of hardware. News of Team Fortress 2 was rare and sporadic, but occasionally a tidbit here or a screenshot there would nervously peer out to an excited but nervous audience of TF fans.</p>

<p>Before too long, a <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Promotional_images">handful of screenshots</a> started their steady journey around the gaming websites of the late nineties. Two particular screenshots leapt out at me:</p>

<figure>
	<div><p><span><a href="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/i/design/making-dust/tf2_01.jpg"><img src="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/i/design/making-dust/tf2_01_thumb.jpg" alt="Team Fortress 2"></a></span></p>

</div>
	<figcaption>Two early screenshots of Team Fortress 2.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The seed had been sown.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new Half-Life modification known as ‘Counter-Strike’ had been picking up a steady stream of players. In the autumn of 1999, Minh ‘gooseman’ Le and Jess Cliffe released its second beta - and it supplanted Team Fortress to become my new addiction. It came with a texture pack of urban textures (‘cstrike.wad’) that, upon discovery, I set about making a map with - this became ‘<a href="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/blog/a-little-wad-the-story-of-cs_tire/">cs_tire</a>’, a hostage rescue map set in (of all places) a retirement home. Surprisingly, this map was deemed good enough to be included in the third beta release of Counter-Strike, and Jess subsequently asked me if I’d be interested in making a map for the fourth beta. He was very keen to hook me up with their texture artist to help me make something absolutely and completely original.</p>

<p>Jess introduced me to artist Chris ‘MacMan’ Ashton - the same artist behind the urban texture set used in my retirement home map - and we got to work creating a new, totally original Counter-Strike map. Unfortunately it was too late to save me from TF2’s influence and I asked for these instead:</p>

<figure>
	<p><span><img src="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/i/design/making-dust/tf2-textures.jpg" alt="Team Fortress 2 texture selection"></span></p>
	<figcaption>Team Fortress 2 screenshots were used to create a core texture set</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Undeterred by my complete lack of originality, Chris quickly got back to me with beautiful lookalikes. While not exact replicas, I selfishly became completely infatuated with them, just like I had the screenshots they were based on . I quickly bundled them all together into my own texture pack and called it “cs_dest.wad” - shorthand for “Destiny”.</p>

<p>With these TF2-alike textures I could finally make a map and pretend I was playing Team Fortress 2, but something was wrong. I felt guilt - TF2 wasn’t even out yet and I was already trying to sap all the effort Valve had been putting into it. It was akin to snatching a duckling from under its mothers beak. “But surely”, I thought, “Valve wouldn’t mind one me making one small map for one small mod for their one and only published game? A map that maybe only a handful of people would ever play?”</p>

<p>I marched on.</p>

<h2 id="copy-and-paste">Copy and Paste</h2>

<p>Starting the map was the easy bit - the first area boasted a long road flanked by buildings, leading to an archway and a wall dividing it in two, just like I’d seen in the screenshots. I decorated every building and wall with ornate trims along the top or bottom, again aping TF2, as I tried my hardest to evoke the same sense of place, desolation, and scale. These features would go on to define the underlying architectural style of Dust.</p>

<p>My effort wasn’t <em>quite</em> identical to the map featured in those coveted TF2 screenshots, but it was close enough, and - somewhat more importantly - it was a start.</p>

<p>The arched doorways became a hallmark of the Dust theme - a Dust map is simply not Dust without at least two or three arches dividing the map into distinct zones. Creating the first one was at the time a great test of my technical mapping ability, and I struggled for a little while before landing on a technique that worked. My design eschewed the Reuleaux triangle shape of the TF2 arches for a simpler semi-circle, partly because it was simpler, but primarily to ease player passage through them. I extruded the arches from their adjoining wall - lifted straight from the screenshots.</p>

</div>
	<figcaption>The first  incarnation of what became the CT spawn</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I considered against copying the screenshots verbatim for fear of upsetting Valve, and so started guessing how the rest of the area should look. I’d already created a raised platform, and had decided that this could be the area that the Counter-Terrorist team would spawn in at the start of the match. This necessitated defensive measures to protect their spawn area, so I made some windows:</p>

<figure>
	<div><p><span><a href="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/i/design/making-dust/early_windows_01.jpg"><img src="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/i/design/making-dust/early_windows_01_thumb.jpg" alt="Early CT spawn area"></a></span></p>

</div>
	<figcaption>The view from inside a building next to the CT spawn</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Not only did they look hideous, but the windows didn’t give the defensively-advantageous views I wanted the CT team to have. Nor did they fit with the intended gameplay. I didn’t want to encourage the CTs to hold back, and removed them - although in all honestly, at this point I really didn’t know where the map was going.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-influence">Under the Influence</h2>

<p>Side-by-side, the TF2 ‘influence’ is plain to see:</p>

<figure>

</div>

</div>
	<figcaption>TF directly influenced building placement and the design of the arches.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>In many respects, the TF2 screenshot looks nicer to me - smoother and softer than the harsh edges of the Dust buildings. I was far more comfortable working with standard geometric shapes, 90 degree corners and 45 degree angles, which is why Dust looks far boxier in comparison to the TF2 screenshot it was based on.</p>

<p>That was the easy part done - after all, Valve had already created this much of the map for me and all I’d had to do was copy it. But what I had wasn’t much - it was barely enough for a one-on-one deathmatch, let alone two teams of eight players gunning it out. Worse still, there were no more screenshots to use for ‘inspiration’ - I had to make the rest of the map off my own back and imagination.</p>



<p>Having nailed down the design of the first area, producing the rest of the map was merely a case of extrapolating it into a complete, playable environment. However this was much easier said than done - the next section of the map proved rather more challenging.</p>

<p>I had created a T-junction out of the CT spawn, but struggled to know what to do with it. My past mapping experience was mostly creating tight interiors rather than not vast exteriors, and so I was feeling very lost. Desperate, I shoe-horned a bend in the road leading to a downward slope, and at the end of it - an underground cavern.</p>

<figure>
	<div><p><span><a href="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/i/design/making-dust/underground_01.jpg"><img src="https://www.johnsto.co.uk/i/design/making-dust/underground_01_thumb.jpg" alt="An underground chamber"></a></span></p>

</div>
	<figcaption>The underpass originally descended into a vast underground facility, but this was scrapped the moment I played it.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>It didn’t work, of course. While the CT spawn area was light and airy, this giant room was gloomy, boxy and felt dead compared to the sunny exterior I’d already made. Observing it also lacked any gameplay potential, I swiftly deleted it. Dust would be an outdoor map.</p>

<p>I was still stuck. It’s at times like these where working without an initial design can prove extremely difficult. You look at what you’ve got, and struggle to see where to take it, knowing that a step in one direction is a step away from a solution in another direction - and you don’t know which will turn out better. It can be very tough and incredibly tempting to just scrap  <em>everything</em> and start again. I’d made all my previous maps one room at a time, making it up as I go along with precious little pre-planning, and they had gone reasonably well. I had to hope I could do the same again.</p>

<p>Mercifully, that’s exactly what happened.</p>

<figure>

</div>
	<figcaption>The Terrorist spawn area, and shallow decline into the underpass.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Within just a few hours - and seemingly out of nowhere - the Terrorist spawn area was complete. I was far happier with this side of the map, perhaps a product of becoming comfortable with the visual and architectural style. The shallow decline into the underpass is perhaps one of my favourite aspects, both aesthetically and as a player who spent many hours armed with a Steyr Scout at the crest popping off opponents’ heads.</p>

<p>At one point I planned an alleyway from the Terrorist side of the underpass that fed around to the CT ‘sniper nest’, but this path seemed like it would be too long, too linear, and simply too <em>dull</em>. I just blocked it up with crates instead, still visible in the original version of the map (and the screenshot above.)</p>

<p>Dust’s central hallway was pivotal in tying all these pieces together. Unfortunately, I can recollect very little about its creation, bar my explicit efforts to ensure players couldn’t see all the way through it from one end to the other. Every crate found in the intersection was strategically positioned to cut off lines-of-sight and improve performance. It was in this corridor that each team would typically meet, and so it needed to be fair, and balanced, with a slight defensive bias.</p>

          <p><b>Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> for the final result!</b></p>

          <p>QR codes provide a clear and approachable way of translating the physical world to the
          digital world. When I see a QR code, I always want to scan it to find out what is behind
          it, somehow they always fascinate me. But QR codes always look very similar, could there
          be a way to make them look more cool? Make them a certain specific shape or contain pixel
          art?</p>

          <p>People already (ab)use the error correction build into QR codes to embed their logo
          in it, they simply put their logo over a part of the QR code and let the error correction
          handle the missing data. However, you can never obscure more than 30% of the code (and
          usually a lot less) if you choose this approach. But QR codes are mostly a visualisation
          of data. Can we approach the problem from the other side? What if we don't try to
          design a QR code to fit the data, but fit the data to the design of the QR code that we
          want.</p>

          <p>Spoiler, we can. Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a>. All the code is
          totally free and open source, so feel free to
          contribute <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art">on GitHub</a></p>

          <h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

          <p>Say, we want to promote our website. And we have a nice grayscale logo. Now we want to
          have an engaging QR code that looks like our logo.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-logo.svg" alt="My-QR.art logo"></p><p>And we have an URL that we want the QR code to lead us too, for
            example: <a href="https://my-qr.art/">https://my-qr.art</a>.</p>
          
          <p>We set up a web server that can redirect certain URLs to other URLs. Then we can make
          the beginning of the data of our QR code the URL to that web-server and the rest of the
          QR's data can be anything. So we can choose the rest of the data in any way that makes
          our QR code look most like our design!</p>

          <p>For example the QR code could send you
            to <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>. On the back-end we tell
            the server to redirect any request with the
            URL <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>
            to <code>https://my-qr.art</code>. And tada! We have a functional QR code that sends us to
            the address we want, while having way more control over how the QR code looks! Up to 80%
            of the code can be freely designed this way!</p>

          <p>When we have this all working, we could even make nice scannable QR gifs. We could make
          each frame separately and let them all redirect to the same page. I admit, most QR codes
          are printed, so gifs might not make the most sense, but they look pretty cool! To keep you
          excited for the rest of the article, here is world's first ever working QR gif (as far
          as I know)!</p>

          <h2 id="qr-codes">How does QR work?</h2>

          <p>Now that we know the concept, lets get started. First we need to know how QR codes
          actually work.</p>

          <p>QR codes encode data by making some blocks dark and other light. The QR scanner can
          then read which are dark and which are light and reconstruct the original data. QR codes
          can have 40 different sizes, from <em>version 1</em> (very small, 17x17) to <em>version
          40</em> (very big, 177x177). QR codes are made of black and white 'modules' and
          each module has one of the following 4 functions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Help the scanner recognise and orient the QR code</li>
            <li>Give information about the QR code size, type and other internal QR stuff</li>
            <li>Encode the actual data that the QR code represents</li>
            <li>Encode error correction info about the QR code</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="drawing">Creating a template</h2>

          <p>Our plan is to allow the user to choose the colour of any module that has function 3. So
          the first step is to let the user know which pixels they can control and which pixels they
          can't control for the QR code size they chose. For now lets try to create an image on
          which the modules with function 3 are coloured white and all other modules are coloured
          grey.</p>

          <p>For this we can colour all the modules and error data. To get this right you really need
          to dive into how QR codes work. We need to think about the data encoding, interleaving,
          extra eyes, error words and more. We'll also need to take into account that we'll
          need to reserve first few characters of our data for the start of our URL. Luckily there
          is a great source on QR codes on the
          internet, <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/introduction">the QR code
          tutorial from Thonky.com</a>. Putting the work in, we get something like this, for version
          30.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-template.png" alt="A template for a QR design"></p><h2 id="reading">Reading a design</h2>

          <p>Now let's work on the other side of the puzzle, when we have a design that a user
          has drawn on our template, how do we convert it to a working QR code? QR codes have 4
          possible types of encoding: <em>numeric</em>, <em>alphanumeric</em>, <em>binary</em>
          and <em>kanji</em>. We need something that we can create valid URLs with, so numeric and
          kanji are out. Secondly, we need the random string at the end of our URL to
          be <em>normal</em> enough so that QR scanners will still recognise our code as an
          URL. The <em>binary</em> encoding will create characters that aren't ordinarily found
          in URLs ('\0' for example), which means lots of QR scanners won't let their
          users open our URL. Luckily the <em>alphanumeric</em> encoding has just enough characters
          to let us make valid URLs (although they'll have to be all caps).</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-design.png" alt="A design for a QR code that contains the My-QR.art logo">

          <img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-data-order.png" title="Made by Thonky, shared under the CC ANC 4.0" alt="An illustration from Thonky.com that shows how data is encoded in a QR code"></p><p>So with that figured out, lets read that design the user made. First we'll extract
          a bit string from all the data modules in the design. For small QR codes this is quite
          straight forward, the QR code is simply read from right to left, bottom to top and back
          again in double columns, see the illustration from Thonky above. However, when the QR code
          size passes 5, we'll have to take into account interleaving. Then the data words are
          scattered around the QR code, presumably to make the data pattern more random. So
          we'll have to reverse that interleaving procedure. Luckily how it works is explained
          by <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-coding">Thonky.com</a>. At
          last we get a bit string from our design, here we only show the first 80 character, the
          real bit string for this design is 13863 bits long.</p>
          <p><code>01100011010101001100101010001100011110111010100000000001110100111110011101001001</code></p>

          <h3 id="decoding">Decoding the bitstring</h3>
          <p>Now we'll need to decode the bits to an alphanumeric string. Here we group 11 bits
          together every time and then convert that into two alphanumeric characters
          using <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/alphanumeric-table">this
          table</a>. We get the following data string (again truncated).</p>

          <p><code>KS$#LKAHRDF9H8XQI9AL HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <p>We'll just replace the first 20 characters with our URL prefix and we get:</p>

          <p><code>HTTPS://MY-QR.ART/R/ HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <h3 id="qr-code">Generating the QR code</h3>

          <p>Now we can use any QR library to create the QR code! The QR library will handle adding
          all the difficult error codes and other boring stuff for us.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/failed-qr.png" alt="A random looking QR code"></p><p>But what is that? Why does it still look all random? The problem is masking. The QR
          code spec includes 5 different masks and the mask that makes the QR code look most random
          is chosen, which is almost certainly not our design. This is done to make the code easier
          to read for scanners. However, in my experience, QR codes scan just fine with more
          structured data. So we don't have to feel too bad about modifying our QR library to
          always use the same mask. Then after we apply the same mask to our design before
          processing it, we finally get the desired image.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-qr.png" alt="A QR code with the design in it"></p><h2 id="redirecting">Redirecting the request</h2>

          <p>Now to redirect the QR code to the right domain. This should be easy, put the QR URL in
          a database and link it to the redirect URL. When we receive a request, simply look up the
          corresponding URL in a database. However, if we want to use a modern web server, we'll
          have to jump through some hoops... Apache doesn't like most of our URLs, since they
          are technically malformed (ugh, spoil the fun much Apache?). So it throws an <em>Error
          400: Bad request</em>. We can't disable this error anywhere it seems. However, luckily
          there is a workaround, we can set a custom error page for our <em>Error 400</em>, so if we
          just set the redirect page as the error page for <em>Error 400</em>, we are home free!
          Luckily Apache is not so much of a spoilsport that it throws a Bad Request error while
          trying to handle a Bad Request...</p>

          <p>For the back-end I've been using Django, and it has another fun bug that shows up
          with these really weird URLs. It tries to decode the URL as an ISO-8859-1 string, but some
          of the characters passed by Apache aren't in ISO-8859-1. So we have to derive our own
          WSGI handler to workaround
          this, <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art/blob/main/my_qr_art/custom_wsgi.py">see
          here</a>. But now it works, try to scan the QR we made, it redirects where we want it to
            redirect!</p>

          <p>One small caveat though, QR codes themselves are standardized and we create standard
          compliant QR codes with correct URLs in them, but QR scanners aren't standardized and some
          might not recognize our code as a URL and will see it as plain text instead.</p>

          <h2 id="a-web-app">Custom QR codes for everyone!</h2>

          <p>Just outputting and parsing images isn't very user friendly, so I made a nice web
          app at <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> using Django. It
          has <a href="https://my-qr.art/editor">a friendly editor</a> where you can draw, fill or
          upload black and white images to make your QR code. It also has some …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>The Internet is currently ablaze with the news that WhatsApp will soon be requiring more user data to be shared with Facebook. This reminded me of another nefarious thing WhatsApp does that I haven’t seen anyone else talking about:</p> <h4 id="whatsapp-uses-dark-patterns-to-coerce-you-into-giving-it-access-to-your-contacts"> <a href="#whatsapp-uses-dark-patterns-to-coerce-you-into-giving-it-access-to-your-contacts"></a> <em>WhatsApp uses dark patterns to coerce you into giving it access to your contacts</em> </h4> <p>While WhatsApp will work without access to your contacts, the user experience is deliberately degraded. Without access to your contacts, WhatsApp prominently displays each participant’s phone number above their message, with their display name shown next to it, almost as an afterthought:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.mattbearman.com/assets/img/blog/whatsapp-contacts/message.png" alt="WhatsApp Message"></p> <p>The name is very low contrast compared to the background, where as the phone number is listed first, in larger text, and a high contrast colour. Your eye is immediately drawn to the phone number, making it hard to see at a glance who’s talking. The display name will also be truncated if it’s too long for the available space.</p> <p>Even worse is the list of chats, which <em>only</em> displays the phone number for non-group chats, no names in sight:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.mattbearman.com/assets/img/blog/whatsapp-contacts/chats.png" alt="WhatsApp Chats"></p> <p>You do at least get the user’s profile picture here, but not everyone adds a profile picture, and even if they do, they may choose one that is not easily recognisable.</p> <p>There’s no good reason for WhatsApp to treat privacy conscious users this way. The name field is <strong>required</strong> when setting up a WhatsApp account, so every user has a name that could be displayed here instead of just the phone number.</p> <p>While writing this, I decided to install Signal, to see how it handles labeling chats without phonebook access. I wasn’t surprised to learn Signal choses the user friendly and logical option - displaying the participant’s name, with the phone number below it in smaller text:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.mattbearman.com/assets/img/blog/whatsapp-contacts/signal.png" alt="Signal Chats"></p> <p>Signal also helps distinguish between chats with users who haven’t added a profile image, by generating a uniquely coloured circle containing their initial. This isn’t unique to Signal, or even a new idea, it’s a tried and tested pattern. Compared with WhatsApp’s “generic bust”, it presents further evidence that WhatsApp is made deliberately hard to use if you don’t give it access to your contacts:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.mattbearman.com/assets/img/blog/whatsapp-contacts/signal-vs-whatsapp.png" alt="Signal vs WhatsApp default profile pictures"></p> <p>When I first installed WhatsApp I didn’t give it access to my contacts, as I tend to err on the side of minimal permissions, and I couldn’t see why it would <em>need</em> access. However, it didn’t take long for me to become frustrated with this user experience. I was constantly struggling to find conversations, or identify who was talking in group chats.</p> <p>I asked a friend with more WhatsApp experience if there was a way to make it show names instead of phone numbers. Their response was <strong><em>“Oh, that’s easy. You just need to give it access to your contacts.”</em></strong> This wasn’t the solution I was hoping for, and I resisted for as long as possible. Yet eventually the dark pattern wore me down, and I granted WhatsApp access to my contacts.</p> <p>I joined WhatsApp in late 2014, at which point they’d already been acquired by Facebook. I find myself wondering if this was a preexisting pattern, or something that happened after the acquisition, possibly at the behest of Facebook.</p> <p>Using display names as the primary identifier would be a vastly improved experience for those who chose not to give WhatsApp access to their contacts. Instead WhatsApp provides this unnecessarily worse experience, in an attempt to gain access to user’s contacts. And it works.</p> <p>I’d love to be able to say that I’ll be replacing WhatsApp with an alternative like Signal, but WhatsApp’s network effect is a strong one, and it’s currently how I keep in touch with my family.</p> <p><em>– Matt</em></p> </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called.

The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="8.13.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><h3 id="viewer-foo"><span><span>We live in a digital age, technology has drastically changed how we live and keeping fit is no exception </span></span></h3><p id="viewer-9veah"><span>Because of the pandemic, more and more people have had to transition to working out at home, and as with most aspects of going into lockdown, technology has helped make that transition a lot easier. Here are 6 ways that technology is revolutionising working out at home whilst gyms have been closed! Will we ever need to go back?</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6dj21"><span>Wearable Technology </span></h2><p id="viewer-d9mjp"><span>Although it's been around for a while, wearable technology plays an important part in people fitness routines, such as fitness trackers which are always gaining in popularity with <span>one in five Americans now owning one. However, </span><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>it is debated</u></a><span> whether or not thes</span>e devices <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>help you to move more and get healthier</u></a>, because people mistake them for <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>motivational tools</u></a> whereas, in fact, the reason devices like Fitbit and Apple Watch exist is to help improve your fitnes<span>s routine, not make you stick to it. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-4eokf"><span>Wearable technology can provide you with valuable data and analysis into your performance, whether you're running, swimming or working out, by giving information about your heart rate, calories burned and more. The <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>new Apple Watch</u></a> will even tell you about your <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>blood oxygen level!</u></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-rnpl"><span>Virtual Training Apps</span></h2><p id="viewer-ei0tn"><span>Mobile fitness apps have also taken the world by storm and with lockdowns around the world due to the pandemic, many people have turned to these apps to make the most of their time at home. Nowadays there are hundreds of fitness apps available covering almost any aspect of fitness and health you can think of.</span></p><p id="viewer-6ujkj"><span>There is no doubt that these apps are having an enormous impact on the industry, thanks to the practicality of having a "virtual trainer" on your phone but that isn't to say that they're better than having a personal trainer and a gym membership. Although some of these apps, especially home workout apps, may promise amazing results, for the moment they still can't compete with the advice from a personal trainer and the variety of equipment available at a gym. </span></p><p id="viewer-8caip"><span>These apps are probably best for when you're on the move, tracking things like running and cycling or if you simply haven't got the time to go to the gym. </span></p><h2 id="viewer-f5fkr"><span>Gamification</span></h2><p id="viewer-7p4vf"><span>Despite being a relatively new addition to the fitness world, this new gym trend seems quite promising. Gamification is <span>the application of typical elements of game playing like point scoring, competition with others and rules of play to other areas of activity, in this case, fitness.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-fc5od"><span>When gamification is present in a fitness experience, it creates a fun, challenging environment for participants by creating <!-- -->lead boards and a sense of achievement and competition. This tech often exists in training apps, allowing you and your friends to see each other's performance like in the Strava and Nike Training apps, but gyms are now trying to integrate it too.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-e1g3g"><span><span>Suggested Articles:</span></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-aqpj0"><p><span>⌚️</span><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Fitness Trackers: Helping us Get Fit or Just Another Gadget</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-2udnu"><p><strong>🍎 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Apple Event September 2020, everything you need to know</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-2o9hk"><p><strong>📱 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/smartphones-the-true-cost-of-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Smartphones: The True Cost of Upgrades</u></strong></a><strong> ♻️</strong></p></li></ul><h2 id="viewer-98ft4"><span><strong>Smart, Connected Equipment </strong></span></h2><p id="viewer-evclh"><span>Some Gyms are now starting to offer smart and connected equipment to their members, offering them the ability to move from one gym to the other and <!-- -->continue to feed into their own personal data bank of performances. </span></p><p id="viewer-4c64s"><span>This new generation of equipment includes <!-- -->Bluetooth connectivity equipped spin cycles, treadmills and step machines and more! </span></p><h2 id="viewer-r6lc"><span>Virtual Reality Fitness</span></h2><p id="viewer-2i1v5"><span>Some gyms have even started using Virtual Reality (VR) fitness equipment with machines such as <!-- -->VirZOOM,<!-- --> a blend of stationary bikes and VR games and the <!-- -->Icaros flying machine<!-- -->, a core &amp; upper body focused VR. The main benefit of this is, of course, adding a bit of fun to your workouts, because there is no doubt that training your core while flying through space on your Icaros will be a bit more exciting than a set of lame crunches!</span></p><p id="viewer-915mg"><span>This ability to make have fun whilst working out and not have it all be about data and performance could be a game-changer for the industry, but in it's current state, VR fitness is by no means perfect. The obvious disadvantage is the awkwardness of working out in a headset, but that's not all, being a relatively new technology, debates on how long you should spend using a VR headset and what effects it could have on you brain and eyes in the long term are being had.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-d446h"><span>The Full Gym Experience - At Home! </span></h2><p id="viewer-77nna"><span>We've talked about virtual training apps, fitness trackers and connected equipment, but what if all this was to come in one, ultimate home fitness package?

<p><strong>Work in progress</strong>: I still need to clean this up &amp; add the complete source code. ETA for a more or less done version is Soon(TM).<br>
<strong>Last updated</strong>: 2020/09/10 because how the eff did this end up on the front page of Hacker News? :D<br>
<strong>Suggestions welcome</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/AnotherKamila/kamila.is/issues/new?labels=teaching&amp;title=[teaching/how-routers-work]+Title">complain</a> if something is unclear or wrong!</p>

<p>This is the inside view of how exactly a router operates. You only need to know this if you are poking inside a router implementation. If that is the case, my condolences.</p>

<p>At the end of this exposition, I will give you the complete source code to a functional router (written in <a href="https://p4.org/">P4</a>, the new &amp; shiny software-defined networking thing). My aim is that you will understand every line of that.</p>

<p>I accompany my explanations below with some P4 code. I think it is useful to read it even if you’ve never seen P4, because it shows a bit more detail than the text and I believe that it is sufficiently pseudocode-ish. Here is a summary of what you need to know to read it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>everything happens per packet</li>
  <li><code>hdr</code> are the packet’s parsed headers</li>
  <li><code>standard_metadata</code> is how you tell the switch to do things with the packet (like send it on a specific port)</li>
  <li><code>meta</code> are user-defined in-memory variables which can be used e.g. for matching in tables</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Figuring out what should be done with packets is done by <em>the control plane/in the slow path/on the CPU/by the controller</em> or similar phrases. I will refer to all of this as “the control plane”.</li>
  <li>Actually forwarding the packets  is done by <em>the data plane/in the fast path/in the hardware/in the switch</em> and such. I will refer to this as “the data plane”.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24436585">Cyph0n on HN did a good job explaining this distinction.</a></p>



<p>A <em>switch</em> (or an L2 switch :-) ) is an L2-only<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> thing. It knows about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses and ports<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. It does <strong>not</strong> know about anything like IP addresses. It has a <strong>MAC table</strong>: it maps MAC addresses to ports.</p>

<p>A <em>router</em> (or an L3 switch by some people’s vocabulary) operates on L3 only. It knows about L3 stuff such as IP addresses and interfaces and hosts. It does <strong>not</strong> know about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses or ports.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> In fact, the routing parts of the router would not have to be changed at all if you decided to use something other than ethernet on L2. It has a <strong>routing table</strong> (details later): a table of subnets/prefixes and how to reach them.</p>

<p>What you normally call a router (that box sitting over there) is actually a router (for handling L3) and one or more switches (for handling L2), and some glue in between. They may in fact be separate chips in hardware.</p>

<p>You need glue to put together the L2 and the L3. This “L2.5” glue is ARP (or NDP for IPv6). It usually lives in the router, but it is glue, not routing, and you can think about it separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-plane-life-of-a-packet">The Data Plane: Life of a Packet</h2>

<p>When a packet arrives and needs to be sent further, these things have to happen to it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It needs to be <em>routed</em>: the <strong>router</strong>, based on L3 information, decides where it needs to go, in L3 speak – it will decide which <em>host</em> to send it to, but not how. This corresponds to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table">routing table</a></em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be passed down to L2: this is where the L2.5 ARP/NDP <strong>glue</strong> translates the L3-speak IP address to L2-speak MAC address. This is the <em>ARP table</em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be <em>forwarded</em> on the correct port: the <strong>switch</strong> puts the packet on the correct port. This is the <em>MAC table</em>.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="life-of-a-packet-now-properly">Life of a Packet, Now Properly</h2>

<h3 id="1-it-needs-to-be-routed-l3router">1. “It needs to be routed”: L3/router</h3>

<p>The packet has a destination IP address. This is matched in the <em>routing table</em>, using a longest-prefix match (LPM), i.e. it matches IP address prefixes. It may either be for a host the router is directly connected to (on some interface), or it may need to be sent further, through a <em>gateway</em> (through some interface). Therefore: <strong>The routing table maps a <em>prefix</em> to either <em>a next hop through a gateway and an interface</em>, or <em>a direct connection through an interface</em></strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>routing_table : Prefix -&gt; NextHop (GatewayIP, Interface) | Direct Interface
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the next hop’s IP address is in the router’s memory only: it does not appear in the packet at any time.</p>

<p>The P4 code defining the IPv4 routing table is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>action ipv4_through_gateway(ipv4_addr_t gateway, interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = gateway;  // send through the gateway
}

action ipv4_direct(interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = hdr.ipv4.dst_addr;  // send directly to the destination
}

table ipv4_routing {
    key = {
        hdr.ipv4.dst_addr: lpm;  // match prefixes
    }
    actions = {
        ipv4_through_gateway;    // ipv4_through_gateway(gateway, iface)
        ipv4_direct;             // ipv4_direct(iface)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();     // If there is no route, drop it -- in reality, we might want to
                                 // send an ICMP "No route to host" packet.
                                 // Note that this is the default route, so control plane might
                                 // want to set a default gateway here instead of dropping.
    size = ROUTING_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(and the exact same thing for IPv6)</p>

<h3 id="2-it-needs-to-be-passed-down-l25arp-glue">2. “It needs to be passed down”: L2.5/ARP glue</h3>

<p>If we did not drop the packet because there was no route, we now know the IP address and interface of the next hop. (Note that this is a host that is connected to us directly – it is sitting on the same wire.)
We need to translate this into an L2 MAC address in order to pass it to the switch. We do it via the ARP table:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arp_table : (IPv4Address, Interface) -&gt; MACAddress
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: <code>Interface</code> conceptually belongs there, but <code>IPv4Address</code> should be unique. We need to store the interface in the control plane anyway, because we want to pre-emptively re-send ARP requests when an entry is about to expire, but in the data plane it is not strictly necessary.</p>

<p>An interesting question arises here: What do we do if there is no match, i.e. when we don’t know the MAC address for the IP? First, we send an ARP request. Then, most routers drop the packet (relying on either retransmissions or “nobody will miss it”). Storing the packet until the ARP reply comes back (or until it expires) would also work, but usually isn’t done.
Sending ARP requests is normally done in the control plane, because the ARP requests need to be throttled and expired and such.</p>

<p>P4 code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>action set_dst_mac(mac_addr_t dst_addr) {
    hdr.ethernet.dst_addr = dst_addr;
}

table ipv4_arp {
    key = {
        meta.ipv4_next_hop: exact;     // next_hop is the host we found in the routing step; we want to send to that
        // meta.out_interface: exact;  // conceptually this belongs here, but actually next_hop should be unique, so
                                       // we can leave it out
    }
    actions = {
        set_dst_mac;                // set_dst_mac(mac)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IPv6 uses NDP instead of ARP, which is different but the same ;-)</p>

<h3 id="3-it-needs-to-be-forwarded-l2switch">3. “It needs to be forwarded”: L2/switch</h3>

<p>This is L2 / the switch. It works on each interface separately (it could be multiple chips in hardware). It gets a packet with some destination MAC address, and it decides on which port it should put it. It uses a <em>MAC table</em> to do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mac_table : MACAddress -&gt; Port
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>P4 code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// note: we're operating on metadata.out_interface

action set_out_port(port_t ports) {
    standard_metadata.egress_spec = ports;
}

action broadcast() {
    // Implementation depends on the switch.
    // In v1model, use a multicast group corresponding to all ports on metadata.out_interface.
}

// we call it dmac -- see below why
table dmac {
    key = {
        hdr.ethernet.dst_addr: exact;
    }
    actions = {
        set_out_port;  // set_out_port(port)
        broadcast;     // no params, uses metadata.out_interface
                       // remember to set broadcast for 0xffffffffffff in the control plane
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;  // we can have at most as many ports as MAC addresses
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: Real switches are a bit more complicated than that: for example, redundant links mean that a MAC address may be on more than one port. However, you will notice when you need to think about this. Normally considering the simple version is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="the-logic-applying-the-tables">The logic: Applying the tables</h3>

<ol>
  <li>apply routing =&gt; find the next hop (either gateway or direct)</li>
  <li>apply ARP translation to the “next hop” host</li>
  <li>send out on the right port</li>
</ol>

<p>In P4:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>apply {
    routing.apply();  // fills out metadata.next_hop
    arp.apply();      // sets pkt.ethernet.dst_addr to the MAC of next_hop
    dmac.apply();     // sends out on the port for pkt.ethernet.dst_addr
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Note: While this is conceptually correct, we actually also want to apply the auxiliary table mentioned below. The full code contains that.)</p>

<h2 id="the-control-plane-how-to-fill-the-tables">The Control Plane: How to Fill the Tables</h2>

<p>Starting at the bottom for a change:</p>

<h3 id="l3--routing-table">L3 / routing table</h3>

<p>Filled out by the control plane, depending on the context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your home router, it probably has only two entries: the local network (something like 192.168.0.0/24) =&gt; direct on the internal interface, and a default route via your ISP’s gateway on the external interface.
 In this case, the routing table is static and is filled out by the firmware according to the settings.</li>
  <li>In a small company router, there might be a direct network such as 10.0.0.0/24, a remote office in 10.0.1.0/24 via a VPN server, and a default route from the ISP.
 The default route and the direct route would also be filled …</li></ul></div></div>

      <p>It is mostly acknowledged that developers should generally be responsible for their code on every stage of its lifecycle.
Solving engineering problems involves not just coding, but testing, deploying, debugging, monitoring, and support.
Thanks to the devops movement, this view is more of a mainstream nowadays (although in the context of this post I’d rather use a term <em>engineering culture</em> instead of <em>devops</em>).
Edsger Dijkstra might have phrased this better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a mistake to think that programmers wares are programs.
Programmers have to produce trustworthy solutions and present it in the form of cogent arguments.
Programs source code is just the accompanying material to which these arguments are to be applied to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, I regularly notice that developers misunderstand and underestimate the responsibility they carry.
Some think that having a code work on their machine is enough to consider a job to be done. That fixing and preventing issues in production is none of their business.
Or that error handling, monitoring, and graceful degradation are some magical, extra efforts that only special “devops” people do.
The others are simply unaware of the complexities of real world and of the differences between a production environment and their local setup.</p>
<p>This post is mostly for and about the latter. From the viewpoint of a web/backend developer, we’ll review a few common things that can go wrong in production, which usually are overlooked in a local environment.
The discussion will be broad and somewhat shallow, but there are references to a more in-depth content in each section. In no way this post is exhaustive, but still I would have been glad to get my hands on these notes at the beginning of my career.</p>

<h3 id="1-human-errors">1. Human errors</h3>
<p>We begin with an simple, maybe even boring category of incidents first, because they are as pervasive as they are easy to prevent in the hindsight.
“Human errors”, in my understanding, include a variety of little things that devs tend to forget before releasing their code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding configuration files or variables for the production environment</li>
<li>Setting up cron tasks and daemons</li>
<li>Running migration scripts</li>
<li>Basic sanity-checking</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues usually arise when the deployment process consists of multiple steps which haven’t been coordinated properly.
It is generally expected that a continuous delivery system (such as jenkins or gitlab) is supposed to manage the release with a single button or command.
In practice though, the feature to be released might be too complex to be deployed automatically.
It might require a simultaneous release of several projects, manual execution of migration scripts, tweaking production environment, and so on.
This is when human factor comes into play, allowing a plenty of room for mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>How to prevent human errors</strong>:
While it might be tempting to keep everything in mind, I recommend to document any deployment process that consists of two or more steps.
It doesn’t have to be elaborate, but it should be spelled out as a series of simple steps.</p>
<p>For more complex scenarios, a detailed release plan explaining the dependencies between the steps and a possible rollback strategy is a must.</p>
<p><strong>To learn more</strong>, check out an article on <a href="https://jbd.dev/prod-readiness/">Production readiness</a> by Jaana Dogan.</p>
<h3 id="2-unexpected-environment">2. Unexpected environment</h3>
<p>A code doesn’t just run by itself. It depends, among other things, on the operating system and its configuration, the other software and libraries on the machine.
Oftentimes we spend considerable efforts tuning things on our development machine to make everything work nicely, but forget about that when it comes to deployment, or recon it’s no longer our responsibility.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.sergeyev.info/images/works-on-my-machine/dependencies-layers.png" alt="Layers of application environment"> <figcaption>
            <p>Layers of application environment</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We usually consider the application, a central piece of the diagram above, to be a an ultimate outcome of our work. However, the outer layers of its environment require control and care too.</p>
<p>In interpreted languages, the application comes along with its libraries (like <code>node_modules</code> for javascript, for example) that aren’t usually kept with the source code, so we have to handle their delivery and versioning separately.</p>
<p>Next come additional dependencies and services that are supposed to run alongside a primary application, labelled as “sidecar apps” on the diagram. Programs in Java or PHP, for example, require a VM or an interpreter on the machine where they run. Or, when working with mongodb, it is recommended to spin up a <code>mongos</code> instance close to your code to proxy database queries through it.</p>
<p>The outer layer of software environment is the operating system, its configuration, and system libraries needed to run the service. Applications may have varying and loose requirements for those: some can run almost anywhere, while the others may be locked to a specific version of, say, linux or libc.</p>
<p>When preparing a software for deployment, the requirements for every layer must be considered.
In my experience though, the further a layer is from the core application, the higher a chance that a programmer won’t account for it, or won’t consider themselves in a position to do so.
Indeed, in most companies software engineers aren’t responsible for configuring operating systems in production. But I argue that at least <em>understanding</em> and <em>documenting</em> the environment requirements is a responsibility of a good software engineer anyway. Otherwise, a chance of ending up in a “works on my machine” situation just because you forgot to configure some external dependency becomes embarrassingly high.</p>
<p><strong>How to handle unexpected environments</strong>:</p>
<p>While there is no single (nor simple) solution, I believe the developers should aspire to</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the environment reproducible.</li>
<li>Ensure the development environment stays as close to the production as possible.</li>
<li>Test in production.</li>
</ol>
<p>Containerization is a mainstream solution when it comes to the first two points. It has become so widespread in the recent years, I will not even spend time describing it in details.
But while bringing containers into your workflow may actually settle the question of reproducibility, it comes with its own cost.
Managing containers is not easy, and the abundance and complexity of the tools to do that is quite overwhelming.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it might be enough to just document the requirements of your software and share it with your team.
That is especially true if there are no designated people around to handle the infrastructural burden of virtualization. Also, this simple approach should work well if your project is small or if you are just starting to learn how everything works. When doing so, it is fine to do things manually and incrementally, rather than go all the way kubernetes at once. I think advice like “automate everything and never SSH to a server”, when given to a beginner, might actually do more harm than good by focusing too much attention on the abstractions and tooling.</p>
<p>And what about <em>testing in production</em>?
The thing is, there is no way a testing/development environment could match production exactly. Yes, even if everything runs in containers or identical VMs.
Even when software components of the environment are exactly the same, the infrastructure level below them (see next section for details) can’t be.
That’s why it is important to have ways of running and testing your services in production, while not affecting the real users.
A starting point in that direction could be creating a separate application instance that is only available from a private domain or with a special cookie (such an instance is usually called “staging” or “pre-production”). Then make sure important features are tested on that instance before being released.</p>
<p><strong>To learn more</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read up on “infrastructure as code” approach and try out different tools like docker, ansible, terraform, to make your environment reproducible. Go incrementally and study the documentation.</li>
<li><a href="https://increment.com/testing/i-test-in-production/">“I test in prod”</a>, a piece on increment.com acknowledging that some kinds of problems can only be revealed in production.</li>
<li>A series of articles <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-in-production-the-safe-way-18ca102d0ef1">“Testing in production, the safe way”</a> by Cindy Sridharan is a great place to dig deeper into the subject.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-unexpected-infrastructure">3. Unexpected infrastructure</h3>
<p>Outside of a software environment, there’s a world of hardware and networks, that can (unsurprisingly) also cause a variety of incidents.
Software developers tend to neglect that, because usually their local infrastructure looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.sergeyev.info/images/works-on-my-machine/development-infrastructure.png" alt="Development infrastructure"> 
</figure>

<p>In such a setup, there is practically zero chance of facing the issues that happen in production all the time. Things like network congestion or disruption, latency spikes, proxy misconfiguration, DNS are all too easy to forget about. It is tempting to think everything will forever run smoothly and error-free as it does on a local machine.</p>
<p>Sure, the diagram I’ve pictured is simplistic; your development setup might actually be more advanced and involve actual networking. Still, it is generally quite stable and homogenous.</p>
<p>The real production infrastructure though is much more complex:
</p><figure>
    <img src="https://blog.sergeyev.info/images/works-on-my-machine/production-infrastructure-3.png" alt="Production infrastructure"> 
</figure>

<p>This is again a simplification, but it conveys the idea that there are many intermediate nodes between client and server: routers, cell towers, proxies, you name it.
What’s worse is that the path of every user is often unique: starting with a device they use, ending with an ISP and VPN they’re connected to. It means different users might experience different issues that are hard to reproduce. Lastly, the real “server” is not a single entity, but a collection of services interconnected via the network, subject to faults of their own.</p>
<p>Clearly, unexpected faults can happen on every step of the diagram above, and we can’t just …</p></article></div>

          <p>I really love the feeling of writing a bash pipeline. It’s fun to string commands together, peek at the output, add another couple pipes to massage the data closer to my goal. I even gave a short class on them: <a href="https://github.com/bgschiller/shell-challenges">bgschiller/shell-challenges</a>.</p>

<p>But it’s easy to find that a pipeline that was delightful to write is painful to maintain. Even if you’re the one reading it a month later, it’s difficult to remember what the purpose of each piece is. This is a trick I learned to break pipelines into intermediate files for more readable scripts.</p>

<h3 id="the-task">The task</h3>

<p>The product I’m working on has a list of “Alarms”—conditions that the end user needs to be alerted to. We also have a localization file for each supported language that maps Alarm names to human-readable names, descriptions, etc. There are a lot of alarms, enough to make it difficult to keep track of which ones are already translated. This calls for a script!</p>

<p>The Alarms file looks something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- Alarms.xml --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;config</span> <span>name=</span><span>"AlarmConfig"</span><span>&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;AlarmList</span> <span>name=</span><span>"IngredientAlarms"</span> <span>version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;Alarm</span> <span>name=</span><span>"MozzarellaTooWarm"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;!-- some alarm-specific stuff here --&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/Alarm&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;Alarm</span> <span>name=</span><span>"PizzaTooCold"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/Alarm&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the localization something like this:</p>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div><div><pre><code><span>[{</span> <span>stringId</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>alarm_id_MozzarellaTooWarm</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>localString</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>MozzarellaTooWarm</span><span>"</span> <span>},</span>
 <span>{</span> <span>stringId</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>alarm_title_MozzarellaTooWarm</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>localString</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Mozzarella Too Warm</span><span>"</span> <span>},</span>
 <span>{</span> <span>stringId</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>alarm_description_MozzarellaTooWarm</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>localString</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>The mozzarella has become too warm and must be used within the next five minutes</span><span>"</span> <span>},</span>
  <span>//...</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="make-a-plan">Make a plan</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Extract the alarms names from Alarms.xml using <code>xpath</code>.</li>
  <li>Each alarm needs to be prefixed with <code>alarm_id_</code>, <code>alarm_title_</code>, <code>alarm_description_</code>, <code>alarm_operator_actions_</code> in order to match the localization file. Figure out some way to do that.</li>
  <li>Extract the <code>"stringId"</code> from each entry in the localization file. Oh, but there are other entries for things that need to be localized, and aren’t alarms at all. Figure out a way to filter those out. Probably use <code>jq</code> for that.</li>
  <li>Use <code>diff</code> to compare the expected keys with the actual keys.</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn’t a post on how to make bash pipelines, so I’ll gloss over that piece. Here’s what I came up with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>diff <span>\</span>
  &lt;<span>(</span><span>join</span> <span>-j</span> 99999 <span>\</span>
    &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>'alarm_id_
alarm_title_
alarm_description_
alarm_operator_actions_'</span><span>)</span> <span>\</span>
    &lt;<span>(</span>xpath <span>-q</span> <span>-e</span> config/AlarmList/Alarm/@name Alarms.xml |
      <span>cut</span> <span>-d</span><span>=</span> <span>-f2</span> | <span>tr</span> <span>-d</span> <span>'"'</span><span>)</span> <span>\</span>
    | <span>tr</span> <span>-d</span> <span>' '</span> | <span>sort</span><span>)</span> <span>\</span>
  &lt;<span>(</span>jq <span>'.[] | select(.stringId | startswith("alarm_")) |
        .stringId '</span> i18n/en.json | <span>sort</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s convoluted and kinda impressive in that way. But not code you’d be happy to maintain.</p>

<h3 id="one-step-at-a-time">One step at a time</h3>

<p>The prior step accomplished what we needed, but it was pretty difficult to see what was going on. In my opinion, that’s because</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nothing has a name. Because each process substitution is fed directly into a parent, nothing ever receives a name. We need to name our intermediates!</li>
  <li>No comments. It’s difficult to add comments because every line ends in a backslash, meaning “continue this line as if I hadn’t pressed enter”. Bash doesn’t allow you to say “continue this line” and also add a comment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see if we can tease out each part using intermediate files.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cat</span> <span>&gt;</span> alarm_attrs <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>EOF</span><span>
alarm_id_
alarm_title_
alarm_description_
alarm_operator_actions_
</span><span>EOF

</span>xpath <span>-q</span> <span>-e</span> config/AlarmList/Alarm/@name Alarms.xml |
  <span>cut</span> <span>-d</span><span>=</span> <span>-f2</span> | <span>tr</span> <span>-d</span> <span>'"'</span> <span>&gt;</span> expected_alarm_names

<span>join</span> <span>-j</span> 999 alarm_attrs expected_alarm_names |
  <span>tr</span> <span>-d</span> <span>' '</span> | <span>sort</span> <span>&gt;</span> expected_localization_keys

jq <span>-r</span> <span>'.[] | select(.stringId | startswith("alarm_")) |
       .stringId'</span> en.json | <span>sort</span> <span>&gt;</span> actual_localization_keys
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is better! Each piece can be understood in isolation, and the dependencies between steps are explictly tracked with named files. All that’s left is to add comments and some error checking, and clean up our intermediate files.</p>

<p>Cleaning up after ourselves is a little tricky. Ideally, we’d like to avoid leaving the intermediate results files laying around regardless of whether the script exits normally, crashes, or is cancelled with ctrl-c. We can use <code>trap</code> to handle this. <code>trap</code> sets up a command to run when a “signal” occurs. We’ll put all our intermediate files into a directory and use <code>trap</code> to delete that directory when a signal that indicates our script is ending fires.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>set</span> <span>-ef</span> <span>-o</span> pipefail

<span>readonly </span><span>script_name</span><span>=</span><span>`</span><span>basename</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span><span>`</span>

<span>#  2) all the names actually present in the localization file.</span>
<span># A complication: the location file uses a flat format to</span>
<span># store the id, title, description, and operator_actions:</span>
<span>#   { "stringId": "alarm_id_MozzarellaTooWarm", ... },</span>
<span>#   { "stringId": "alarm_title_MozzarellaTooWarm", ... },</span>
<span>#   { "stringId": "alarm_description_MozzarellaTooWarm", ... },</span>
<span>#   { "stringId": "alarm_operator_actions_MozzarellaTooWarm", ... },</span>
<span># We want to check that *all* of these keys are present, so</span>
<span># we use a cross product of (alarm names) X (those attributes)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><b>Workers who make iPhones in the 21st century</b>, are twenty-five times more exploited than textile workers in England in the 19th century. Based on a marxist analysis, the current&nbsp;<i>rate of exploitation </i>is&nbsp;2458%.</span></p><div>
<p><span><span><b>W</b></span></span>e are interested in looking at the production
of the iPhone – a commodity – through the
framework of a Marxist analysis. We are interested not in being angry at Apple and Foxconn
alone, but in being able to measure how much
workers are exploited to produce this commodity. In other words, we are interested in measuring <b>the rate of exploitation</b>.</p><p>

The rate of exploitation is one of the most
important concepts in Marx’s theory. This
measurement allows us to show how much the
worker contributes to the increase of value in
the production process. It shows that even if the
worker is paid more, by the special magic of
mechanisation and of efficient management of
the production process, the rate of exploitation
increases. The rate expresses quantitatively the
contradictory interests of the capitalists and of
the workers. There is a radical politics implicit in
the analysis of the rate of exploitation. It enables workers to see how much of the share of
the value produced is appropriated from them
by the capitalists, and to therefore make the
case for a different way to organise production
and to end exploitation.</p><p>

To understand the rate of exploitation, we have
to first grasp what Marx means by the commodity itself and what he means by value, a key term
in the Marxist system of economic thought.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C5uknsT1Qo8/XZCEHtKcdVI/AAAAAAAAFRU/ske4yAP-_xY8lyclVj_QI14X31w008uqQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/book2.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="536" data-original-width="542" height="316" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C5uknsT1Qo8/XZCEHtKcdVI/AAAAAAAAFRU/ske4yAP-_xY8lyclVj_QI14X31w008uqQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/book2.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p>
What is a commodity? Marx begins his epic
work Capital (1867) with a discussion of the
commodity. ‘A commodity’, he notes, ‘is an object outside us, a thing that by its properties
satisfies human wants of some sort or another.
The nature of such wants, whether, for instance,
they spring from the stomach or from fancy,
makes no difference. Neither are we concerned
to know how the object satisfies these wants,
whether directly as a means of subsistence, or
indirectly as means of production’. The commodity is a useful object. But it is more than a
useful thing that serves a purpose to a consumer. It is also something that can be sold – something that enables the person who has it made
to realise a profit. Inside the commodity, then, is
both <b>use value</b> and <b>value</b>.</p><p>

The use value of the commodity is merely its
utility, something that is left to the consumer.
An iPhone is a good example, because it can
be used for many things: to make a phone call,
to watch a video, to use as a compass, to hold
onto when you are feeling awkward (or even to
improve your image).</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XSTB0AJ3dE8/XZCEcFG4l8I/AAAAAAAAFRc/zQgbE9cGZ20opRyyiarpiQQVm8vlXer2QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/values.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="595" data-original-width="465" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XSTB0AJ3dE8/XZCEcFG4l8I/AAAAAAAAFRc/zQgbE9cGZ20opRyyiarpiQQVm8vlXer2QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/values.png"></a></p>
<p>
The expression of the value of the commodity
(i.e. exchange value) is the price of the commodity. We are aware that there is a rich and
long debate amongst Marxists over the relationship between prices and the value of a
commodity. This debate is known as the transformation problem – namely the problem of the
transformation of values to prices of production. Nevertheless, for our iPhone example, we
believe that this level of concreteness need not
detain us. We are still able to capture something
significant. In the case of the iPhone X, the expression of its value is $999. The value is merely
what the commodity is able to command in
the market. But behind that price is a mass of
crystallised values, which can be grouped into
three parts of the total value: <b>constant capital</b>,
<b>variable capital,</b> and <b>surplus value</b>. These are
key concepts for Marxist analysis.</p><p>

<b><span>Constant capital</span></b></p><p>

Various raw materials are brought on to the
factory floor that are to be transformed by the
actions of labour and machines into commodities. These raw materials – and other auxiliary
materials, including the instruments of labour
(machines, tools, etc.) – have already been
fashioned from nature elsewhere. Inside these
raw materials, which are not really ‘raw’ any
longer, is embodied labour. The values of the
various raw materials and instruments of labour
are quantitatively fixed in terms of their labour
content. This fixed amount of value is now
transferred to the newly produced commodities
in the process of production. Its value enters
into the new commodities. Karl Marx calls the
values of the raw materials and the instruments
of labour <b>constant capital</b>.</p><p>

The constant capital for the iPhone includes
all of those minerals and metals that appear on the assembly line as well as the depreciated
parts of machines that work those raw materials.
These are then collectively transformed into
the iPhone. In the process of transformation,
the minerals, metals, and machines do not
alter their value. Their value is preserved in the
iPhone. The value remains constant.</p><p>

At the end of the process of production, the
total transferred value of those means of production – the raw materials, the machines, the
buildings – cannot be more than what they
originally contained in themselves. Their value,
which remains constant, is preserved in the
iPhone.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_pB4fCgz5I/XZCFCPeC69I/AAAAAAAAFRo/PocXIl65lesBDVnMU7IPnoRo6THryPOjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/capital.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="579" data-original-width="378" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_pB4fCgz5I/XZCFCPeC69I/AAAAAAAAFRo/PocXIl65lesBDVnMU7IPnoRo6THryPOjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/capital.png"></a></p>
<p>

<b><span>Variable capital.</span></b></p><p>

The capitalist firm makes an initial investment in
the production process:</p><ul>
<li>Wages and salaries for workers.</li>
<li>Expenses on all non-human inputs, notably
tools, machinery, buildings, energy, and so
on.</li>
</ul><p>
The latter expense – the expense on all non-human inputs – is known as <b>constant capital</b>, as
explained above.</p><p>

The former expense – the expense on wages
and salaries – is known as variable capital.
To simplify our calculation, we assume that all
workers are productive in the Marxist sense
(namely, that they produce surplus value and
do not merely distribute surplus value – as do
‘unproductive’ workers, such as those who are
involved in trade).</p><p>

In the capitalist system, people are ‘free’ in two
ways. They are free from bondage and free to
starve. The freedom from bondage and from
the means to feed themselves forces people to sell their capacity to labour to those with capital
(land or money). What the person sells is not
themselves (since they are free from bondage),
but they sell their labour power in exchange
for wages. The wages correspond to a certain
amount of money – representing a certain
amount of value – that is necessary to satisfy the
consumption needs of the workers.</p><p>

Marx called labour power <i>a peculiar commodity</i>. Like other commodities, this one must have
two aspects – a use value and a value. Wages
are the <b>exchange value</b> of labour power,
whereas labour is the use value of labour power. This distinction between the use value of
labour power and the exchange value of labour
power is fundamental to a Marxist understanding of surplus value and its production.</p><p>

In a given working day, workers transform
their capacity to labour into an act of labour.
Their various skills are utilised to transform raw materials and machines into commodities.</p><blockquote>
 Workers produce more value than they are paid in wages. This extra value is called&nbsp;<b>surplus value</b>.</blockquote><p>
During the working day and given the conditions of work, the total amount of value produced by the workers exceeds what is needed
for their own consumption and reproduction.
The value they require for their consumption
and reproduction – represented in wages – is
only a part of the value that they make during
the working day.</p><p>

Workers produce more value than they are
paid in wages. This extra value is called
<b>surplus value</b>. If the management of labour
changes or if the machines work at a different
speed, then either more or less value is produced in a day, which means that the surplus
value can be increased (or decreased). The fact
that labour power – this peculiar commodity –
has the quality of producing an extra amount of
value than what is needed for its own reproduction makes it <b>variable capital</b>.</p><p>

<b><span>Surplus Value</span></b></p><p>

The various raw materials that are on the assembly line, the machines, and the electricity that
help fashion the raw materials, would all be idle
without the necessary work of the labour power
put into the system by the workers. The workers
take the raw materials and the tools and shape
them into a commodity. It is the input of the
labour power that is crucial. Unlike any other
commodity, the labour power purchased from
the worker has to produce these new values.
When the workers tire, they go home and reproduce their labour power to be sold again.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JPwsXDRUiDU/XZCFarXi6jI/AAAAAAAAFRw/luib4DD_tPkBGGIdJ0FOfSFmS-HNhJOmACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/SV.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="595" data-original-width="566" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JPwsXDRUiDU/XZCFarXi6jI/AAAAAAAAFRw/luib4DD_tPkBGGIdJ0FOfSFmS-HNhJOmACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/SV.png"></a></p>
<p>
The workers sell their labour power for a set
amount of money. When they start to work on
the production of commodities, it takes them
only a fraction of their working day to make
enough commodities to cover their own wages.
Marx called that the <b>necessary labour time</b>. It
was ‘necessary’ because in different epochs and in different countries it takes different amounts
of goods and services to reproduce the worker’s depleted labour power. In some countries,
the standard of living is lower than that of
others, which means the necessary labour time
is also shorter. The remainder of the working
day – after the necessary labour time – is the
<b>surplus labour time</b>. It is the time that the
worker spends producing commodities that are
above and beyond the amount needed to be
produced to pay the wage bill of the worker.</p><p>

<b><span>Rate of Surplus Value</span></b></p><p>

Marx’s concept – the rate of exploitation – is
measured by using the categories of variable
capital and surplus value. Variable capital is
the share of the values produced in the process of production that goes to the workers.
Surplus value, on the other hand, is the share
of the values that goes to the capitalist. The ratio of surplus value to variable capital – or
s/v – can be seen as a quantitative expression
of the exploitation of workers, also called the
<b>rate of surplus value</b>.</p><p>

Take a hypothetical commodity whose total
value is $1,000. The constant capital is worth
$500. That capital – raw material, tools and energy – goes into the process of production and
remerges in a different form but with the value
intact. There is no change in its value. The variable capital – what the worker earns – is $250.
The surplus value – what the capitalist appropriates – is the amount of value created during
the surplus labour time, which in …</p></div></div>

<p>Elon Musk.

<b>Generational references</b> are a new memory management technique that's easy, deterministic, and <i>very</i> fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
This technique is the first ingredient in Vale's final <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory">hybrid-generational memory</a> design, which is even faster. Our eventual goal is to be as fast as Rust, and perhaps even as fast as C++, while being safer than both. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a>
</p>
<p>
This article explains how generational references work, how they compare to reference counting, and what makes it all so fast. <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it.
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want. <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>
</p>
<p>
In other languages, when a programmer frees an object and then accidentally dereferences a non-owning reference to it, it can cause memory unsafety and vulnerabilities. <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to detect this situation and react to it safely. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a><a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

 Generational Reference: More than just a pointer!</h2>

Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A pointer to the object.
</li>
<li>
A "target generation" integer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a> for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.

 No Aliasing Costs</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For example:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>launchShip</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>, <span><span><span>armada</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>List</span>&lt;<span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>)</span> <span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<br>    <p>  <span><span>armada</span><span>.</span><span>add</span>(<span>ship</span>)</span>;</p><p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  
<p>
As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.
</p>

</section>

      </div>
  


    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
  
<section>
<p>
Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

</section>

      </div>
  
<div>

      <div>
        <div>
    
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
 Half of these are aliasings and half are dealiasings. Aliasing happens whenever we access a member (e.g. <span>person.name</span>) or make a new reference (e.g. <span>&amp;person</span>).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note12" data-noteid="12">
<p><span>12</span></p><section>
<p>
 Many languages are able to skip a lot of the adjustments, using static analysis. For example, Lobster can remove up to 95%. Our experiment doesn't have those optimizations; it compares naive RC to naive generational references.

        <p><em>Thanks to Aneesh Edara for reviewing this post.</em></p>
<p>Covid is probably going to get much worse before it gets better. Vaccine rollout is <em>extremely slow</em>, for <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5240">no good reason</a>. In Massachusetts, where I currently reside, the government doesn’t expect to have vaccines <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/when-can-i-get-the-covid-19-vaccine">open to the general public until April to June</a>. On top of that, the UK and South African variants of the coronavirus are also <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i6doyTk6kHkGyKybq/covid-1-7-the-fire-of-a-thousand-suns#The_English_Strain__Are_We_F___ed__Is_it_Over_">fairly likely to wreak havoc</a>. Zvi Mowshowitz in the previous article predicts that things are likely to get <em>worse</em>, not better, by ~May.</p>
<p>In the meantime, how do we protect ourselves and those around us?</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-join-a-vaccine-trial">Why you should join a vaccine trial<a href="#why-you-should-join-a-vaccine-trial" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Joining a trial is a 50% shot of getting a vaccine now, which seems like a much better deal than a 100% shot of getting a vaccine several months down the line.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (In a trial, there’s a 50% chance you’re placed in the vaccine group and get the real vaccine, and a 50% chance you’re placed in the placebo and get nothing.)</p>
<p>It’s fast (takes &lt;1 week from intent to shot), safe (Phase 3 vaccines have already passed safety checks), and <em>they literally pay you for it</em>. The vaccine itself is also very likely to be effective; after all, the reason why it’s in Phase 3 trials is because it triggered good immune reactions in Phase 1/2.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in reducing the risk of you getting covid in the next few months, it thus seems like a good choice to make. It’s also a good altruistic choice, because your participation will probably speed up recruitment a tiny bit, making it possible that they finish the trial faster as a result.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-join-a-trial">How to join a trial<a href="#how-to-join-a-trial" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>You might think that with vaccines so far down the pipeline, and Moderna’s and Pfizer’s approved in the US, there would be no trials currently enrolling. <strong>This is not true</strong>. Many trials (Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZenenca, etc.) are still enrolling new participants. Here’s how to join one:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find a trial with an enrollment center near you. Good options include:</p>
<p>a. Search “covid vaccine trials near me” to see if there are any recent news articles on it.</p>
<p>b. Head to <a href="https://coviddash.org/">coviddash.org</a> to find the trial sites closest to you.</p>
<p>c. I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARJS1v7qOjUAF1H6BAR70U_crnEBAFHG5YAm2wG_x0Y/edit">list of websites here</a> if you aren’t able to find any local leads. This list is partially tailored towards Boston trials as of ~1 month ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign up on their website, and then <em>call the number they give you</em>. At least for me, I put in my email, but never got a text response. Only after calling to follow up were they able to schedule me, and I got a shot ~4 days after that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the trial site, get screened, and hopefully get a vaccine!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-experience">My experience<a href="#my-experience" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I joined the single-dose <a href="https://www.ensemblestudy.com/#!/">ENSEMBLE study</a>, by Johnson &amp; Johnson. On December 8, I received a shot (which was either a saline placebo or the real deal).</p>
<p>Some interesting things I learned through the process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time commitment</strong>: For me, I had a one-hour Zoom informed consent session, then a three hour trip to the hospital to get screened and injected. The trial lasts for 2 years, with periodic in-person followups after 1 month, 3 months, and continuing at progressively longer intervals. For J&amp;J, you also have to log twice weekly if you have had any symptoms of COVID-19, and if you do, you’ll have to come in again to receive a package of saliva tests and nasal swabs to take periodically.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving the study</strong>: You can leave the study at any time, <strong>even to receive another vaccine</strong>. Moreover, if you leave the study, they will also tell you if you got the placebo or the real vaccine. This means that if you got the placebo, you can get an approved vaccine as normal. (If you got the trial vaccine, it might not be a good idea or even necessary to get another vaccine, though.)</li>
<li><strong>What if the trial vaccine gets approved?</strong> In the case that the trial vaccine is approved, people are debating whether or not they should immediately vaccinate the placebo group or keep studying them. Regardless of the ethicality, it’s not entirely clear right now which option they’ll pick, but there is a chance you might get a <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/makers-successful-covid-19-vaccine-wrestle-options-many-thousands-who-received-placebos">blind crossover</a> or an accelerated dose.</li>
<li><strong>Payment</strong>: You do get paid to join a trial! Payment is ~$1000 for me, spread out across the various scheduled visits of the trial.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-cheap-personal-interventions">Other cheap personal interventions<a href="#other-cheap-personal-interventions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><strong>Purchase and use a P100 mask</strong>. P100 masks are industrial masks that filter 99.97% of particles. (Compare with the “gold standard” N95, which filters 95% of particles.)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/22/P100-PSA.html">A well-fitted P100 mask could reduce your risk of getting covid from an activity by 100x</a>. This is like, maybe better than a vaccine?? They also only cost like $30 on eBay. Just do it, it’ll be the last mask you’ll ever need to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Use <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/">microcovid.org</a> to calculate the risk of your activities</strong>. Know thy enemy. <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/">microCOVID</a> is a project that allows you to calculate your expected covid risk of any social activity, and tells you how dangerous it is if you aim to keep your risk of getting covid at ~1%/year.</p>
<p><strong>Install an Exposure Notification app on your phone</strong>. Check availability in your state <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/02/covid-tracing-apps-ens-android/">here</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and either download the app on Android, or enable it in Settings on iOS.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>yell at your representatives, health officials, etc.</strong> to speed up the vaccine rollout. Seriously.</p>

  <p><span>04 Jan 2021</span></p><p>Over the holidays, I got a <a href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/oh1-optical-heart-rate-sensor">Polar OH1+</a> as a Christmas present. Its an optical heart rate monitor with similar tech to those found in smart watches (including my Garmin running watch), but much more accurate (at least for running) due to being smaller &amp; lighter, as well as fitting against the fleshier upper arm:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcdav.is/public/oh1-small.jpg" alt="Polar OH1"></p>

<p>Like any modern gadget these days, it supports Bluetooth (specifically Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE/BTLE) for talking to your phone and/or smart watch. Which got me wondering, will it pair with a computer?</p>

<p><img src="https://jcdav.is/public/bluetooth.jpg" alt="It pairs"></p>

<p>This piqued my curiosity. I had long been at least somewhat curious about tracking my heart rate while say playing video games, if nothing else for curiosity. So how easy is it to grab data from this thing? As with the last few years, I had spent a bit of December doing a bunch of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> in rust, only to forget and have to re-learn everything the next year. So figured I could maybe try my hand at a “real” project.</p>

<p>(Note that though this part should work cross-platform, I couldn’t get bluetooth working from WSL, so this was all done natively on Windows).</p>

<p>Which of these do I want? The <a href="https://btprodspecificationrefs.blob.core.windows.net/assigned-values/16-bit%20UUID%20Numbers%20Document.pdf">Bluetooth UUID specifications</a> lists a bunch of different potentially interesting IDs, but they are all 16 bits, whereas are 128 bit. Making matters more confusing, <code>btleplug</code> ‘s UUID definition seems to allow for either:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>B16</span><span>(</span><span>u16</span><span>),</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However it seems like a lot of them seem to only differ in the 3rd and 4th bytes <sup><a href="#suff1">1</a></sup>, and those to roughly correspond to GATT Characteristic Ids, and in there is a <code>2A:37</code>, which represents Heart Rate Measurement - sounds promising.

<p>Endianness issues out of the way this….seems to be working?</p>

<p>At least that second number sure looks like a heart rate reading. To confirm this, I hopped over to the technical specifications for the Heart Rate Service (downloadable <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/">here</a>). Sure enough, byte 0 represents various flags and byte 1 is a heart rate measurement. The spec authors have even figured out support for heart rates &gt;255 on off chance you ever slap one of these bad boys on a hummingbird:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.1.1.2Heart Rate Measurement Value Field</p>

  <p>The Heart Rate Measurement Value field shall be included in the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic. While most human applications require support for only 255 bpm or less, special applications (e.g. animals) may require support for higher bpm values. If the Heart Rate Measurement Value is less than or equal to 255 bpm a UINT8 format should be used for power savings. If the Heart Rate Measurement Value exceeds 255 bpm a UINT16 format shall be used. See 3.1.1.1.1for additional requirements on the Heart Rate Value format change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other potentially interesting bit flags include a way to indicate if the sensor thinks it has lost skin contact.</p>

<h2 id="displaying-things">Displaying things</h2>

<p>Now its time to figure out a UI. Faced with a <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">large number of different options</a>, I ended up settling on the not-even-listed-there <a href="https://crates.io/crates/native-windows-gui">native-windows-gui crate</a> , throwing cross-platform support into the wind on the suspicion I would need easy access to the underlying win32 APIs, since it is largely just a series of nice convenience abstractions over those. Using the associated native-windows-derive macro crate, I had a basic UI setup working fairly quickly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Default,</span> <span>NwgUi)]</span>

<p>I was trying to avoid writing this post and had succeeded at that goal for almost 2 years. After some recent exchanges, I see the wisest move is the opposite. so, here goes.</p>

<p>In 2003 I was working at Amazon for the best manager I’ve ever had, Chris Pinkham. Chris had hired me the previous year as a network engineer, quickly promoting me to manager for the (ridiculously awesome) team. Chris was always pushing me to change the infrastructure, especially driving better abstraction and uniformity, essential for efficiently scaling. He wanted an all IP network instead of the mess of VLANs Amazon had at the time, so we designed it, built it, and worked with developers so their applications would work with it. He wanted anycast DNS, so we hacked up some routing software and put it out there (great idea at the time, but in hindsight we probably should’ve taken a different approach). Chris asked for something, we figured out how, and did it.</p>

<p>Sorry for the digression, back to what I was saying about 2003: Chris and I wrote a short paper describing a vision for Amazon infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and relied extensively on web services for things like storage. We drew on the work of a number of other folks internally who had been thinking and writing (and sometimes even coding) in the storage services space, and we combined it with our own thinking and experience in infrastructure. Near the end of it, we mentioned the possibility of selling virtual servers as a service.</p>

<p>We presented the paper to Bezos (he doesn’t do slides), he liked a lot of it, and we went back to work.</p>

<p>A few months later, in early 2004, I was told Jeff was interested in the virtual server as a service idea and asked for a more detailed write up of it. This I did, also incorporating a couple of requests Jeff had, like the idea of a “universe” of virtuals, which I translated into network-speak as a distributed firewall to isolate groups of servers. This first cut at it looked almost nothing like the production EC2 service, and, in my view, every change made by the team who built EC2 was for the better. As just one example, that first paper called for a system manifest from which a server would be built. This is similar to how much systems automation works, but is actually terrible for the sort of dynamism desired for EC2.</p>

<p>After presenting the “executive brief” paper to Jeff, the realities of turning this hare-brained scheme into a real service meant involving the smartest folks around (i.e., not me). In the Amazon style of “starting from the customer and working backwards”, we produced a “press release” and a FAQ to further detail the how and why of what would become EC2. At this point attention turned from these paper pushing exercises to specifics of getting it built. Most importantly, who would lead the effort?</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to leap at once to the same conclusion: Pinkham. And so it was that Pinkham returned to South Africa, taking a stellar lead developer with him, and they built the EC2 team, then built EC2. That last part seems awfully compressed, doesn’t it? Well, that’s because I had almost no interaction with the EC2 team. They went off and kicked a lot of ass and the rest is history.</p>

<p>The end.</p>

<p>
In the early 1990s, when the internet was still in its structural infancy, and its influence on broader culture was widely underestimated if not entirely unknown, Howard Rheingold already knew enough to predict where this newest technology would — and wouldn’t — take us.
</p>
<p>
These lines from Rheingold’s nearly thirty-year-old book, The Virtual Community, have been on my mind for over a decade:
</p>
<blockquote>
“What does it mean that the same hopes, described in the same words, for a decentralization of power, a deeper and more widespread citizen involvement in matters of state, a great equalizer for ordinary citizens to counter the forces of central control, have been voiced in the popular press for two centuries in reference to steam, electricity, and television? We’ve had enough time to live with steam, electricity, and television to recognize that they did indeed change the world, and to recognize that the utopia of technological millenarians has not yet materialized. An entire worldview and sales job are packed into the word progress, which links the notion of improvement with the notion of innovation, highlights the benefits of innovation while hiding the toxic side-effects of extractive and lucrative technologies, and then sells more of it to people via television as a cure for the stress of living in a technology-dominated world. The hope that the next technology will solve the problems created by the way the last technology was used is a kind of millennial, even messianic, hope, apparently ever-latent in the breasts of the citizenry. The myth of technological progress emerged out of the same Age of Reason that gave us the myth of representative democracy, a new organizing vision that still works pretty well, despite the decline in vigor of the old democratic institutions. It’s hard to give up on one Enlightenment ideal while clinging to another.” — Howard Rheingold, <a href="http://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/" target="_blank">The Virtual Community</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
When I say I’ve been thinking about this passage for over a decade, I mean that literally. <a href="https://www.chrbutler.com/ethical-technology-3">Ten years ago</a>, I reflected upon how Rheingold’s perspective had aged after, then, almost two decades. What stood out to me in 2011 was his connection between progress and economics. I noted that ideas of progress are carried by economic activity, which means that ideas that don’t easily bind to wealth-building don’t easily bind to culture. Or in other words, capitalism promotes technological change more than technology changes capitalism. That is not a good thing. And, it was as true ten years ago as it is today.
</p>
<p>
What strikes me now is how that same idea plays out within a much more developed technological culture. In 1993, Rheingold’s assessment would have probably struck the average person as <i>academic</i>. Intellectually persuasive, perhaps, but not especially relevant to day-to-day life. After all, in the year Rheingold’s book was published, there were an estimated 15 million internet users <i>worldwide</i>. That was less than half of one percent of the world’s population. Back then, they measured internet usage by file requests — that alone tells you a lot. But to be specific, those file requests had increased to an average of 400,000 a month. Total. In case you’re not sure, that is not a big number by today’s standards. It’s tiny. Today, there’d be as much point in measuring the internet in file requests as there would be in measuring a life in blinks.
</p>
<p><span>
1993</span> also happened to be the same year that the New York Times published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/08/business/business-technology-a-free-and-simple-computer-link.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm" target="_blank">its very first story on the World Wide Web</a>! In it, Mitch Kapor (the creator of Lotus), offered this somewhat ironic quote: “For me Mosaic was a turning point. It’s like C-Span for everyone.” C-Span, of course, is “famous” for providing every American with unfettered access to governmental proceedings or, in other words, revealing how boring running a country can be.
</p>
<p>
That’s where Rheingold’s thirty-year-old assessment of the internet takes me now. We have gorged at the table of technology for long enough to be bored by even the notion of a new technological layer, but our addict’s muscle memory has us loading up our plates still. We understand the connection between technology and economy — now better than ever — and yet we see bizarre signs of dissonance everywhere. The person who virtue signals about one thing while keeping the other technological conveniences they enjoy — the ones that put neighbors out of work, fatten oligarchs, and erode meaningful boundaries throughout the world — very much in their blind spot. The person who rants about tearing down the system on a video recorded, processed, and uploaded to the system. The person who rebels against the government and shares the pictures of them doing it.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the tea party of 1773, where a hundred men dumped £9,659 worth of tea overnight so the city would wake up (literally) to see the symbol of their discontent floating in the harbor, 2021’s sedition was performed for a rapt audience in real time, with a tatooed QAnon shaman draped in animal pelts ransacking and shit-smearing the Capitol alongside wealthy Instagram influencers who flew in for the spree on their private jet. Whether they saw the rebellion as a historical act of defiance or just another batch of content for the feed is not so easy to parse. There is evidently a pretty wide and messy spectrum of participation, with those who drove in vans full of explosives, ready to zip-tie hostages and execute the Vice President on one end, and those who loitered nearby while flooding the internet with the same-old <span>MAGA</span> hat kissieface selfies on the other. And <i>somewhere</i> in there are the people who went to the trouble of printing up “Civil War” hoodies, the people who erected a massive cross and a gallows — a truly spectacular unforced error of irony — and sadly, the people who died in the brawl.
</p>
<p>
Who was rebelling and who was vlogging? Legally, it doesn’t really matter. They were one and the same this week. But when we place this moment within the longer narrative of culture, progress, and technology, I think it does and will matter quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
Rheingold lamented the common hope (“ever-latent in the breasts of the citizenry”) that technology will solve past problems without creating new ones. Of course it can’t do that. And in some respects, new problems signal progress as much as new solutions do. But when I re-read his words — “ever-latent in the breasts of the citizenry” — I think not of a hidden, concealed, existing-but-not-yet-manifest <i>hope</i>, but a hidden, concealed, existing-but-not-yet-manifest <i>reality</i> made possible by thirty years of the internet. And not just one latent reality, but as many of them as there are people who express them and agree. A clustering of <span>ID</span> and ego-born realities legitimized by the shine of a technological package and the easy endorsement of a like or share.
</p>
<p>
I wonder what sorts of defenses will be mounted in courts on behalf of the YouTubers, Twitchers, and Instagrammers who stormed the Capitol. Will it be that they didn’t know that what they were doing was wrong? That they didn’t know they were committing treason and not just creating content? Or will it be that they actually were not able to know the difference? As far-fetched as insanity pleas typically are, I wonder about future defenses that the increasing density of our filter bubbles may afford. Time will tell.
</p>
<p>
The internet has been the object of every kind of criticism and blame you can imagine. Certain corners of it more so than others. Sometimes the complaint has been that the technology gives voice to the profane. Sometimes it’s that the technology worsens inequality. Sometimes it’s our humanity we are worried about, and how using technology rewires our brains in the image of the machine. All these have had their time in the critical conversation. But what of the role technology has in simulating a reality within a reality? When it does this, it does it <i>invisibly</i> — wrapping itself around a person — without an edge or boundary that anyone can see or trace. These simulated realities create and shape minds just as the outer — the real — reality does.
</p>
<p>
It is often said that “there are two Americas,” a metaphor highlighting cultural and economic divides. But there aren’t just two Americas. There are thousands, if not millions, of Americas. Sorting the real from the simulated, the legitimate from the illegitimate, the American from the seditious, is, in theory, a job for a kind of technology. And yet, what strange, metastatic chaos future would such a technology create?

We now have a reality problem, created by a culture which has irrevocably fused with its technology. And just like any symbiosis, one cannot survive without the other.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I’m addicted to the internet. Mainly via my phone. A year ago I implemented a radical plan to try and stop my addiction. Here’s what I learned.</p><h3>My internet addiction</h3><p>Everybody has slightly different internet vices, mine are:</p><ul><li>Reddit</li><li>Youtube</li><li>Twitter</li><li>The News</li></ul><p>Thankfully, I don’t have a Facebook or Instagram problem currently.</p><p>A bit like many smokers, I wanted to quit, but quitting is hard. Owning a smartphone is like trying to quit smoking whilst carrying a packet of cigarettes in your pocket at all times.</p><p>For me the negative impacts of my addiction were:</p><ul><li>I picked up my phone and opened certain apps subconsciously (a sign of addiction).</li><li>I wasted a lot of time scrolling through unfulfilling content. This prevented me from doing the things I actually 'wanted' to do.</li><li>Some activities, especially reading the news and Twitter too often made me feel worse and fuel anxiety.</li></ul><p>My will power feels like a limited resource, and it felt exhausting to fight these addictions. I wanted to make a systematic change.</p><h3>The problem: Internet business models &amp; ‘The Feed’</h3><p>The underlying problem is that various internet businesses: Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, The News, etc. make money with advertising. To maximise revenue, they need your eyes to be looking at the screen so they can show you ads. The time you spend engaged in their App is proportional to how much money they make.</p><p>So like any good company should, they’ve set out to maximize engagement.</p><p>The problem here is that humans ultimately have monkey brains, and the company’s feed algorithms figured out that negative news, clickbait and cat videos are the things that keep us there.</p><p>Youtube doesn’t make more money by recommending only 1 hour of high quality content per week. They’ll show you the 1 hour, then it’s on to the unlimited cat videos!</p><p>The root cause of all of this is the ‘Feed’ and ‘Watch next’ recommendation engines that point you to the content to consume. We have little control over what they recommend and the frequency they update to show you new content to consume.</p><h3>Solution: Block/Limit the feeds, but not the content</h3><p>To try and help my addiction I took radical steps - I blocked and limited my access to feeds on my phone and laptop.</p><p>This involves blocking apps: Reddit, Youtube, Twitter… etc. so you can’t open them or they have short time limits.</p><p>It also involves blocking websites: <code>reddit.com</code>, <code>youtube.com</code>, <code>twitter.com</code>, etc. so that you can’t circumvent the controls using your web browser.</p><p>You should also block installing new Apps. Installing new Apps allows new vices to come in and might allow you to circumvent your blocks. This sounds quite radical, but in practice it’s turned out to be much less of a big deal than I’d have thought.</p><p>You should make it hard to circumvent your blocks, for me this involves creating a difficult to remember password which is as short as it can be e.g. ‘a1f3de7’ and giving it to my partner. If I want to circumvent my blocks I ask her for the password, which I’ll then later forget. I also don’t like asking her, which means that I don’t ask often.</p><p>However, if you block everything, you’re completely unable to engage with any content. If a friend recommends a video or sends a link to a news article, you can’t view it. In practice this is irritating and encourages you to disable your blocking, which leads to addiction lapses.</p><p>So allow individual pieces of content in the browser:</p><p>Continue to block Apps, block <code>twitter.com</code>, but allow <code>twitter.com/*/status/*</code>. So if someone sends you a tweet, you can open it. But, you can’t waste hours scrolling through your Twitter feed.</p><h3>How to implement the blocks</h3><p>Implementing these blocks isn’t straightforward. iOS is limited in its ability to allow wildcard urls, so I switched to Android (a pretty radical step, I know!). Hopefully Apple adds the capability to implement these kinds of blocks in future.</p><p>Android has multiple Apps which allow you to limit your access to Apps. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.dsimpletools.helpmefocus&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Help me Focus</a> is the one I landed on, although it’s a bit clunky.</p><p>I blocked all browsers except for Firefox and installed <a href="https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a> which supports deny and allow lists with wildcards.</p><p>Blocking on your laptop is straightforward. I use <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/">Cold Turkey</a> which supports blocking sites using deny / allow lists with wildcards, as well as applications.</p><p>I would recommend doing a dry run for a week where you can easily ‘break-glass’ and tweak your setup easily. Once you’re happy it’s working well, hand the nuclear launch codes to someone else.</p><p>If you’re interested in my setup: <a href="https://github.com/richardgill/block-your-feeds">here's the config I use</a>.</p><h3>How did it go?</h3><p>Pretty well. Until my addiction took over and I circumvented my own controls and slowly descended back into feed hell over the course of a year.</p><p>I’ve now doubled down, even more radically, to stop myself from easily circumventing the controls.</p><p>When it’s working I notice:</p><ul><li>I feel happier and less anxious.</li><li>I get more stuff I ‘want to do’ done.</li><li>Time limiting some feeds works well. For example: Time limiting Reddit forces me to effectively ration my usage to 30 minutes per day.</li><li>Boredom - I struggle to fill the time the feeds took up.</li></ul><p>I’d recommend lining up some activities (or projects) so that you don’t lose your mind in week one.</p><p>Sometimes I do feel like I’m missing out on good content. Some of this content is brilliant, so going completely cold turkey seems like a shame, but without control of your feeds, it’s hard to consume in moderation.</p><p>I wish there was a place I could go which gave me ‘Slow feeds’ which only recommended the best content that day or week, instead of a never ending feed of cat videos. An example of a slower feed (which I still allow) is: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">news.ycombinator.com/best</a> which shows you the most upvoted Hacker News posts in the past couple of days.</p><p>Blocking feeds is a promising strategy, the tooling to implement it could be much better, today it’s only possible for power users.</p><hr><h3>Appendix: Circumventing your blocks <!-- -->*<!-- -->spoilers<!-- -->*</h3><p>If you implement feed blocking, you’re entering an arms race with yourself to circumvent the blocks. Here are some of the pitfalls and how I solved them.</p><p>*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Spoilers below: This section might help you circumvent your own blocks, read on at your own risk. If you never think of these workarounds, you’ll never have to solve them!<!-- -->*<!-- -->*</p><h4>Installing new Apps which aren’t blocked:</h4><p>I blocked the Play Store App so I can’t install new Apps. Easy! Then I figured out you can install apps via the <code>play.google.com</code> on the web. Then on a bad day I installed Brave Browser, then I used that browser for 6 months to browse Twitter. So now I’ve blocked: <code>play.google.com/store/apps/details*</code></p><h4>Youtube is hard to block:</h4><p>I limit the Youtube feed to 30 minutes a day. I've figured out that I can easily bypass this, by scrolling the feed finding videos I want to watch. Google for the titles of the videos and watch them in the browser. This means 30 minutes of feed scrolling Youtube is a lot! Because Youtube content is videos it’s really hard to stop abuse.</p><p>Also, chromecasting Youtube videos is not tracked.</p></section></div>]]>

				<p>We cycled the Swiss part of the Rhine Cycleway last week, with our <a href="https://www.bikefriday.com/bicycles/touring/1248">folding</a> <a href="http://airnimal.eu/products/chameleon/performance-sport/">bikes</a> neatly stowed in suitcases for the flight. A combination of <em><a href="http://cycle.travel/">cycle.travel</a></em> (natch), the Cicerone guide, and the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mapout/id477094081?l=en&amp;mt=8">MapOut</a> app guided us safely along the way: a very modern combination of mapping styles.</p><p>Wandering around Zürich, waiting for our flight home, I was intrigued by this cycle map in the window of a (closed) antiquarian bookstore:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_1.jpg"></p><p>And if that isn’t clear enough from the pic snatched through a window, here’s a better excerpt from <a href="http://www.ak-ansichtskarten.de/shop/ak/46/back4684588/Rueckseite-Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-fuer-Radfahrer-Strassburg-und-Umgebung-Naumann-s-Fahrraeder-Seidel-Naumann-Dresden.jpg">an example</a> I found online:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_2.jpg"></p><p>On major climbs, rather than strictly following the two-dimensional curves of the route as a conventional map would do, the map shows a miniature gradient profile for that particular hill.</p><p>Bending geometry to show a subjective view of space is nothing unusual. The Tube map (and its many imitators) famously do it, as do the one-dimensional strip maps that Laurence Penney has <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/blog/misc/one-dimensional-maps/">lovingly curated</a>&nbsp;(and, indeed, one of Laurence’s maps has a <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/one-dimensional-maps-14.jpg">passing resemblance</a> to these German sheets). But I’ve never seen quite this approach taken before. It’s a recognition that – just as distance is immaterial to the Tube passenger – to the cyclist, hills are as much part of the ‘distance travelled’ as are the ticking miles on the cycle computer.</p><p>Not that the Radfahrer in question would have had cycle computers, of course. There appear to have been 80 of these sheets, published by&nbsp;Mittelbach's Verlag of Leipzig with the co-operation and support of the national German cycling organisations <em>(unter Mitwirkung der Gauverbände des Deutschen Radfahrerbundes und der Konsulate der Allgemeinen Radfahrer-Union)</em>. They seem to date from the beginning of the 20th century, and are not yet collectable, if the <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-Radfahrer-Mitwirkung-Gauverb%C3%A4nde-Deutschen/6461038791/bd">prices on Abebooks</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>And in one of those curious coincidences…</p><p>I originally finished this post with “<span>I don’t expect to see a revival any day soon”, but the day after I posted this, Sustrans Midlands retweeted a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/Lunto_Sustrans/status/496934542880833536">exactly such a map</a>. This ‘Accessible Map’ of Queenstown, New Zealand, was particularly intended for wheelchair users and other people who find steep slopes challenging:</span></p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/modern_elevation_map.jpg"></p><p><span>You can download the full map as a PDF from drcqueenstown.co.nz. The cartographer, Toby Eglesfield, has also written an <a href="http://www.tobyeglesfield.com/a-map-showing-the-steepness-of-streets/">extensive, well-illustrated blog post</a> explaining the design choices he made – and&nbsp;in the comments, two people raise the idea of generating such a map from OpenStreetMap data.

    <div>
      <p>Without further ado, I present: a basic whitted ray tracer, complete with multicore rendering, written in 100% pure CMake. If you don't care about the details, and just want to see the code, you can <a href="https://github.com/64/cmake-raytracer">find it here</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://github.com/64/cmake-raytracer/raw/master/render.png">
    <figcaption><i>Rendered in 7m23s on a i5-10210U, 8 processes</i> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At this point, those familiar with CMake may have some questions, so keep reading to find out how it all works.</p>

<p><strong>Good news:</strong> CMake has a <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/math.html?highlight=math"><code>math</code></a> command. <strong>Bad news:</strong> it only supports integers. If you've written a ray tracer before, you probably did it with floating point numbers. So how do you go from representing signed integers to representing something-resembling-floating-point numbers? One answer is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic"><strong>fixed-point arithmetic</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea with fixed point is simple. We define some large integer to represent the number 1.0; let's choose <strong>1000</strong>. Then we can represent 2.0 as 2000, 0.5 as 500, -3.0 as -3000 etc. When we want to add two numbers, we simply add their fixed-point representations. Here's how that looks in CMake:</p>
<pre><span>function(add a b res)
    math(EXPR tmp </span><span>"(${</span><span>a</span><span>}) + (${</span><span>b</span><span>})"</span><span>)
    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" "${</span><span>tmp</span><span>}" </span><span>PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()
</span></pre>
<p>This takes two values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to be added and stored in the variable <code>res</code>. I use <code>PARENT_SCOPE</code> so that the variable we create is actually visible from the calling function, otherwise CMake will destroy it when the function ends.</p>
<p>To multiply two numbers, we simply multiply their fixed-point representations, and then divide by the thing we chose to represent 1.0:
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4.0</mn><mo>↦</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1500</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4000</mn></mrow><mn>1000</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>6000</mn><mo>↦</mo><mn>6.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5 \times 4.0 \mapsto \frac{1500 \times 4000}{1000} = 6000 \mapsto 6.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Division is similar:
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>4.0</mn><mo>↦</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1500</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1000</mn></mrow><mn>4000</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>375</mn><mo>↦</mo><mn>0.375</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5 \div 4.0 \mapsto \frac{1500 \times 1000}{4000} = 375 \mapsto 0.375</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
We could have multiplied by 1000 after doing the division, but as integer division rounds towards zero this would wipe out all our precision (as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1500</mn><mn>4000</mn></mfrac><mo>×</mo><mn>1000</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1000</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1500}{4000}\times 1000 = 0 \times 1000 = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>). Multiplying first gives us better results, as long as the dividend isn't too huge (which would cause overflow).</p>
<p>CMake's <code>math</code> command only supports basic integer arithmetic. For more complicated operations, like square root, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton-Raphson iteration</a>. You can read more about this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method">here</a>, but the basic idea is to make a 'guess' as to what the output should be then iteratively refine the guess towards the answer. This gives a surprisingly accurate result within only three or four iterations, subject to the quality of the initial guess:</p>
<pre><span>function(sqrt x res)
    div_by_2(${x} guess)

    </span><span>foreach</span><span>(counter RANGE 4)
        </span><span>if</span><span>(${guess} EQUAL 0)
            set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" </span><span>0 PARENT_SCOPE)
            return()
        </span><span>endif</span><span>()

        div(${x} ${guess} tmp)
        add(${tmp} ${guess} tmp)
        div_by_2(${tmp} guess)
    </span><span>endforeach</span><span>()

    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" "${</span><span>guess</span><span>}" </span><span>PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()

</span><span># sqrt(123) = 11.09072626, actual answer is 11.0905365064
</span></pre>
<p>I also implemented a similar function for computing <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msqrt><mi>x</mi></msqrt></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> separately as I found that it lead to better numerical stability, as opposed to computing the square root as above and then doing the reciprocal. This comes in handy when we need to normalize vectors.</p>
<p>Almost everything in computer graphics is done with vectors, so I started implementing vector operations: <code>vec3_add</code>, <code>vec3_mul</code>, <code>vec3_div</code>, <code>vec3_dot</code> etc. These make use of CMake built-in lists, which are pretty horrible, but save me from having to use three separate variables to keep track of the individual components of each vector. For example, here's what the dot product looks like:</p>
<pre><span>function(vec3_dot x y res)
    list(GET ${x} 0 x_0)
    list(GET ${x} 1 x_1)
    list(GET ${x} 2 x_2)
    list(GET ${y} 0 y_0)
    list(GET ${y} 1 y_1)
    list(GET ${y} 2 y_2)
    mul(${x_0} ${y_0} z_0)
    mul(${x_1} ${y_1} z_1)
    mul(${x_2} ${y_2} z_2)
    add(${z_0} ${z_1} tmp)
    add(${tmp} ${z_2} tmp)
    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" </span><span>${tmp} PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()
</span></pre>
<p>And here's how we'd use it to normalize a vector:</p>
<pre><span>function(vec3_normalize x res)
    vec3_dot(${x} ${x} x_2)
    rsqrt(${x_2} one_over_length)
    vec3_mulf(${x} ${one_over_length} tmp)
    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" </span><span>${tmp} PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()
</span></pre>
<p>As well a few other bits and bobs, like <code>clamp</code> and <code>truncate</code>, that's all the arithmetic that's needed.</p>

<p>If you're new to ray tracing, I'd refer you to <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_shirley">Peter Shirley's</a> wonderful book series '<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>', which my code is loosely based on. The general intuition is to trace rays out from the camera into the scene and see what they intersect. Since we represent all our scene geometry and rays as mathematical objects, computing intersections between rays and geometry is just a case of solving equations. Once we have found an intersection, we compute the color of the point we intersected with, which may itself be computed by tracing rays towards light sources or towards other scene geometry.</p>

</figure> 
<p>To keep it simply I went with a simple scene consisting of a sphere sitting atop an infinite plane in a checkerboard color. I also ended up faking the shadow underneath the sphere, simply drawing a black circle (well done if you spotted it from the image). I had implemented whitted ray tracing and even path tracing at one point, but they were much more complicated and performed a lot worse for the same result. In theory, though, there's no reason why I couldn't do it properly, it would just require some additional effort and patience.</p>
<p>Here's what the main 'trace' function looks like, with some of the unnecessary bits stripped out for clarity:</p>
<pre><span># Traces a ray into the scene, computes the color returned along the ray
</span><span>function(trace ray_origin ray_dir depth color)
    </span><span># Base case for recursion
    </span><span>if</span><span>(${depth} GREATER_EQUAL 3)
        return()
    </span><span>else</span><span>()
        math(EXPR depth </span><span>"${</span><span>depth</span><span>} + 1"</span><span>)
    </span><span>endif</span><span>()

    </span><span># Calculate intersection points with the sphere and plane
    </span><span>sphere_intersect(${ray_origin} ${ray_dir} hit_t_1 hit_point_1 hit_normal_1)
    plane_intersect(${ray_origin} ${ray_dir} hit_t_2 hit_point_2 hit_normal_2)

    </span><span># Did we hit the sphere?
    </span><span>if</span><span>(${hit_t_1} GREATER ${ray_epsilon})
        </span><span># Calculate reflected ray direction
        </span><span>offset_origin(hit_point_1 hit_normal_1 new_origin)
        vec3_dot(hit_normal_1 ${ray_dir} scalar)
        mul_by_2(${scalar} scalar)
        vec3_mulf(hit_normal_1 ${scalar} refl_a)
        vec3_sub(${ray_dir} refl_a new_dir)

        </span><span># Recursively trace the new ray into the scene
        </span><span>trace(new_origin new_dir ${depth} traced_col)

        </span><span># Calculate contribution from lights
        </span><span>set(col 0 0 0)
        light_contrib(hit_point_1 hit_normal_1 light1_pos light1_col out_col1)
        light_contrib(hit_point_1 hit_normal_1 light2_pos light2_col out_col2)
        vec3_add(col out_col1 col)
        vec3_add(col out_col2 col)
        vec3_add(col traced_col col)

        set(base_col ${sphere_color})
        vec3_mul(base_col col col)

    </span><span># Did we hit the plane?
    </span><span>elseif</span><span>(${hit_t_2} GREATER ${ray_epsilon})
        </span><span># ...snip: Use equation of a circle to fake shadow, if we're within range

<p>When I started, I wouldn't sure if it would be possible to do in pure CMake, but with a little trickery we can manage it.</p>
<p>For <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> processes, the basic plan is to divide up the image vertically and let each sub-process render a few rows. We can invoke sub-processes with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/execute_process.html"><code>execute_process</code></a> command, passing arguments (such as the worker index) via <code>-D</code>. Each process then spits their row data into a text file, which gets merged together by the master process once they've all finished.</p>
<p>One subtlety is that as we need all the sub-processes to run in parallel, we can't simply call <code>execute_process</code> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> times, as it would run them sequentially. Luckily, we can specify multiple processes to run simultaneously in one command (I think this is intended to be used for long chains where one program is piped into the next), but in order to avoid hardcoding <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we have to programmatically construct the call to <code>execute_process</code> with CMake's <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/command/cmake_language.html"><code>EVAL CODE</code></a> feature (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/martty/vuk">martty</a> for this idea):</p>
<pre><span>message(STATUS </span><span>"Launching ray tracer with ${</span><span>num_procs</span><span>} processes, ${</span><span>image_width</span><span>}x${</span><span>image_height</span><span>} image..."</span><span>)

set(exec_command </span><span>"execute_process(</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)
</span><span>foreach</span><span>(worker_index RANGE 1 ${num_procs})
    set(exec_command </span><span>"${</span><span>exec_command</span><span>}COMMAND cmake . -Wno-dev -Dworker_index=${</span><span>worker_index</span><span>} -Dimage_width=${</span><span>image_width</span><span>} -Dimage_height=${</span><span>image_height</span><span>} -Dnum_procs=${</span><span>num_procs</span><span>}</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)
</span><span>endforeach</span><span>()

</span><span># Begin the worker processes
</span><span>cmake_language(EVAL CODE ${exec_command})

message(STATUS </span><span>"Finished ray tracing, gathering results..."</span><span>)
</span></pre>
<p>As per <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>, I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example">PPM image format</a>. This is a really simple text-based format which is perfect for my purposes as I don't have to bother with compression. Once we're done rendering we simply read all the data that the workers have spat out, write the PPM header, and print everything to <code>stderr</code>:</p>
<pre><span>set(image_contents </span><span>"P3 ${</span><span>image_width</span><span>} ${</span><span>image_height</span><span>}</span><span>\n</span><span>255</span><span>\n\n</span><span>"</span><span>)

</span><span>foreach</span><span>(worker_index RANGE 1 ${num_procs})
    file(READ </span><span>"worker-${</span><span>worker_index</span><span>}.txt" </span><span>file_contents)
    set(image_contents </span><span>"${</span><span>image_contents</span><span>}${</span><span>file_contents</span><span>}"</span><span>)
</span><span>endforeach</span><span>()

message(</span><span>"${</span><span>image_contents</span><span>}"</span><span>)
</span></pre>
<p>The division of work among the worker processes is pretty sub-optimal as the rows towards the top of the image are mostly empty whereas the rows at the bottom are entirely full, which means that some processes finish very fast while others take much longer. Fixing this problem is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>In 2015, a subreddit called /r/The_Donald was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and widely been regarded as a bad move.</p>



<p>Roughly 5 years after its inception, the Reddit staff banned /r/The_Donald because it was a cesspool of hateful content and harmful conspiracy theories. You can learn more about it <a href="https://www.vikingsecblog.com/dumping-the-donald/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Why are we talking about this in 2021?</h2>



<p>Well, <em>a lot has happened</em> in the first week of the new year. A lot of words have been written about the fascist insurrection that attempted a coup on the U.S. legislature, so I won’t belabor the point more than I have to.</p>



<p>But as it turns out: The shitty people who ran /r/The_Donald didn’t leave well enough alone when they got shit-canned.</p>

<p>Instead, they spun up a Reddit clone under the domain <code>thedonald.win</code> and hid it behind CloudFlare.</p>



<p>Even worse: Without Reddit rules to keep them in check, they’ve gone all in on political violence and terrorism.</p>



<p>(<strong>Content Warning</strong>: Fascism, political violence, and a myriad of other nastiness in the Twitter thread below.)</p>

<p>If you remember last year, I published a blog post about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/09/how-to-de-anonymize-scam-knock-off-sites-hiding-behind-cloudflare/">identifying the real server IP address from email headers</a>. This is far from a sophisticated technique, but if simple solutions work, why not use them?</p>



<p>(Related, I wrote a post in 2020 about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/12/deplatforming-hate-and-harassment/">more effectively deplatforming hate and harassment</a>. This knowledge will come in handy if you find yourself needing to stop the spread of political violence, but is strictly speaking not relevant to the techniques discussed on this page.)</p>



<h2 id="unmasking-thedonald.win">Unmasking TheDonald.win</h2>



<p>The technique I outlined in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/09/how-to-de-anonymize-scam-knock-off-sites-hiding-behind-cloudflare/">my previous post</a> doesn’t work on their Reddit clone software: Although it asks you for an (optional) email address at the time of account registration, it never actually emails you, and there is no account recovery feature (a.k.a. “I forgot my password”).</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1388" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-12/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-12.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-12" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-12.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-12.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-12.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-12.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-12.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-12.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Foiled immediately!

<p><strong>However, their software is still a Reddit clone!</strong></p>



<p>Reddit has this feature where you can submit links and it will helpfully fetch the page title for you. It looks like this:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2387" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/2021/01/09/masks-off-for-thedonald-win/reddit-post/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/reddit-post.png" data-orig-size="566,655" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="reddit-post" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/reddit-post.png?w=259" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/reddit-post.png?w=566" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/reddit-post.png?w=566" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/reddit-post.png 566w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/reddit-post.png?w=130 130w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/reddit-post.png?w=259 259w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px"><figcaption>When I paste a URL into this form, it automatically fetches the title.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>How this feature works is simple: They initiate an HTTP request server-side to fetch the web page, parse out the title tag, and return it.</p>



<p>So what happens if you control the server that their request is being routed to, and provide a unique URL?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2389" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/thedonald-access-logs/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png" data-orig-size="1044,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="thedonald-access-logs" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png?w=1024 1024w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png?w=300 300w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png?w=768 768w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-access-logs.png 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Leaking TheDonald.win’s true IP address from behind CloudFlare.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Well, that was easy! To eliminate false positives, I performed all of this sampling with Tor Browser and manually rebuilt the Tor Circuit multiple times, and always got the same IP address: <strong><code>167.114.145.140</code></strong>.</p>



<h4>An Even Lazier Technique</h4>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=thedonald.win">Just use Shodan</a>, lol</strong></p>

<h3>The Road to Accountability</h3>



<p>Okay, so we have their real IP address. What can we do with it?</p>



<p>The easiest thing to do is find out who’s hosting their servers, with a simple WHOIS lookup on their IP address.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2403" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/2021/01/09/masks-off-for-thedonald-win/thedonald-whois/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-whois.png" data-orig-size="468,229" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="thedonald-whois" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-whois.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-whois.png?w=468" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-whois.png?w=468" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-whois.png 468w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-whois.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/thedonald-whois.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></figure></div>



<p>Hosted by OVH Canada, eh? After all, nothing screams “Proud American” like hosting your website with a French company in a Canadian datacenter.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1389" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-13/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-13" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Dunking on these fools for the inconsistencies in their worldview is self-care and I recommend it, even though I know they don’t care one iota about hypocrisy.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I immediately wondered if their ISP was aware they were hosting right-wing terrorists, so I filed an innocent <a href="https://www.ovh.com/world/abuse/">abuse report</a> with details about how I obtained their IP address and the kind of behavior they’re engaging in. Canada’s laws about hate speech and inciting violence are <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/your-ward-news-james-sears-sentenced-1.5256452">comparably strict</a>, after all.</p>



<p>I’ll update this post later if OVH decides to take action.</p>



<h2>Lessons to Learn</h2>



<p>First, don’t tolerate violent political extremists, or you’ll end up with political violence on your hands. <strong><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjbp9d/do-social-media-bans-work">Deplatforming works</a>.</strong></p>

</div><figcaption>It’s catchy!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Second, and most important: Online privacy is hard. Hard enough that bigots, terrorists, and seditious insurrectionists can’t do it right.</p>



<p>This bears emphasizing: None of the techniques I’ve shared on the history of my blog are particularly clever or novel. But they work extremely well, and they’re useful for exposing shitty people.</p>



<p>Remember: Sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p>



<p>Conversely: Basic OSINT isn’t hard; merely tedious.</p>



<h3>Other Techniques (from Twitter)</h3>

<p>If the site in question is running WordPress, you <a href="https://blog.nem.ec/2020/01/22/discover-cloudflare-wordpress-ip/">can use Pingbacks to get WordPress to cough up the server IP address</a>. If you aren’t sure if something runs WordPress, here’s the lazy way to detect that: view any page’s source code and see if the string <code>/wp-content</code> shows up in any URLs (especially for CSS). If it’s found, you’re probably dealing with WordPress.</p>

<h2 id="noticed">The Alt-Right Notices this Blog Post</h2>



<p>Shortly after I posted this online, some users from thedonald.win noticed this blog post and hilarity ensued.</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The <a href="https://twitter.com/SoatokDhole/status/1348204577154326528">entire Twitter thread</a> is worth a read.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I want to make something clear in case anyone (especially members of toxic Trump-supporting communities) is confused:</p>



<p>What’s published on this page <em>isn’t</em> doxing, nor do I have any interest in doxing people. That’s the job of law enforcement, not furry bloggers who sometimes write about computer topics. And law enforcement definitely doesn’t need my help: When you create an account, you must solve a ReCAPTCHA challenge, which sends an HTTP request directly to Google servers–which means law enforcement could just subpoena Google for the IP address of the server, even if the above leaks were all patched.</p>



<p>This also isn’t the sort of thing I’d ever <em>brag</em> about, since the entire point I’ve been making is <strong>what I’ve done here isn’t technically challenging</strong>. If I wanted to /flex, I’d just talk more about my work on <a href="https://github.com/soatok/constant-time-js">constant-time algorithm implementations</a>.</p>



<p>If, in response to my abuse report, OVH Canada determines that their website isn’t violating OVH’s terms of service, then y’all have nothing to worry about.</p>



<p>But given the amount of rampant hate speech being hosted in Canadian jurisdiction, I wouldn’t make that bet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">
  <article>
    
     
      
    <p>This isn’t a theoretical piece about freedom and digital technologies. This is a real ongoing trend that is at best observed around secure messaging application Signal by Open Whisper Systems and it’s founder Moxie Merlinspike. His view and management of Signal reflects a wider trend that jepordises world’s freedom.</p>
<p>Signal is a secure messaging software that has changed the field a lot. Signal is built upon propriety software Textsecure and RedPhone applications that had been developed by Merlinspike and his co-founder Stuart Anderson. When Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, it releases both software under free software licenses. Merlinspike left Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, founded Open Whisper Systems and merged -once the private property of himself- TextSecure and Redphone into Signal.</p>
<p>Signal is free software. “Free as in freedom”, their client and server code is licenced under GPLv3 and AGPLv3. This makes the code and only the code itself pro-freedom. Just because the code it self free does not necessarily make the coder “free” as well and that is the problem we face today!</p>
<p>Open Whisper Systems led by Moxie Merlinspike, who is behind Signal, is and was never behind freedom. This has been seen in the light of LibreSignal (<a href="https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165">https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165</a>) debate where a fork of Signal client is build without unfree dependencies and published on the F-droid free software repository on Android. After much debate about federation, the claimed server resources and freedom, followed by legal trademark threats Libresignal has been removed from F-droid and so was anybody’s chance of using Signal as a secure messenger who doesn’t use Google services. <a href="https://wire.com/en/blog/axolotl-proteus-encryption-protocols/">Wire</a> case is just another example.</p>
<p>This approach is not only a threat to free software it is a recurring threat to human kind!</p>
<p>To prove this bold claim one needs to look at one recent blog post from Open Whisper Systems and a presentation made in 36C3 by Merlinspike.</p>
<p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">Signal’s blog post</a>
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">Matrix’s blog Post</a></p>
<p>The main points of his claims can be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to build</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to evolve</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to secure</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are becoming concentrated in predominant provider anyways</li>
<li>If users don’t trust their app provider they have the freedom to use something else</li>
</ul>
<p>While his claims are true up to a certain point they are only superficial. Through these points Merlinspike claims that, centralized services are superior in modern times!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">anyone who is interested in the depth of this debate can start reading Martix’s answer to Merlinspike at the link here</a></p>
<p>It is really unnecessary to explain in depth why this type of thinking is dangerous when a simple change in words can tell more than 1000 page work. Let’s rename the object and compare his digital dystopia with one that has occured several times through-out analog human history and which once again recures today;</p>
<ul>
<li>Democracies are harder to build</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to improve</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to secure</li>
<li>In democracies power is becoming concentrated in predominant hands anyways</li>
<li>If people do not like their democracy provider (country) they have the freedom to leave and go another provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>One doesn’t need to think hard to see what Merlinspike is advising. He claims democracies suck because of the hardships of human organization and proposes autocracy to manage the world in favour of the helpless people occupying it. Why? Because democracies are inefficient and people don’t want that!</p>
<p>If he had given the same statement about democracies and governmental politics as he gave about federative systems it would have provoked outrage! People died for freedom, they are still dying and struggling around the globe. Then someone comes and stomps over every ideal which human society ever build up until this point in history and proclaims themselves the world leader! Think about it!</p>
<p>The example given is bad but why are Merlinspike’s claims about decentralized systems not considered bad as well? Because digital freedom has not yet been lost and won by blood or are we still asleep? Just because code is free, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the coders mind is also free! Freedom is not just a license, it is an ideal in any condition that we must stand for!</p>

Yet many in the public dread a nuclear accident or a terrorist attack on a reactor. How serious are these dangers?</p><p>First, some good news: A nuclear explosion using a power plant is impossible. The fuel is not enriched nearly enough to produce the required energy. The accidents at <a href="https://www.nei.org/resources/fact-sheets/chernobyl-accident-and-its-consequences">Chernobyl</a> in 1986 and <a href="https://www.nei.org/resources/fact-sheets/comparing-fukushima-and-chernobyl">Fukushima</a> in 2011 were not nuclear blasts, but chemical fires or explosions caused by steam or hydrogen gas. The risk in an accident comes from direct radiation and radioactive fallout. Let’s look at those separately.</p><p><strong>Direct Radiation</strong></p><p>Several hundred nuclear reactors exist for research and medical purposes, as well as 440 commercial power reactors and an untold number powering ships. All emit radiation, but shielding protects the tens of thousands of people who work around those reactors. Years after Fukushima, the Japanese government had attributed only one death to radiation. The only certain cases of serious radiation poisoning from a reactor were in the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear accident in history. But those Soviet reactors were badly designed, shoddily built, lacked proper safety shielding, and the operators did everything wrong. The steam explosion ejected huge quantities of radioactive material into the atmosphere, yet the only deaths from <em>direct</em> radiation were about <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-was-the-death-toll-from-chernobyl-and-fukushima">60 people</a> working at the site. Modern designs are far safer. Even with poor design and no shielding, direct radiation from a disaster would only affect those very near (i.e. plant workers). The reason is that radiation loses potency by the square of the distance it travels: The intensity at 200 yards is one-quarter of that at 100 yards. In short, direct radiation is not a serious hazard beyond the reactor proper. An explosion at a chemical factory or a fire at an oil refinery is a vastly greater danger.</p><p><strong>Indirect Radiation (radioactive fallout)</strong></p><p>Chernobyl spewed massive quantities of radioactive particles into the air, and the wind carried those particles over much of Europe. Although most of the radiation from that fallout was at levels below natural background radiation, some predicted up to a million deaths from cancers. Nearly 35 years later, we know that no such tragedy came to pass. The percentage increase of fallout-induced cancers has been so small that there is no clear, measurable increase in cancer rates with one <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rpd/article/182/1/58/5076213">exception</a>, treatable thyroid cases. Studies show about 20,000 such cases in Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Russia, caused by iodine-deficient children drinking milk contaminated with radioactive iodine. Most of these cases could have been prevented had the Soviets distributed iodine tablets. For perspective, these health effects are orders of magnitude less than the harm from the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-12-03/28356">Bhopal</a> chemical leak of 1984, which killed at least 18,000 people and permanently disabled an additional 50,000. The groundwater in the area is still undrinkable today.</p><p><strong>The Terrorism Threat </strong></p><p>So far as we know, there have been no successful terrorist attacks on any of the world’s thousand or so reactors. This is probably for good reason. While they could knock one offline or force a shutdown, all that would do is shut off power. It would be much easier to attack a conventional or renewable power system. </p><p>Terrorists might attempt to provoke a meltdown, but would need incredible skills to achieve this. And the worst that would happen to a modern water-cooled reactor would be another Fukushima. Another famous case, Three Mile Island—the Pennsylvania accident in 1979 that terrified the American public—has been studied intensely, finding <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html#effects">no observable health effects</a>. </p><p>A further common fear is that terrorists could steal radioactive material. In a power reactor, the radioactive material is the fuel rods. Could these make a dirty bomb to spread radioactive fallout? Not really. The cost and effort would be prohibitive. Fuel rods, especially spent ones, are so hot that direct radiation would kill anyone who came close. They cannot be safely removed from their non-portable protections except by equipment that is big, cumbersome and expensive. Terrorists could more easily deploy chemical or biological agents. </p><p>Finally, could spent rods be used to make an atomic bomb? It would be almost impossibly difficult. The technical and physical difficulty of extracting plutonium from spent rods requires the resources of a good-sized country. In the 1940s and early ’50s, the United States did use spent fuel as a source for bomb material. But it required such massive equipment and cost that the government soon switched to other sources. North Korea made bomb material without a power reactor, and Iran chose direct enrichment rather than trying to use its nuclear power plant. </p><p>So even if terrorists somehow did get control of a nuclear power plant, there is no opportunity to cause widespread harm. Modern plants are even designed to sustain an airplane crash without causing harm beyond the plant itself. </p><p><strong>The next generation of advanced reactors </strong>due out later this decade will have even fewer vulnerabilities than today’s pressurized water-cooled reactors. Almost all advanced designs use no water and are “walk-away-safe,” which means that no operator or mechanical intervention is necessary to ensure safety. The physics of the fuel automatically stop the reaction if it gets too hot, and most designs cannot create radioactive fallout. </p><p>Even better, some small designs operate automatically, requiring no operator: They can be buried in the ground and just hum along generating energy for 10, 20 years or more.&nbsp;Advanced reactors promise an almost unlimited availability of clean heat and power, inherently safe, dispersible, and reliable 24/7, regardless of the weather.</p><p>Some environmental campaigners still insist on a decades-old horror of reactors that traces back to a justified hatred of nuclear bombs. But that has never been warranted for energy plants. If they—and all of us—are to find a way out of our climate crisis, we must recognize that we already have a large part of the solution. </p><p><strong>W. D. Budinger, who studied at Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Lab, is an inventor with three dozen patents. He spent more than 30 years as chief executive of Rodel Inc., a global manufacturer of semiconductor materials. </strong></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!--timestamp:1609873743-->

<p><img src="https://jam1.re/img/arc-diagram-smoking.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ok so long-time followers of mine might catch it, but the title is in reference to a 2018 blog post of mine: "<a href="https://jam1.re/blog/injecting-files-into-an-archive-format-i-dont-understand">Injecting Files Into an Archive Format I Don’t Understand</a>". It's one of the posts I'm more proud of, so I'd definitely recommend checking it out, especially if you're interested in file format reverse engineering, or just an "explain it like I'm 5" of the reverse engineering mindset. However, it has been quite a long time since 2018, so I think it's time for an update.</p>
<p>TLDR on the last post in the series: Smash Ultimate has a single massive archive containing its assets called "data.arc", I figured out how to inject mods into the game without really understanding the format with some corner-cutting trickery.</p>
<h2>Quick Smash Modding Catchup</h2>
<p>So a lot of relevant stuff has changed since my last blog post in the world of Smash Ultimate modding since my last blog post in this series.</p>
<p>Quick rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game released. Since uh. It hadn't been by the time I was the first to get mods running in-game, as seen in the last post.</li>
<li>The game has received 9 major updates, the first of which massively overhauled the archive format. (As well as 6 minor versions and quite a few patch versions)</li>
<li>Multiple arc-related tools have been released:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ploaj/ArcCross">CrossArc</a> - "A quick and dirty file extractor for Smash Ultimate's ARC file"</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ploaj/ArcCross">ArcCross</a> - A library formed from ripping the parsing code out of CrossArc during a refactor.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jam1garner/arc-fuse">fuse-arc</a> - A FUSE filesystem for data.arc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple means of modding files have been released at various points:
<ul>
<li>After my blog post, I made a simple python script for injecting files automatically</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NyxTheShield/SSBU-Mod-Installer">SSBU Mod Installer</a> - My script was ported to PyNX (A python interpreter homebrew for the Switch)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BenHall-7/ArcInstaller">ArcInstaller</a> - An ArcCross-based solution for mod injection</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jam1garner/saltynx-arc-mod-installer">saltynx-arc-mod-installer</a>, a mod which installed your mods when you booted the game. (Note: I have no memory of writing this or it existing but I'm told it was popular? At least for a short period of time)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ultimate-research/UltimateModManager">Ultimate Mod Manager (UMM)</a> - A homebrew application based on saltynx-arc-mod-installer that was basically all around better</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/raytwo/arcropolis">ARCropolis</a> - A Skyline mod written in Rust designed for adding native mod loading support to Smash Ultimate, created by Raytwo from a proof of concept of mine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most notable of them is Arcropolis which, unlike the rest of the mod loading techniques, functions by modifying the resource loading system directly as opposed to modifying the archive on disk.</p>
<h2>How the Archive Format <em>Actually</em> Works</h2>
<p>There has been a lot of benefit to having so many eyes on the arc works, it's a complicated format and I certainly wouldn't have bothered to put in the hours it'd take to reverse all this by myself. All of this has been a collaborative work from the start—people like Ploaj, Shadow, and ShinyQuagsire also played a large role at various points in this endeavor. Credit where credit is due—largely not with me. I have largely seen my efforts towards this as being in the engineering, documentation, and guidance departments.</p>
<p>However let's get into the meat of this: the format itself. First, at the top level we have the ARC file:</p>
<img src="https://jam1.re/img/arc-diagram-overview.png" alt="">
<p>It's comprised of a header and ~3 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream Data Section - This is immediately after the header (by convention, could be anywhere) and stores all the "stream" (audio, video) files which, due to being dependent on 3rd party code must be uncompressed (the Switch multimedia subsdk only takes a file path and an offset into the file)</li>
<li>File Data Section - This section contains the contents of basically all the files in the game. Despite a vast majority of the files here being compressed it is by far the largest section.
<ul>
<li>There is sort of a subsection, the "shared files", where files which are (again, by convention) sharing a backing data source, have their contents stored. It only <em>really</em> exists in the ARC header, which gives an absolute location of where shared files start</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The "Compressed Table" - The actual filesystem data, all in one big (well, relatively small) Zstandard-compressed block</li>
<li>The Patch Section - An unused section of the ARC which we only know about from reverse engineering the resource system. Originally this was intended to function similarly to Smash for Wii U and 3ds' "DTLS" system ("dt" being the "data" files, and "ls" being the listing files), which allowed storing patch data in an additional archive which is then merged into the contents of the base game.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you never look at the compressed table, it's actually a rather simple format! A few offsets in a header that point to a bunch of data. However, this is where things start to get messy.</p>
<p>Once decompressed the filesystem looks something like this extremely simplified diagram:</p>
<img src="https://jam1.re/img/arc-diagram-filesystem.png">
<p>So first off, it should be noted that everything in this part of the format is <strong>sequential</strong>, meaning the only way to know where a piece of data is is by knowing where the data before it ends. This means that in order to do much of anything, you must parse the entire table before you can do anything. Functionally, this comes in the form of the entire filesystem table being just a bunch of counts followed by an array of structures of that count. So when you see "stream directories" above, it actually involves a count in the "stream header" followed a bit later by an array of bit packed structs representing the directories:</p>

<p>The <code>index</code> and <code>count</code> are then used to form a range within the stream entries comprised of all the files contained in the directory. The <code>hash</code> (a crc32) and the <code>name_length</code> comprise a "Hash40", which is used as a unique identifier throughout the arc and other parts of the game (for basically all of them, the unhashed string is not present in the game, requiring a massive hash cracking effort by the community).</p>
<p>An overview of the contents of the filesystem table and how it's used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream-related:
<ul>
<li>Stream Data Array - describes ranges within the steam data section in which individual files are located</li>
<li>Stream Data LUT (Not Pictured) - a lookup table to get the index into the Stream Data Array</li>
<li>Stream Entries - describes individual files, composed of an absolute path hash, some flags, and an index into the Stream Data LUT to get the stream data</li>
<li>Stream</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-stream:
<ul>
<li>File Data Array - describes ranges within the file data section and shared data section (the offsets are relative to the start of the file data section for both) as well as whether or not the file is compressed (in older versions of the format, these also described the type of compression)</li>
<li>File Data Hashmap - a map of file path hashes to indexes into the file info array</li>
<li>File Path Array - an array of paths to a file. A path is composed of 4 hashes: the full path, the extension, the parent directory, and the file name within the directory</li>
<li>File Info Array - the core representation of a file. It contains an index into the file path array and an index into the file data hashmap, as well as flags related to the file (is it localized, does it redirect to another file, etc.)</li>
<li>File Hashmap - a map of the file path hash to an index into the file path array</li>
<li>File Info Search Buckets - binary search buckets for the file hashmap</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why the Archive Format is so Complicated</h2>
<p>This might seem overcomplicated but let's think about some of the goals/constraints of this system:</p>
<ol>
<li>The game will always be stored on flash memory</li>
</ol>
<p>You might be asking: well why would the storage medium affect the file format? The reasoning for that is actually rather simple. If you have either a hard drive or a disk drive, reading a file from disk involves moving the head to the right part of the disk and then pulling the data from that portion of the disk. Now compare that to (a simplification of) flash memory: you request a read at an arbitrary location over the address bus, then a specific flash chip is selected from the chip-select portion of the address, then it uses the rest of the address to select what data within the chip to return over the data bus.</p>
<p>Now let's put that in the context of how it affects our file format: with a game that might be stored on disk, we have to consider the fact that seeks have a cost to them: physically moving the head of the hard drive. This means sequential reads are significantly cheaper, so you want to avoid jumping around to different parts of the file when possible. This can be mitigated to an extent by effective caching either in hardware or by the filesystem driver, however the effects will still be noticable. This means if quick load times are more important than disk space, you might want to store multiple copies of the same data, as you can then store those copies beside other data that will be needed around the same time.</p>
<p>How this effects Smash becomes pretty clear when you look at character skins: each character has 8, and for a majority of skins they are just simple recolors, meaning models/boneset/rigging/normal maps/etc. will likely be identical between skins. So not having to consider a hard drive or disk drive a possibility means that the best option is to save space by de-duplication strategies such as the "shared file" system. If you look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=630">transition between PS4 Spiderman and PS5 Spiderman, you see the same strategies present</a>, for the same reasons: both the Switch and the PS5 are the first console generation for both game series in which the only storage medium is flash. In the case of Spiderman, as <a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1328831734310338560">noted by its technical director</a>, it has the paradoxical effect of a larger and more detailed game taking up less disk space.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The game has a lot of files, but most files are either always loaded together or directly looked up by absolute path (or something similar, like a folder + filename pair, which is effectively an absolute path)</li>
</ol>
<p>This leads to a bit of a tricky situation where, without optimization, you'll spend a significant amount of time just searching for the file before you can even load its contents. To get around this Smash Ultimate uses the file info search buckets in order to quickly speed things up. What it does is split …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, Uwe Friedrichsen asked a pretty good question <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/the-broken-promise-of-re-use/">on his blog</a>:</p><blockquote><em>"...Re-use is the holy grail of IT: whenever a new architectural paradigm comes to IT town, 're-use' is one of the core arguments why to go for that paradigm. The business sales pitch typically goes like this: 'Switching to &nbsp;will cost some money upfront but due to the re-use it enables it will soon pay back'...In short words: re-use based on any architectural paradigm never worked as promised, the promise was always broken..."</em></blockquote><p>He offers up CORBA, Component-based architectures, EJB, SOA -- then asks if microservices will be any different. Why is the promise of re-use broken? Why can't we create truly reusable code?</p><p>These are great examples, and Friedrichsen does a pretty good job of going over his version of why reuse sucks so bad. You should read his essay. I believe, however, he misses the key point: <strong>classic OO and pure functional programming lead to vastly-different endgames when it comes to reusability because they're based on different assumptions</strong>.</p><p>Let's perform an experiment. Holding everything else the same, let's implement the game "FizzBuzz" in idiomatic pure FP and OO using F# and C#. That's about as small a code example as I can come up with. First, the F#:</p><pre><code>let (|DivisibleBy|_|) by n = if n%by=0 then Some DivisibleBy else None
let findMatch = function
  | DivisibleBy 3 &amp; DivisibleBy 5 -&gt; "FizzBuzz"
  | DivisibleBy 3 -&gt; "Fizz"
  | DivisibleBy 5 -&gt; "Buzz"
  | _ -&gt; ""
[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
let main argv =
    [1..100] |&gt; Seq.map findMatch |&gt; Seq.iteri (printfn "%i %s")
    0 // we're good. Return 0 to indicate success back to OS</code></pre><p>Looks like about a dozen lines of code. Notice these three things:</p><ul><li>It's all in "pieces". Nothing is connected to anything. There's a weird thing called DivisibleBy, then there's a chunk of stuff that looks like the main FizzBuzz program. But it's not called from there. Instead, there's this third chunk -- the only "real" line of code, which only one line. If you didn't know any better, you wouldn't know what chunk went with what.</li><li>At the end of the FizzBuzz game, we usually ask, "What if there is yet another rule?" In this case, it's obvious from the code that you'd just add something to those DivisibleBy lines in the second chunk. Nothing else would change.</li><li>Once the pieces are in-place, it looks much more fluid as to how the final line would work. If you're a functional programmer, you realize that the final chunk is really up to the programmer. Here I've done it "point-free"[1], which is just piping things from one place to another. But I could have done it several other ways. It really doesn't "do anything" aside from evaluate the sequence and print it. How I choose to do that is up to me. I make various choices in order to minimize my cognitive load.</li></ul><p>As an example, for that final line, I might go:</p><pre><code>let fizzBuzz n  = n |&gt; Seq.map findMatch |&gt; Seq.iteri (printfn "%i %s")
    fizzBuzz [1..100]</code></pre><p>In that case, I've collapsed everything down to one token, "fizzBuzz" that handles everything but the range of numbers. This allows me to change it up.</p><pre><code>fizzBuzz [50..200]</code></pre><p><em>I know this sounds trivial but it's not</em>. I made the decisions around the tokens based on anticipated usage in my project. I have wide freedom to join things up -- or not. There is a skill to make tokens that come together in a "mini-language" to solve the type of problem in front of me. I don't write the solution; I write the pieces I then can assemble together in various ways to make the solution.</p><p>Now let's look at the C# code.</p><pre><code>// from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz
namespace oop
{
    class Program
    {
        static void DoFizzBuzz1()
        {
            for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++)
            {
                bool fizz = i % 3 == 0;
                bool buzz = i % 5 == 0;
                if (fizz &amp;&amp; buzz)
                    Console.WriteLine (i.ToString() + " FizzBuzz");
                else if (fizz)
                    Console.WriteLine (i.ToString() + " Fizz");
                else if (buzz)
                    Console.WriteLine (i.ToString() + " Buzz");
                else
                    Console.WriteLine (i);
            }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            DoFizzBuzz1();
        }
    }
}</code></pre><p>For the F# code, I mashed up some code I found on the net. For the C# code, I went to SO and found the top answer to the "How to do FizzBuzz" question. That's the fairest way I know how to handle this.</p><p>The C# code is about three times longer. Here's what stands out:</p><ul><li>It's all in a fixed structure. There's a namespace. There's a class. There's a method. Everything has a place and is part of everything else. Things are where they are for a reason.</li><li>Looking at the structure, it feels like adding new rules makes things more complex. I'm pretty sure a new rule would involve a new line after those two "bool" lines with fizz and buzz in them, but then we get into that nested if/else-if/else-if/else structure and something's going to have to change there. Very easy to do, of course My feeling is that adding new rules makes things more complex, where with FP we reached a complexity peak and then it was easy. You might phrase that as "with FP we started off generic" On the SO page there was another C# example that offered generic rules, but the other commenters said -- and I agree -- that it looked overly complex. Frankly it looked like a lot of FP crammed into an OOP app. But it was more generic. It's just not the code you'd most likely end up with as a C# programmer. (Remember that code-is-code, and you can just about do anything with anything. The issue today is why coding on average in one paradigm turns out differently than coding on average in another one, not what's possible or what you can or can't do.)</li><li>It looks much more capable in regards to components and reusability. This is where things get odd. Technically, the C# code <em>should be</em> better at components. We have a namespace. That prevents components from getting mixed up. We have a class, "Program", that allows us encapsulation and data hiding for our work, preventing consumers from having to worry about how we do things. I've made the method static, but even if we leave it static, an object wrapper clarifies that "DoFizzBuzz1" is <em>this particular version</em>, perhaps not the same one as one offered by "Program2" -- or Program with perhaps a different constructor. If nothing else, in OO things have the appearance of being especially constructed for reuse.</li></ul><p>In the C# code, I'm not managing tokens to create a mini-language, I'm managing structure to keep my code organized. Things go into certain places in OOP, and we have rules to explain when and where they're supposed to go. It's an organization system.</p><p>So on the surface, the C# code should be much better set up to be a reusable component. It's better-organized, after all.</p><p>Only one way to check that. Let's build a component.</p><p>Can I drop the C# code into another container, say something to render HTML from a server to a client?</p><p>Well, not so much. Everything is stuck in the Main method, and <em>the Main method is coupled to the DoFizzBuzz1 method</em>. In addition, the range, 1 to 100, is coupled to the implementation. The class is the way it is because it's coupled to being a C# console app. Most of the difference you see in line count between the two is because the C# app is a template. Everything is stuck together in a tightly-coupled, rigid, yet oddly mutable structure.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11xLxy-VVSA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Code walkthrough. At the end I get a bit mixed up about components and reuse. The topic here is general reuse. Building components to fit into sockets is another situation with its own problems.</p><p>None of that is right or wrong, but we run into three or four problems trying to reuse 30 lines of C# that just gets worse the more code we have: <em>everything is coupled to everything else and mutability makes the linkages impossible to separate</em>. In fact, because objects are both data and code, <strong>that's by design</strong>. It's supposed to work that way!</p><blockquote><em>[Ed]: Another way of phrasing the thesis in this essay is that in FP, you should naturally be scoped by what the code does. That scoping is airtight. In OO, you should naturally be scoped by a bunch of terms you use to group your code in. There are thousands of different ways to think of those terms and what might belong inside or outside of code grouped using them.</em></blockquote><p>We'd probably want an "HtmlProgram" class instead of a Program class. Maybe we'd want an HtmlRenderer class because, dang it, that Html stuff has to go somewhere. FizzBuzz factory? <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">Enterprise FizzBuzz</a>, anyone?</p><p>How about the F# code? Sure. I've got one line of code in main that I'd need to put somewhere else. Everything else is in the global namespace. Using my second example, if I need to change the range, it's easy -- not coupled to anything. <strong>In pure FP everything is loosely-coupled until the last responsible moment</strong>. Remember, I could juggle those tokens around any way I want right up until that last line. I have wide latitude. OO, on the other hand, requires us to commit to a design early on, as soon as we have enough code and data that indicate it. Otherwise, there's no point in using OO.</p><p>It's important to note that this isn't a C#-bashing essay. One of these isn't better or worse than the other one. They simply solve problems in vastly different ways. The OO code scales up to large, monolithic apps where everything has a place. The FP code scales <em>out</em> to tokens that create a DSL that callers can use to do whatever they want using a new language. In OO, I end up with a big honking chunk of data and code that's guaranteed to do exactly what I need (because of testing). In FP, I end up with a new language that I am responsible for to use to create whatever I like (and test as I go.)</p><p>But when the endgame is reuse, say in microservices, the two paradigms lead to drastically different answers. The pure FP …</p></div></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/semver-snares"><em>(Part of an ongoing series!)</em></a></p>
<p>In Rust, changes to a type's size are not usually understood to be Breaking Changes™. Of course, that isn't to say you <em>can't</em> break safe downstream code by changing the size of a type...</p>
<h2 id="sizedness">Sizedness</h2>
<p>For one, you can change the <em>sizedness</em> of a type, by adding an unsized field:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub mod </span><span>upstream {
  #[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)]
  </span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>,
    </span><span>// uncommenting this field is a breaking change:
    /* baz: [u8] */
  </span><span>}
}

</span><span>pub mod </span><span>downstream {
  </span><span>use super</span><span>::upstream::</span><span>*</span><span>;

  </span><span>fn </span><span>example</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>: Foo) {
    todo!()
  }
}
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>error<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/error-index.html#E0277" target="_blank">[E0277]</a>: the size for values of type `[u8]` cannot be known at compilation time</span>
  <a href="#" data-line="11" data-col="14">--&gt; src/lib.rs:11:14
</a>   |
11 |   fn example(foo: Foo) {
   |              ^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
   |
   = <span>help: within `upstream::Foo`, the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `[u8]`
</span><span>   = note: required because it appears within the type `upstream::Foo`</span>
<span>help: function arguments must have a statically known size, borrowed types always have a known size
</span>   |
11 |   fn example(&amp;foo: Foo) {
   |              ^
</code></pre>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>
<p>Changing the size of a <code>Sized</code> type can also break (poorly-behaving) downstream code. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/mem/fn.size_of.html"><code>mem::size_of</code></a> intrinsic is a safe function that provides the size (in bytes) of any <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Sized.html"><code>Sized</code></a> type. By convention, downstream code should not rely on <code>mem::size_of</code> producing a SemVer stable result, but that's only a convention. Consider:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub mod </span><span>upstream {
  #[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)]
  </span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>,
    </span><span>// uncommenting this field is a breaking change for `downstream`:
    /* baz: u8 */
  </span><span>}
}

</span><span>pub mod </span><span>downstream {
  </span><span>use super</span><span>::upstream::</span><span>*</span><span>;
  
  </span><span>const </span><span>_</span><span>: [(); </span><span>1</span><span>] </span><span>= </span><span>[(); std::mem::size_of::&lt;Foo&gt;()];
}
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>error<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/error-index.html#E0308" target="_blank">[E0308]</a>: mismatched types</span>
  <a href="#" data-line="12" data-col="22">--&gt; src/lib.rs:12:22
</a>   |
12 |   const _: [(); 1] = [(); std::mem::size_of::&lt;Foo&gt;()];
   |                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected an array with a fixed size of 1 element, found one with 2 elements
</code></pre>
<h2 id="zero-sizedness"><em>Zero</em> Sizedness</h2>
<p>A downstream crate author doesn't <em>only</em> need to worry that they aren't using <code>mem::size_of</code> in a manner that breaks the stability contract of upstream code. As of 2018, there's another mechanism that observes the size of a type: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.26.2/unstable-book/language-features/repr-transparent.html"><code>#[repr(transparent)]</code></a>.</p>
<p>The <code>repr(transparent)</code> attribute can be applied to types with at most one non-zero-sized field to specify that the annotated type's layout is identical to that of the field. Applying <code>repr(transparent)</code> to a type with more than one non-zero-sized field is a compiler error:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>,
    </span><span>baz</span><span>: </span><span>u8
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>error<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/error-index.html#E0690" target="_blank">[E0690]</a>: transparent struct needs exactly one non-zero-sized field, but has 2</span>
 <a href="#" data-line="2" data-col="1">--&gt; src/lib.rs:2:1
</a>  |
2 | pub struct Foo {
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ needs exactly one non-zero-sized field, but has 2
3 |     bar: u8,
  |     ------- this field is non-zero-sized
4 |     baz: u8
  |     ------- this field is non-zero-sized
</code></pre>
<p>Consequently, upstream changes that turn ZSTs into non-ZSTs can break downstream code.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub mod </span><span>upstream {
  #[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)]
  </span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: (),
    </span><span>// uncommenting this field is a breaking change for `downstream`:
    /* baz: u8, */
  </span><span>}
}

</span><span>pub mod </span><span>downstream {
  </span><span>use super</span><span>::upstream::</span><span>*</span><span>;

  #[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
  </span><span>struct </span><span>Bar(</span><span>u8</span><span>, Foo);
}
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>error<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/error-index.html#E0690" target="_blank">[E0690]</a>: transparent struct needs exactly one non-zero-sized field, but has 2</span>
  <a href="#" data-line="12" data-col="3">--&gt; src/lib.rs:12:3
</a>   |
12 |   struct Bar(u8, Foo);
   |   ^^^^^^^^^^^--^^---^^
   |   |          |   |
   |   |          |   this field is non-zero-sized
   |   |          this field is non-zero-sized
   |   needs exactly one non-zero-sized field, but has 2
</code></pre>
<p>You should therefore avoid <code>#[repr(transparent)]</code> unless the ZST field types are <em>documented</em> to remain ZSTs.</p>

<p>Pantheon is a website platform optimized and configured to run high performance sites and then ransom those sites back to their customers when traffic rises due to popularity. This fork is intended to empower Pantheon <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/announcements/im-back/" rel="nofollow">customers stuck with a ransom note</a> to self-host instead.</p>

<p>As you can see you need to give up some things in order to migrate to Kubernetes. What you lose you gain back in the form of control. Items may be added to or removed from the stack as needed.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-1-spin-up-a-free-site-on-pantheon">1. Spin-up a free site on Pantheon</h3>
<p>If you do not yet have a Pantheon account, you can create one for free. Once you've verified your email address, you will be able to add sites from your dashboard. Choose "WordPress" to use the upstream distribution of this fork.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-2-load-up-the-site">2. Load up the site</h3>
<p>When the spin-up process is complete, you will be redirected to the site's dashboard. Click on the link under the site's name to access the Dev environment.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-3-run-the-wordpress-installer">3. Run the WordPress installer</h3>
<p>How about the WordPress database config screen? No need to worry about database connection information as that is taken care of in the background. The only step that you need to complete is the site information and the installation process will be complete.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-4-wait-for-ransom-note">4. Wait for ransom note</h3>
<p>Pantheon has a tendency to change their pricing model every couple of years. When you eventually get a ransom note after getting backed into a corner begin your migration to Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-5-begin-migration-to-kubernetes">5. Begin migration to Kubernetes</h3>
<p>The entire migration process should take about a week or so for an experienced developer. Full migration instructions <a href="https://habd.as/post/move-pantheon-wordpress-site-kubernetes/" rel="nofollow">are available</a> without fee.</p>

<h2>Deep neck flexor exercises</h2>
<br>
<h3>Why train them?</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_1.jpg"></p><p>The deep neck flexor muscles sit deep in the front of the neck, behind the trachea (windpipe). Because of their close proximity to the vertebrae (spine) and their short length, they have an important role in providing stability to the neck. People with a history of neck or upper back injury, such as whiplash, can show great improvement in pain and function if they strengthen these muscles. Those with postural neck pain often have weakness in these muscles and overuse in the muscles on the top of the shoulders. They too can show a great response to retraining the deep neck flexor muscle group.
</p><br>

<h3>How do I exercise them?</h3>
<h5>Exercise 1</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_2.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Lie on your back with knees comfortably bent. Find your neutral spine position, as explained by your physiotherapist. Use a small rolled towel under the head if needed.</li>
<li>Lift your head off the towel and feel the muscles on the front of the neck. These are NOT the deep neck flexor muscles - these muscles often overwork to try and help with stability, they are not designed for this purpose.</li>
<li>Perform a small nodding movement, as if to look towards your toes. Don't lift your head up. You should not feel the muscles on the front of the neck moving, but rather you should be using the muscles deep behind them.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 2</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_3.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Position as above.</li>
<li>Place your hand on the side of your head and provide gentle resistance, as if you are bending your head to one side.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
<li>Use hand to resist small rotation movement.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 3</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_4.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Lie on your tummy with hands supporting the forehead.</li>
<li>Perform the small nodding movement and float the head and breastbone off the floor.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 4a:</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_5.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Stand with your back to the wall and your feet slightly in front, hip width apart. Perform the small nodding movement, while sliding the base of the skull up the wall. You should feel the neck lengthen.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 4b:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Same as exercise above.</li>
<li>From the lengthened position, move your head away from the wall so that you're looking at the floor.</li>
<li>Then return to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do not allow your chin to poke forward through either movement.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Exercise 4c:</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_8.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Sitting in a chair, look up at the ceiling.</li>
<li>When returning the head back to the neutral position, do not let the chin poke forward.</li>
<li>Curl forward one level at a time, starting from the top.</li>
<li>Do not allow your chin to poke forward.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Where do I go from here?</h3>
<p>
Once you have mastered these exercises, you should feel more aware of your neck posture and how to position yourself correctly. You can use this knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>When sitting at your desk/computer or on the couch.</li>
<li>Performing any weights in the gym or doing exercise classes.</li>
</ul>

January 9, 2021 | https://serhack.me/articles/how-to-write-technical-book/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serhack.me/articles/how-to-write-technical-book/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/headline.jpg" alt="The 4 steps to write a technical book"></p><p>For some people, publishing a book represents a dream, or lifelong goal, whereby they share a particular experience or subject matter expertise.</p><p>In narrative books, behind every story, there is a moral that is often hidden and not always easy to understand. With more “technical” books, it is different ― as it goes beyond simply sharing. More specifically, writing a technical book means being a point of reference with regard to a particular topic. When diving into a technical book, your reader will likely want to explore the “What if…” and “How do you…” questions.</p><p>Let’s start at the beginning. Sharing a product you have spent time, energy, and money on is rewarding. At least for me, it was! In December 2018, I published my first technical book (and definitely not my last) titled <a href="https://masteringmonero.com/">Mastering Monero</a> through <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Amazon Self Publishing</a> and alongside a <a href="https://masteringmonero.com/#credits">team of great people</a>. It was exciting to receive early feedback from readers who praised both the content and writing style.</p><p>On the other hand, it was an intense and difficult journey. Writing a book is not easy and takes time ― a lot of time. I spent many days (and even some nights) imagining, refining, and rewriting the content without the help of a publishing house. Along with all this, I had to think about other aspects, such as marketing.</p><p>In an effort to help aspiring writers, I thought it might help to write an article with some essential tips for your journey. By following a few simple steps (some that were initially ignored by me), you will be able to enjoy a little more of the crazy adventure you are going to face: writing your first technical book!</p><p>In the following paragraphs, we will discuss:</p><ul><li>Choosing Your Idea: What Do You Want to Write About?</li><li>Selecting the Audience: How Do You Want to Write It?</li><li>Writing the Table of Contents or Outline</li><li>Contacting Potential Publishers</li></ul><h2 id="choosing-your-idea-what-do-you-want-to-write-about">Choosing Your Idea: What Do You Want to Write About?</h2><blockquote><p>“If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.” – Toni Morrison</p></blockquote><p>“I have an idea…I’m going to write a book about X.” If that is what you thought this morning after a delicious breakfast and/or good coffee, I will stop you there. Any content, especially a technical book, requires a degree of expertise on the topic being discussed.</p><p>When writing a technical book, not only will you be showing an in-depth knowledge on the topic(s) discussed, you will also need to be able to convey complex information in a way that is easy for your readers to understand. Being able to explain complicated topics in a way that even your grandparents can understand shows your mastery of the particular subject matter being discussed.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/1_idea.jpg" alt="Choosing Your Idea"></p><p>Writing about areas of focus that you know intimately ― after having spent weeks, months, or even years studying ― will make the writing process faster and easier, since you will not have to do as much research. In addition, your writing will present you as a subject matter expert.</p><p>In some instances, you will find that while explaining a topic, you may have to research the subject matter in a bit more detail. This supplemental research and its supporting material will be beneficial to expanding your own knowledge base and helping set a basic, foundational understanding for your reader.</p><p>When considering a topic to write about, ask yourself about other books related to your subject matter that might already exist. Also, you should ask yourself why you should be the person to write about this topic. These are important questions that you should consider at the onset of your adventure. You might be hesitant, but determination counts for a lot!</p><p>If you just want to write your “dream book” and commercial success is not a major concern to you, then go ahead and just write whatever you would like! There is nothing wrong with this approach. Many authors begin by writing about the topic(s) that interest them most. The experience of writing your first book is invaluable, whether you sell 10 copies or 1,000 copies!</p><h2 id="selecting-the-audience-how-do-you-want-to-write-it">Selecting the Audience: How Do You Want to Write It?</h2><p>Without an <strong>audience</strong>, you have no perspective on the problem your book is solving other than your own experience. It is true that you should always try to solve your own problems first, but to be successful, you have to solve other people’s problems in the process. If you are not solving someone’s problem with your book, they will not buy it.</p><p>Put more simply, you will not have anyone to sell your book to. Sure, you can put your book up for sale on your website or on Amazon. It might sell a few copies, but having an audience that you can identify is critical to the success of publishing a book.</p><p>You do not necessarily have to write for a large market ― your audience does not have to be in the millions to get a book deal. What matters is that there should be enough potential buyers to make the book profitable for you and the publisher.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/2_public.jpg" alt="Find the right audience"></p><p>It is important to keep in mind that the audience sets the method of communication through which you will share your experience and knowledge. Unless, as an example, you are a university professor with tenure, avoid creating a purely academic and theoretical book. Otherwise, you readers will freak out!</p><p>Remember that you are not a professor, so ignore the idea of writing something like a university textbook. Getting a textbook adopted for a course is a rarity. For a textbook, most publishers will not engage with you unless you are a professor or a researcher with a PhD who is an expert in a specific field.</p><p>In your writing, be sure to give practical examples with solutions. When considering computer scientists, researchers, and engineers, they are looking for current information and knowledge that can be applied now to solve problems. It is fine to include relevant theory in a book for this audience, but keep it short and simple. Remember: write content that someone can use immediately.</p><h2 id="writing-the-table-of-contents-or-outline">Writing the Table of Contents or Outline</h2><p>A good way to start writing content is to sketch out your book. Your proposal should include a summary paragraph of the content, a definition of your intended audience, a statement of need and potential, and a tentative outline of the chapter title.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/3_write.jpg" alt="Writing Outline"></p><p>This is what a potential editor wants to see. In addition to this, many will want to see the preface and a sample chapter just to assess your writing ability and style. The entire exercise will provide you with a proposal to solicit publishers, but it will also reinforce your ideas.</p><p>Another important tip: Do not reinvent the wheel. Find as many other books and articles on your topic as possible and generate a list of them. Be comprehensive and scroll through (if not completely read) all of these sources.</p><p>Make a list of things you do not explicitly want to cover and reference the list of things you do not like about other books. Avoid the urge to start writing about elements of a topic you initially think are interesting unless you believe them to be relevant to your project.</p><p>For example, if a book is about the Bootstrap framework, you might not need an introduction to the history of HTML or how DNS works. On the other hand, an introduction to CSS and style rules might be a good section to include in your book.</p><p>When you have completed enough research to develop your ideas, you can use an outline to develop a draft of your proposal. As you write and review, you will continue to fill in details, add transitions, and present your acquired understanding of the subject matter.</p><p>Once you have completed a draft, let it sit for a few days before reading it again. This simple trick gives you a more unbiased view of your writing, and you will likely discover gaps you initially overlooked and improvements to be made.</p><p>Keep in mind that this is an outline of work and not a contract. As you continue your research, you may decide to organize the final proposal differently and even eliminate some information and add new sections.</p><p>If you follow the traditional model of publishing a book (i.e. with a publishing house), this section is for you. Once you have a specific topic for a book and a decent amount of content, it is a good time to talk with a publisher.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/4_publish.jpg" alt="Publish your technical book"></p><p>Take a look at books on the market that are similar to what you are writing to find out the names of publishers interested in your topic. Then, go to their website and contact an editor at the publisher to get a book proposal form. Publishers generally ask the same questions, though in different order.</p><p>A good proposal generally includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Your idea</strong> ― Provide a brief overview of the subject matter and how you want to discuss it. Be sure to write a summary built on top with all the key chapters. As always, it does not matter if you change this later. This just helps make your idea more concrete for the people who will be reviewing it.</p></li><li><p><strong>The market</strong> ― You need to explain to them why your book is a good idea. Speculate a bit about the potential market and communicate why you are the best possible author to write the book. Your goal is to convince publishers about your idea! Including years of experience and some events that have shaped your career might help too!</p></li><li><p><strong>A writing example</strong> ― To write a book, you need to show the publisher that you can write properly. Since editors will base their opinion on your sample, avoid grammatical errors or simple typos. From your text, they should be able to tell how interested you are in potentially publishing a book with them!</p></li></ul><p>In addition to what you have included in your cover letter, most will want to know how you might market it (e.g., blogs, websites, radio). And by “How you might market it?”, I mean that it will primarily be up to you to promote your book.</p><p>Send your proposal along with a cover letter to potential publishers. There are many, especially small ones like <a href="https://oreilly.com/">O’Reilly</a>, <a href="https://nostarch.com/">NoStarch</a>, and <a href="https://packtpub.com/">Packt</a>. I will write an article later regarding the top publishers that I think have great potential.</p><p>When in communication with a publisher, <strong>never accept rejection</strong>. When faced with rejection, another secret is that it often has …</p></div></div>

January 9, 2021 | https://pan.earth/posts/why-i-am-janet.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pan.earth/posts/why-i-am-janet.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>In this installment I would like to show you in six cases, why is
<a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a> my programming language of choice.</p>
<h2>Case 1: Immutable or not</h2>
<p>I will start small: Janet has both mutable and immutable data structures for
all three usual suspects. So we have a buffer (mutable) and string (immutable),
also table (m) and struct (i), and indeed the array (m) and tuple (i). I
can understand the argument for immutable data, and respect it, but I love
the choice. Janet gives me that on every step, and yet guide me by its design.</p>
<h2>Case 2: Metal</h2>
<h3>C</h3>
<p>The fundamental property of the Janet language is the low-level nature of
the language implementation. C is the programming language used to implement
lots of parts; its parser, compiler, the virtual machine and a lot of the
functionality in the standard library.</p>
<p>This choice not only makes Janet fast and efficient, but it also brings
inspectability and transparency of the underlying mechanisms. Another benefit
is that there is the header file for the Janet C API, with which it is not
that hard to build your own C code or wrap some existing C code into your
library or embed Janet in other C program.</p>
<h3>Print</h3>
<p>In the spirit of the best Unix programs printing to the stdout is the
first-class citizen in the Janet language. For example, templating language
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~bakpakin/temple">Temple</a> by the creator of the language
just prints. In the
<a href="https://github.com/janet-lang/spork/blob/master/spork/fmt.janet">formatting part</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/janet-lang/spork">Spork</a>'s library base function
prints. The standard library has many functions for better work with the
printing, e.g. redirecting output.</p>
<h3>Threads</h3>
<p>The threads are also part of the core of the language. You can say what you
want when <a href="https://shouldiusethreads.com/">you should use the threads</a>
but sometimes it is very convenient to spin up threads for the hard
work. Especially if the threads are more similar to the erlang processes than
to the standard OS threads. Still, you have to use them safely, because of
the race conditions and locks.</p>
<h2>Case 3: OOP</h2>
<p>Now you have to think I have gone crazy. OOP in the functional language,
isn't it anti-pattern? I do not think so. Once I have been to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=uNPdZm5oF_E">talk</a> which
compared all three main paradigms. I took away that every paradigm has its
place and time for usage.</p>
<h3>Prototypes</h3>
<p>The OOP in Janet is the prototype-based one and backed by the table data
structure. You can easily set the prototype for the table with some properties
or behaviour, which is then inherited by your table.</p>
<h3>Messages</h3>
<p>The syntax for sending messages is easy. Call the keyword with the object
you are calling the message on as the first argument. This syntax is often
confusing for the people coming from the Clojure, because they can be used to
get the value from hashmap this way.</p>
<h3>Abstracts</h3>
<p>One exciting possibility emerging from this concept is that you can easily
teach messaging to your JanetAbstract objects written in the C language. Then
you have programs written in C looking just like ordinary Janet objects.</p>
<h2>Case 4: PEG</h2>
<p>As you may remember from the
<a href="https://pan.earth/posts/how-i-became-janet.html">How I became Janet</a>
post I was avid Rubyist. One of the quotes from Matz I like a lot is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are only three things certain in programmers life:
taxes, death and parsing text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this purpose, Janet uses
<a href="https://bakpakin.com/writing/how-janets-peg-works.html">PEG</a>. If you are
not sure, read the article to understand the concept better. With it, you
can create a small state machines, which can scan, parse and transform the
text into another form of the data.</p>
<h3>Oh so core</h3>
<p>What I love a lot about this particular implementation? That it is part of the
core of the language, again, you guessed, written in C. The PEG definition's
syntax is pure Janet code, very similar to how you write macros with all the
quoting, quasiquoting and unquoting. Its learning curve is steep, especially
if you strive for very optimal definitions, but once you get feel of it,
you will never look the same on a string of text. And you will finally
understand why you hated regex so much.</p>
<h3>Command and conquer</h3>
<p>One use case, where PEG shines for my particular interest is parsing the
interactive commands user input, mostly in TUI applications. I will discuss
this more in one later post, where I will write about my projects.</p>
<h2>Case 5: Dynamic</h2>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>The environment is just a Janet table, that holds all loaded bindings. The
one called root is used as a base, when you want to create a new one, for
example for the new fiber, you are creating, or when you are compiling your
code by hand.</p>
<h3>Modules and Loaders</h3>
<p>As is a custom in many languages, Janet has modules system to separate concerns
and divide code into smaller parts. By default, one source file maps to one
module and contains bindings and the environment. By importing a module, you
bring these to the current environment. But there are many other mechanisms,
how you can make this your own, some of them I will show in this part.</p>
<p>The loader is a mechanism that imports modules into the
environment. Interestingly, you can have loader not just for the Janet code,
image and native modules, but for whatever syntax. One lovely example is
the Temple library, which uses them to load your HTML (or any other) templates.</p>
<h3>Fibers</h3>
<p>The concept is very similar to the coroutines in other languages with one
caveat: it is also one of the base building blocks of the language and the
virtual machine. The fact also supports this: fiber contains a mechanism
for signalling, which helps differentiate the fiber's return, called
yielding. One of the usages touted by the language creator is capturing error
in the fiber's code, returned to the calling fiber. Yes, you are always in
the fiber, when you have Janet code running.</p>
<p>Right now the development version of the language contains generators,
based on fibers. Generators are similar to the Python ones, but due to the
status of the fibers as the first-class citizens of the language, they are
more natural in my view.</p>
<h3>ev</h3>
<p>Experimental and developing feature of the language added just in the latest
minor update, but great potential for the future. Maybe you already know what
it is: event loop in the core of the language! Just say how cool is that, and
with fibers as building blocks, it shines for anything async you throw at it
(if it does not block that is). Even as I am very excited about this feature,
I would rather wait for a little for it to mature and show all its facets.</p>
<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p>I know what you think; pepe just got out of ideas. No, I do not want to talk
about the fact, that Janet compiles the source code into virtual machine
bytecode, what I want to convey is that there is absolutely nothing wrong
for you as a programmer to grab some AST (probably provided by the language
parser) compile it and run compiled code. Or use some of the higher-level
mechanisms already present in the standard library as dofile or require.</p>
<p>I just used my minimal knowledge of programming language design to develop
Janet <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pepe/jlnt.kak">linter</a> for the Kakoune editor,
which probably is not the best linter around, but works great for me.</p>
<p>And not only code but even PEGs you can compile for faster and more efficient
run, when their time comes.</p>
<h3>Macros</h3>
<p>As any other Lisp, and many other languages Janet has macros. With all said
above, I am not afraid of writing them and even use them in a way, that will
up many brows, I fear. Yes, we can use macros! Deal with it.</p>
<h2>Case 6: Grab bag</h2>
<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>As you may understand now, tables are everywhere in the language OOP,
environment and other places, and frankly quite common in other langs. So? In
my opinion, Janet's ones are top-notch, similarly to fibers, because they
are the very basic building block of the language design.</p>
<h3>Repl keys</h3>
<p>Standard Janet repl has already coded a lot of shortcut keys for navigating
and modifying input text. One of the good outcomes of this feature is that
all those are also present in standard library getline function. But for me,
there are two I use a lot and refuse to switch to remote repl from the editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tab completes the binding you have started, even showing you the options,
when there are more than one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ctrl+g shows the documentation for binding
under the cursor! You may know that thought: is the separator first or the
last parameter to this fn?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And both are present when you use standard library getline; you provide the
table with bindings.</p>
<h3>Loop</h3>
<p>In the standard library, there is a macro loop, which is similar to those
in other Lisps. It also has sister macro seq, which gathers all the results
from all runs. I do not use it very often, but when I do, I praise it.</p>
<h2>To be continued ...</h2>
<p>That's all folks for this part. Next will be again little bit more
philosophical.</p>

The Ethereum system is not run by a company, but by a network of independent, private computers from around the world.

When somebody hits “Send,” the message goes from the sender to the Ethereum network and from there to the receiver. The best part is that your message is hidden from the network.</p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a5914269972fa0001f22fa4_E_9%2C1.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Even though Ethereum uses a global, public network of computers, only the sender and receiver can see their messages.

The two people sending messages would not notice any difference between the traditional, centralized apps and the new, decentralized apps. From their perspective, the Ethereum app works exactly like a traditional messaging app.</p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a5912cfa088d20001396b7d_E_9%2C2.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div data-animation="slide" data-hide-arrows="1" data-nav-spacing="4" data-duration="500" data-infinite="1"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Decentralized apps work automatically, without any middlemen, because they use Smart Contracts. </p><p>

Smart Contracts put agreed-upon rules into computer code and then enforce them automatically.
</p><p> 
They work like a vending machine, which is programmed to enforce rules automatically: You put in $0.50? <em>No soda.</em> You put in $1? <em>Soda</em>! You put in $1 but the soda is sold out? <em>Refund.</em></p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a591401a0d1730001b98a61_E_10%2C1.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>The best part is that after the rules are agreed upon, nobody can change or manipulate them – ensuring fairness to all parties. Smart Contracts automatically decide who gets paid under what conditions and how disputes are resolved. They run on their own!</p></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a5912e6825f170001a78bbf_E_10%2C2.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div data-animation="slide" data-hide-arrows="1" data-nav-spacing="4" data-duration="500" data-infinite="1"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Imagine tickets for a baseball game being sold using Ethereum Smart Contracts.
</p><p>
Since the contract is “smart” it can automatically act based on certain events. </p><p>For example, the Smart Contract could be connected to a weather app and be programmed to automatically issue refunds if it rains on game day. Pretty magical, isn’t it?</p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a5912efcd24e90001a0a282_E_11%2C1.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>What’s special about Smart Contracts is that none of the participants have to trust each other. </p><p>After the rules of a Smart Contract are agreed upon and the Contract is live, nobody can change those rules to cheat. The Smart Contract acts on its own and does exactly what it’s programmed to do, no matter what. For example, the stadium owner can’t change his mind and cancel the refunds.
</p><p>
Without interference being possible, all participants can trust the Smart Contract, even though they may not trust each other.</p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a5912f6a088d20001396b8d_E_11%2C2.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div data-animation="slide" data-hide-arrows="1" data-nav-spacing="4" data-duration="500" data-infinite="1"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Many Ethereum applications and Smart Contracts require an exchange of money. Because Ethereum is completely digital, it needs a built-in digital payment method to do that.
</p><p> 
In the Ethereum system, all payments are made using its own digital currency, called Ether.</p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a591303cd24e90001a0a28d_E_12%2C1.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Here is how the Ethereum platform and Ether currency work together: Every time money is transferred by an Ethereum Smart Contract, Ether is used for that transaction.</p><p>Unlike traditional currencies like the U.S. Dollar, Ether is 100% digital. Because of that, it can be “stored” directly in the Smart Contract’s code. This makes it possible for the Smart Contract to automatically send and receive money.</p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59446f92d4c908089df22b0f/5a59130a9972fa0001f22e4d_E_12%2C2.svg" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>In addition to Smart Contracts, Ether is also used to pay all the volunteers who help to run the decentralized Ethereum system with their computers.

<p>Recently I sold my old MacBook Pro, and until I buy myself a new laptop, I had to log in to my gmail account from a windows laptop.</p>
<p>So when I tried to login, Google flagged my attempt as an unknown device and wanted me to prove my identity.</p>
<p>I thought they would ask for the two factor authentication code by sending it to my mobile phone. However, the only two options they provided was to enter a code using the Google authenticator app, or accept a notification sent to my android device.</p>
<p>I haven’t used my android phone for a good six month, it got bricked, and since then I’m using an Apple device. I was unable to comply with both options provided by Google.</p>
<p><strong>I was at risk of getting locked out of my account.</strong></p>
<p>Lucky for my I was able to reset my password, provided some details, answer security questions, and reset my Google password.</p>
<p>However, what if I got locked out of my account? I could have lost access to almost all the services I have signed up for.</p>
<p>What if Google decided to delete or suspend my account? This has happened before, even popular YouTube content creators got their Google accounts deleted, or suspended.</p>
<h2>Why should get a personal email <strong>add</strong>ress</h2>
<p>I maybe exaggerating, but I believe that everyone should have their personal email address.</p>
<p><strong>By personal email address I mean not using the generic <em>@gmail</em> or <em>@ymail </em>email address etc, but instead using an <em>@yourdomain </em>email address.</strong></p>
<p>This looks professional, and you are not at risk of losing your access to services you signed up when you get locked out of your gmail account.</p>
<h3>Buy a domain name</h3>
<p>Buy a domain name, there are lot of domain name providers out there, find the best place to buy a domain name and purchase a domain name that suites your identity.</p>
<h3>If you have a hosting <strong>plan</strong> </h3>
<p>If you you are someone with a hosting plan, create an email account from your cPanel, and add email forwarding to your gmail account.</p>
<p>If you buy your domain name from Google, you can also forward emails to your gmail address for free. (But since we are talking about not getting locked out of your Google account, this maybe the worst best option)</p>
<h2>Use an <strong>email</strong> hosting service</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a hosting plan, you can use something like Zoho mail which provides free email accounts for your domain without the need of a hosting plan. </p>
<p>Namecheap also has an email hosting service for starting $0.75 per month.</p>
<p>Whatever you chose, it’s always better to have a personal email address and a domain name for yourself.</p>
<p>Even if you lose access to your gmail account, you can easily change the forwarding address to a different email address and receive emails and avoid getting locked out of important services you signed up.</p>
<p>I’m currently setting up a personal email address for myself. Let’s see how things work out.</p>

<p>The Over:Board is an IO board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. It is designed to use a standard PC ATX power connector and features a full size PCI-E 16x slot although its only running at 1x bandwidth and unfortunately it is not compatible with a GPU.   <br></p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://c0.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_fill,w_762,g_center,q_auto:best,dpr_1.6,f_auto,h_506/fjlirebv3qpqd7xdlsek" alt="The Over:Board" data-old-src="https://c0.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_fill,w_762,g_center,q_auto:best,dpr_1.6,f_auto,h_506/fjlirebv3qpqd7xdlsek" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>The Over:Board</figcaption></figure>



<p><br>It breaks out the following ports: <br></p>



<ul><li>24-pin ATX Power</li><li>40-pin GPIO</li><li>Full Size PCI-E @ 1x bandwidth</li><li>SATA Controller (Powered by USB)</li><li>Front Panel Header</li><li>CPU Fan Header</li><li>UART Header</li><li>Micro USB</li><li>RS232 Com Port</li><li>2x USB 2.0 Ports</li><li>Micro SD card slot</li><li>3.5mm Audio</li></ul>



<p>The Over:Board costs £199 for an early prototype or £99 for the Final Production board and is available to back now on indiegogo. <br></p>



<div><p>Whilst £99 is expensive for a IO board this is likely down to the limited production and it is likely still the cheapest ARM based ITX motherboard on the market even when factoring in the cost of a RPI CM4. </p><p>You can back the Over:Board on indiegogo <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/over-board-raspberry-pi-4-mini-itx-motherboard#/" target="_blank">here</a></p><p>For another ARM IO board with SATA check out my Nano Pi Neo2 NAS review <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/nano-pi-neo2-nas-enclosure-a-small-linux-home-server-nas/" target="_blank">here</a></p><p>The project currently has £1654 in backing from 11 backers. With 28 days left it is looking likely to hit its £5000 target. </p><p>Ross Nicoholls is leading the campaign: </p></div>



<blockquote><p>I’ve lost count exactly how many, but this will be about my 35th commercial electronics PCB to be manufactured, so I am no stranger to getting these things to market. That said however, this will be the first of my own venture so represents my most exciting project to date and something I feel very passionate about.</p><cite>Ross has lots of experience in this field</cite></blockquote>



<p>I wish Ross good luck and hope to see the Over:Board available soon! </p>

        <p>Over the past twenty five years as a prolific internet user I have been able to accomplish many feats.&nbsp; Some of which have garnered the attention of governments, others of family members.&nbsp; None of these though are as profound as the truly difficult feat of growing my subscriber list.</p><p>You would think that growing a list to three users would be something down right nearly impossible, as I did too.&nbsp; But in reality it turned out to be even harder than that!</p><p>Don't worry though, I wont lead you down the path of struggles and tribulations to get your self to three subscribers, I will instead show you the light at the end of the tunnel in a quick and simple walk through guide.</p><p>Obviously most people would wonder, "Wow John, how did you do it?" and thankfully I have an answer for you, it's simple really.&nbsp; Build a blog.&nbsp; After you have done this, put a email subscriber list at the bottom.</p><p>But that's not all, oh no I also thought just like I was promised by the field of dreams that if I build it, they will come.&nbsp; That was false, once I built the blog no one came.&nbsp; Thankfully that didn't matter or stop me from getting subscribers.</p><p>Instead once I had done the hard part of building the blog, and putting a email subscriber list on the bottom, I had to do the absolute most terrifying thing.&nbsp; Write a blog post.</p><p>Now of course most of you think, "By golly I'm terrible at writing, how will I ever get to three subscribers?" and for you I have an answer, write a test blog post.&nbsp; Something as complicated as "test blog post".</p><p>I know this may be daunting, but don't worry this will simply get all the pent up subscriber demand frothing at the mouth hoping for your next post.&nbsp; Of course this wont make them subscribe, but this will make you be very well on your way to your first subscriber.</p><p>Once you have made the test blog post, do the impossible.&nbsp; Go from zero to one, subscribe yourself to your blog.</p><p>Now of course this is a monumental moment for your blog and subscriber list.&nbsp; You should in reality pat yourself on the back.&nbsp; You have managed the mathematical improbability of growing at infinity percent.</p><p>Of course once you have relished in the joy that is your first subscriber, then forget you have a blog for a while.&nbsp; This is crucial, as patience is key for success.&nbsp; </p><p>Out of the blue once you get outraged at something in life, then write your second blog post.&nbsp; Call this post, First post.</p><p>To keep the potential subscribers believing that it is in fact your first post, and not the post that brought you from zero to one, delete the test post.&nbsp; Perhaps even maybe have a nice little digital funeral for it in which you wish it the best in the after life, and then move on.</p><p>After you successfully published the First post, do the unthinkable and send it to a friend, specifically asking them if the newsletter subscription works.<br></p><p>Congratulations, you have now gotten subscriber number two!&nbsp; Look at you go!</p><p>Now I have lead you this far, of course to reach post number three, well I got nothing on that one, that one just simply takes a bit of luck.<br></p>

By swapping a 10 percentage point share of employees from a â€œlow feasibilityâ€� level of working from home to a â€œhigh feasibilityâ€� level, average income increased by 1% while the Gini index, a measure of income inequality, increased by 0.4.</p><p dir="ltr">A Gini index of 100 is the maximum level of income inequality; Italy had a Gini index of 35.9 in 2017, according to the World Bank.</p><p dir="ltr">Italy was used as a case study for the paper, published Sept. 12, because it was the first Western country to adopt an economic lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The country also showed a particularly dramatic shift toward work-from-home as a result of the pandemic.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Prior to the coronavirus, Italyâ€™s share of remote workers was the lowest of any European country at 1%. As of June, roughly 90% of the countryâ€™s public sector workers were working from home, according to the Italian Minister of Administration.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the researchers relied on data from Italy, they said their findings â€œmay be useful to policymakers in other developed countries as wellâ€� as governments rethink production processes to incorporate more robust work-from-home policies.</p><p dir="ltr">In the U.S., for example, the pandemic quadrupled the number of people working from home to nearly 50% of the total workforce, and many countries are developing pandemic exit plans with continued high levels of work-from-home at the center.</p><p dir="ltr">Many companies, having invested time, energy and money into training and equipment for remote employees, are also likely to expand work-from-home policies even after the threat of COVID-19 has receded. Workers, managers and entrepreneurs have also spent months developing remote-working skills that they are unlikely to give up on, Scicchitano said.</p><p dir="ltr">If working from home becomes the new normal, the researchers said, â€œtemporary income support measures,â€� such as direct financial payments to citizens, â€œwill not be sufficient anymoreâ€� to prevent remote work from exacerbating income inequality.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, officials need to focus on policies that could better assist employees who work from home, Scicchitano said, such as increased child care facilities and financial support for families, increased the school enrollment rates and improved training courses for employees. Further worsening inequality from large-scale shifts, not every job can be done from home, creating classes of workers lacking in additional benefits that come from doing jobs remotely.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jobs in finance and insurance, communication and information and professional services â€” typically some of the higher-paying professions â€” can more easily be done remotely than jobs in hotels, restaurants and agriculture, which typically pay less, according to Scicchitano.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œAnd obviously in some sectors, there is a higher share of workers who are able to work from home,â€� he said in an interview with The Academic Times. â€œEven in this case, there are huge inequalities in the labor market.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers are currently working on a follow-up paper, set to be finished in the next month, investigating the impact that working from home has specifically had on the gender pay gap during and after the pandemic, Scicchitano said.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œDuring the pandemic, it is quite obvious because we have children at home and obviously more or less all the care of children is on women,â€� he said.</p><p>Some previous studies have found the productivity and wages of women have fallen during the pandemic, Scicchitano said, but itâ€™s unclear whether the gender pay gap would increase if working from home became the new normal.</p><p><em>The study</em><em>Â&nbsp;â€œWorking from home and income inequality: risks of a â€˜new normalâ€™ with COVID-19,â€� published Sept. 1</em><em>2 in the Journal of Population Economics, was authored by Luca Bonacini, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia; Giovanni Gallo, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and the National Institute for Public Policies Analysis; and Sergio Scicchitano, National Institute for Public Policies Analysis and the Global Labour Organisation.Â&nbsp;</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>When it comes to the subject of one-on-ones, there is plenty of material available advising on everything from the best questions to ask in one-on-ones to how often to have them. What the vast majority of these literature focus on are one-on-ones that you have with others. From your manager, to executives and your reports. There is however, less focus on a simple but powerful reflection tool that you can use and that is the self one-on-one which I explain below.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-self-one-on-one">What is a self one-on-one?</h2>
<p>It is difficult to truly define what a one-on-one is so I’ll borrow a definition from <a href="https://wideangle.com/what-is-a-one-on-one-1-1/">wideangle</a> which I like and is vague enough to cover the plethora of other definitions that exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental reason One-on-One Meetings exist is to give a platform to the direct report to allow them to communicate to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Applying this same definition, a self one-on-one becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental reason self One-on-One Meetings exist is to give a platform to you to allow you to communicate to yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-should-you-do-self-one-on-ones">Why should you do self one-on-ones?</h2>
<p>We have one-on-ones with others because they are useful. They help in career growth, spreading of information and holding of accountability. Similarly, self one-on-ones help with these except for oneself. Self one-on-ones also provide structure/process for the reflection time you may already be blocking out of your calendar regularly. How often do you get to reflection time and are unsure what to think about?</p>
<h2 id="principles-for-self-one-on-ones">Principles for self one-on-ones</h2>
<p>To successfully use self one-on-ones, apply the same principles you use in one-on-ones with your reports to yourself. A few examples are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do not skip self one-on-ones</li>
<li>Self one-on-ones occur every X weeks</li>
<li>All self one-on-ones have an agenda</li>
<li>Notes are taken from self one-on-ones</li>
<li>Self one-on-ones have a schedule balancing career growth, status updates and well being</li>
<li>Self one-on-ones have action items that are followed on</li>
<li>Go on a walk with yourself if you do walking one-on-ones</li>
<li>Whatever other principles you have for one-on-ones</li>
</ol>
<p>As you start self one-on-ones, it will be awkward at first; Posing questions and talking to yourself. After a while though, they feel normal and help you focus on your own personal growth and well being.</p>

Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.</p>  <p>Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.</p>  <p>"So we've now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That's the good news," he said. "That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1842141251676-metadata-" title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/643/819/COVID-VARIANT-SCI-BIRAK-080121.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>The B1-17 coronavirus variant, first discovered in the U.K., is now in at least 40 countries, including Canada. It has 23 mutations, including one that attaches to healthy cells like a key going into a lock.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:56</span></span></span></p>  <p>Dormitzer said another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, was also concerning.</p>  <p>The researchers plan to run similar tests to establish whether the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the British and South African variants and hope to have more data within weeks.</p>  <p>The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness.</p>  <p>The virus's spikes act as a key that must unlock our cells to cause the infection.&nbsp;The variant first identified in the U.K. has a mutation that appears to make it easier for the coronavirus to grab hold of the lock more tightly, scientists say.</p>    <p>Scientists said the results of the study would help calm concerns that people will not be protected by vaccines being given to millions of people around the world in the fight against the pandemic, which has killed more than 1.8 million people and roiled economies.</p>  <p>But they cautioned that more clinical tests and data are still needed to come to a definitive conclusion.</p>  <p>"This is good news, mainly because it is not bad news," said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the&nbsp;London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p>  <p>"So, yes this is good news, but it does not yet give us total confidence that the Pfizer (or other) vaccines will definitely give protection."</p>  <h2>AstraZeneca, Moderna, CureVac testing against variants</h2>  <p>AstraZeneca, Moderna and CureVac are also testing whether their shots work against the fast-spreading variants.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>In my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/">previous post</a>, I discussed how I’ve decided to learn F# in 2021 for a number of reasons. Around the same time, I also happened to setup my Sim Racing rig so that I could continue to play <a href="https://www.iracing.com/" target="_blank">iRacing</a> with my VR headset (HTC Vive). Its been several years since I’ve last played, but with COVID-related curfews being implemented here in Montreal tomorrow, I’ve been increasingly taking up home-based pursuits which I didn’t always have the time for pre-lockdown. Since the last time I played iRacing, I’m running a PC with a much better processor, motherboard, and only SSDs. The VR performance has been a huge leap forward since I used to play with my old machine and I was quite impressed. After spending a couple of hours setting up, here’s what my current humble racing setup looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/racing-rig.jpg" width="650" height="488" alt="Photo of my current iRacing VR setup"></p>

<p>Having a dedicated table really helps, as in my old apartment it was fairly difficult to setup a station with limited space, but now I can fortunately just jump in. Despite the past limitations, I was able to get fairly competitive and still remember the thrill of my first win agaisnt a field of real racers in a Mazda MX-5:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/iracing-win.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="Photo of my iRacing first win certificate"></p>

<p>Inspired by setting everything up and doing some laps to practice for an eventual return to comeptition, I started thinking about how I once experimented with using the <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk" target="_blank">Python implementation</a> of the iRacing SDK to connect to an arduino and display a speedometer readout in realtime on a small screen. In reminiscing about the experience, I thought about how I could look into writing an F# implementation of the SDK as a learning project. In addition to learning through the project, it also has the benefit of being of use in a future project involving an iRacing stats tracker web app that I’ve been thinking about writing as a project for my upcoming <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/">cloud computing courses</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>I tend to learn best when projects are slightly outside of my comfort zone, and this would be both my first time writing a library, as well as writing one in a functional language! Having used an array of libraries at this point, I had some confidence in choosing an organizational structure, and the Python implementation is only <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk/blob/master/irsdk.py" target="_blank">739 lines of code</a> which felt doable compared to some of the larger libraries out there.</p>

<p>Moreover, the python implementation of the SDK has the ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get session data (WeekendInfo, SessionInfo, etc…)</li>
  <li>Get live telemetry data (Speed, FuelLevel, etc…)</li>
  <li>Broadcast messages (camera, replay, chat, pit and telemetry commands)</li>
</ul>

<p>and I figured that this would be a good featureset to aim for in the final version of the F# SDK. Out of these features, the session data and live telemetry data would be the ones I plan to implement first.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-library">Creating the Library</h2>

<p>After coming up with some desired features, the first step was to create a new FSharp solution called iRacingFSharp. Inside the solution, I created two projects. One was our actual library, called iRacingFSharp, and the other was a basic console app called SDKReader (located in the Examples Folder) to test the functionality of the library as I worked on it. Note, if you’d like to see the full codebase you can <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">here on github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-function">The First Function</h2>

<p>Starting small, I decided that a good first function would be to find out the state of the simulator. Fortunately, the iRacing SDK allows you to check if the sim is running using the following URL which points to a localhost server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Getting this URL in Postman returns a JSON object which looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var simStatus={
   running:0 // 1 if the sim is running
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to make use of the <a href="https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/Http.html" target="_blank">F# Data HTTP library</a> in order to download the response and so I installed it from NuGet at this point.</p>

<p>Next, inside my iRacingFSharp project I created a file called Irsdk.fs and wrote the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span>

<span>open</span> <span>FSharp</span><span>.</span><span>Data</span>

<span>///&lt;summary&gt;F# implementation of the iRacing SDK.&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>module</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>///&lt;summary&gt;Returns the simStatus in string format&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusURL</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus"</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusObject</span> <span>=</span> <span>Http</span><span>.</span><span>RequestString</span><span>(</span><span>simStatusURL</span><span>)</span>
        <span>simStatusObject</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, I’ve created a module which contains a function called SimStatus that takes no parameters. It then binds the JSON response to simStatusURL and passes it to the HTTP library via Http.RequestString(). Finally, simStatusObject is returned in string format which can be parsed further by another function in a later step.</p>



<p>With this simple function in place, the next step was to create SDKReader.fs inside my SDKReader console app. This file contained code to call the SimStatus() function and print the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>argv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>test</span> <span>=</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span><span>.</span><span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"%s"</span> <span>test</span>
    <span>0</span> <span>// return an integer exit code</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running dotnet build inside the SDKReader folder displayed the following output while iRacing was running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"var simStatus={
   running:1
};
"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! With this method working, we now have the very beginnings of an F# implementation of the iRacing SDK! Although it is a small step, we were also able to create and structure the project. Lastly, I also setup a a basic .NET build through Github Actions for CI.</p>



<p>iRacing’s API telemetry comes in three variations; data written to a .ibt file 60 times a second, live data exposed to the telemetry API 60 times per second, and a session string in YAML format that contains more or less static information about the session. The YAML string is appended to the end of the .ibt file but only a small portion of that data is exposed. This means that going forward, I’ll need to look into parsing the YAML as well as mapping more of the API endpoints. The iRacing API appears to be nonstandard and so it may take a little more work than just a typical REST API.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Part Two where I plan to implement some telemetry functions and look into parsing the aforementioned YAML. In addition, be sure to follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">Github Repo here</a> if you’re interested in seeing how to project progresses (or would like to contribute)!</p>

<p>There are lots of problems with ad-tech:</p>
<ul>
<li>being spied on all the time means that the people of the 21st century are less able to be their authentic selves;
</li>
<li>
<p>any data that is collected and retained will eventually breach, creating untold harms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>data-collection enables for discriminatory business practices ("digital redlining");</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the huge, tangled hairball of adtech companies siphons lots (maybe even most) of the money that should go creators and media orgs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anti-adblock demands browsers and devices that thwart their owners' wishes, a capability that can be exploited for even more nefarious purposes;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all terrible, but it's also <em>ironic</em>, since it appears that, in addition to everything else, ad-tech is a fraud, a bezzle.</p>
<p>Bezzle was John Kenneth Galbraith's term for "the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it." That is, a rotten log that has yet to be turned over.</p>
<p>Bezzles unwind slowly, then all at once. We've had some important peeks under ad-tech's rotten log, and they're increasing in both intensity and velocity. If you follow Aram Zucker-Scharff, you've had a front-row seat to the fraud.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Chronotope/status/1078003966863200256">https://twitter.com/Chronotope/status/1078003966863200256</a></p>
<p>Time and again, everything in the ad-tech stack has been demonstrated to be fraudulent: fake audiences firing fake clicks at fake videos on fake sites that suck real dollars out of advertisers' accounts.</p>
<p>This was masterfully elucidated in Tim Hwang's short 2020 book SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS, whose thesis is: we must deflate the ad-tech bubble intentionally, lest we get a messy rupture that destroys many of the good things the parasite has colonized.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost</a></p>
<p>The ad-tech fraud is many-layered. On the surface, there's the counting frauds: fake clicks, fake sites, fake videos, etc. But there's a deeper fraud, a theory fraud, the fraud that with enough surveillance data and machine learning, ad-tech can sell anyone anything.</p>
<p>That is: even if we count accurately, ads are still overvalued and underperforming. This is also a lesson whose examples are coming with increasing tempo, as when Ebay simply stopped buying Google search ads and saw <em>no</em> decrease in sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/06/surveillance-tulip-bulbs/#adtech-bubble">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/06/surveillance-tulip-bulbs/#adtech-bubble</a></p>
<p>In a piece for Forbes, marketer-turned-antifraud-auditor Dr Augustine Fou rounds up some of the grossest things festering under the ad-tech log.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2021/01/02/when-big-brands-stopped-spending-on-digital-ads-nothing-happened-why/?sh=5a4f9c9a1166">https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2021/01/02/when-big-brands-stopped-spending-on-digital-ads-nothing-happened-why/?sh=5a4f9c9a1166</a></p>
<p>Like that time in 2018 when Procter and Gamble – inventors of "brand marketing" – turned off $200m worth of ad-tech buys and saw no change to their sales. Or when Chase killed 95% of its advertising and kept all of its business.</p>
<p>Most interesting is the tale of how Uber allowed itself to be defrauded of $150m/year, for years, by ad-tech intermediaries. It's a story told in detail by former Uber head of "performance marketing" Kevin Frisch on the Marketing Today podcast:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marketingtodaypodcast.com/194-historic-ad-fraud-at-uber-with-kevin-frisch/">https://www.marketingtodaypodcast.com/194-historic-ad-fraud-at-uber-with-kevin-frisch/</a></p>
<p>It starts with the revelation that $50m of its annual spend on customer acquisitions – money paid when an ad leads to a new Uber customer downloading the app, entering payment details and taking their first ride – was fraudulent.</p>
<p>Here's how that worked: scummy marketers fielded low-quality apps (like battery monitors) that requested root access. These apps spied on every app you installed. If you installed Uber, they "fired a click" to the system to report you as having been "converted" by an ad.</p>
<p>After clearing $50m of fraud, Frisch continued to dig into the system. In the end, about $120m of the $150m was being stolen, pocketed for fake clicks on fake sites by fake users.</p>
<p>In a fascinating turn, Frisch describes how his colleagues were indifferent or actively hostile to his efforts. Uber was in "growth mode," trying to beef up its numbers prior to the IPO where suckers would relieve its Saudi royal investors.</p>
<p>Uber is a company that will never, ever be profitable. It, too, is a bezzle. It only "works" if outside investors – marks – can somehow be convinced to buy the insiders' stock, which requires the appearance of growth – AKA "A pile of shit this big <em>must</em> have a pony under it!"</p>
<p>So execs like Frisch were required to "spend to budget" – to maintain the appearance of growth, including (especially) the growth of its "precision analytics" marketing, where ad-tech spends turned into directly attributable customer acquisitions.</p>
<p>This is the story that keeps on giving, because it all starts with Sleeping Giant's campaign to force Uber to stop advertising on Breitbart, and Uber's inability to get its ad-tech "partners" to definitively switch off Breitbart ads.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1345774768746852353">https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1345774768746852353</a></p>
<p>The system's layers of misdirection – there to hide the fraud – meant that it behaved nondeterministically and couldn't fulfil simple requests, which triggered the search.</p>
<p>There's a theory that the reason Big Tech spies on us so much is that they're really good at turning data into sales (and, by extension, influence, as in elections, referenda, etc). But it is increasingly apparent that Big Tech's spying is part of a bezzle.</p>
<p>That is, we're being surveilled, doxed, placed under automated suspicion and digitally discriminated against all to put on a show that separates marks from their dollars.</p>
<p>This is the theme of my 2020 book HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM:</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Namely, that we are under constant surveillane because monopolies can get away with obviously fraudulent and dangerous conduct by mobilizing their monopoly profits to buy political outcomes that serve their ends.</p>
<p>This is also what happened with California's Proposition 22, the most expensive ballot initiative in US history: Uber didn't spearhead a $200m campaign to legalize worker misclassification to become profitable.</p>
<p>Uber will never be profitable.</p>
<p>All that money was spent to maintain the fiction, the fraud, the bezzle – it was an appeal to rescue the wholly fictional pony underneath that gigantic pile of shit.</p>

<p>Google workers have announced their intention to form a union, under the auspices of CWA Local 1440. The union is called The Alphabet Workers Union (Google maintains the legal and accounting fiction that it is a division of a holding company called "Alphabet").</p>
<p>Speaking of legal fictions, the union is opening membership to "TVCs" – temps, vendors and contractors – employees who have been deliberately misclassified so as to avoid paying them benefits or extending normal workplace protections to them.</p>
<p>It's a bold move, a countermeasure to thwart the other commercial advantage from worker misclassification: by creating multiple categories of workers, bosses can pit employees against one another, by dangling privileges in front of one group but not the other.</p>
<p>But it comes at a high price: to gain official legal recognition, more than 50% of eligible workers must join the union. By including more workers, the union is setting a higher bar for official status.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an5q9/google-workers-publicly-launch-union">https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an5q9/google-workers-publicly-launch-union</a></p>
<p>But the union has momentum: a series of high-profile googler uprisings – driven by official tolerance for sexual misconduct, complicity in US military drone programs, secret collaboration with Chinese surveillance and censorship, and more – show how radicalized googlers are.</p>
<p>Google's management – who cultivated an air of participatory, cuddly collaboration – have arrived at a point where the contradictions between their "values" and the company's profits can no longer be reconciled.</p>
<p>In Dec 2020, Google fired Timnit Gebru, an eminent Black AI scientist who refused to retract a paper critical of its profitable Big Data research. Management compounded their sins by making false claims about Gebru's dismissal.</p>
<p>The unionization drive is under the CWA's #CODE (Coalition to Organize Digital Employees) project. Though CODE is no stranger to conflict, Google represents a serious challenge, thanks to its partnership with notorious union-busters IRI Consultants.</p>
<p>(IRI's tactics pale in comparison to the mercenaries that Amazon has hired to bust its unions: the Pinkerton company, who have spilled rivers of workers' blood in their murderous history):</p>

As a Chaos Engineering platform, Chaos Mesh has supported simulating I/O faults in a filesystem ever since its early versions. By simply adding an IOChaos CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), we can watch how the filesystem fails and returns errors.</p><p>However, before Chaos Mesh 1.0, this experiment was not easy and may have consumed a lot of resources. We needed to inject sidecar containers to the Pod through the mutating admission webhooks and rewrite the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> command. Even if no fault was injected, the injected sidecar container caused a substantial amount of overhead.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 has changed all this. Now, we can use IOChaos to inject faults to a filesystem at runtime. This simplifies the process and greatly reduces system overhead. This blog post introduces how we implement the IOChaos experiment without using a sidecar.</p><h2>I/O fault injection<a href="#io-fault-injection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To simulate I/O faults at runtime, we need to inject faults into a filesystem after the program starts <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system calls</a> (such as reads and writes) but before the call requests arrive at the target filesystem. We can do that in one of two ways:</p><ul><li>Use Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF); however, it <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot be used to inject delay</a>.</li><li>Add a filesystem layer called ChaosFS before the target filesystem. ChaosFS uses the target filesystem as the backend and receives requests from the operating system. The entire call link is <strong>target program syscall</strong> -&gt; <strong>Linux kernel</strong> -&gt; <strong>ChaosFS</strong> -&gt; <strong>target filesystem</strong>. Because ChaosFS is customizable, we can inject delays and errors as we want. Therefore, ChaosFS is our choice.</li></ul><p>But ChaosFS has several problems:</p><ul><li>If ChaosFS reads and writes files in the target filesystem, we need to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount</a> ChaosFS to a different path than the target path specified in the Pod configuration. ChaosFS <strong>cannot</strong> be mounted to the path of the target directory.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS <strong>before</strong> the target program starts running. This is because the newly-mounted ChaosFS takes effect only on files that are newly opened by the program in the target filesystem.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS to the target containter's <code>mnt</code> namespace. For details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount_namespaces(7) — Linux manual page</a>.</li></ul><p>Before Chaos Mesh 1.0, we used the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutating admission webhook</a> to implement IOChaos. This technique addressed the three problems lists above and allowed us to:</p><ul><li>Run scripts in the target container. This action changed the target directory of the ChaosFS's backend filesystem (for example, from <code>/mnt/a</code> to <code>/mnt/a_bak</code>) so that we could mount ChaosFS to the target path (<code>/mnt/a</code>).
Modify the command that starts the Pod. For example, we could modify the original command <code>/app</code> to <code>/waitfs.sh /app</code>.</li><li>The <code>waitfs.sh</code> script kept checking whether the filesystem was successfully mounted. If it was mounted, <code>/app</code> was started.</li><li>Add a new container in the Pod to run ChaosFS. This container needed to share a volume with the target container (for example, <code>/mnt</code>), and then we mounted this volume to the target directory (for example, <code>/mnt/a</code>). We also properly enabled <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount propagation</a> for this volume's mount to penetrate the share to host and then penetrate slave to the target.</li></ul><p>These three approaches allowed us to inject I/O faults while the program was running. However, the injection was far from convenient:</p><ul><li>We could only inject faults into a volume subdirectory, not into the entire volume. The workaround was to replace <code>mv</code> (rename) with <code>mount move</code> to move the mount point of the target volume.</li><li>We had to explicitly write commands in the Pod rather than implicitly use the image commands. Otherwise, the <code>/waitfs.sh</code> script could not properly start the program after the filesystem was mounted.</li><li>The corresponding container needed to have a proper configuration for mount propagation. Due to potential privacy and security issues, we <strong>could not</strong> modify the configuration via the mutating admission webhook.</li><li>The injection configuration was troublesome. Worse still, we had to create a new Pod after the configuration was able to inject faults.</li><li>We could not withdraw ChaosFS while the program was running. Even if no fault or error was injected, the performance was greatly affected.</li></ul><h2>Inject I/O faults without the mutating admission webhook<a href="#inject-io-faults-without-the-mutating-admission-webhook" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>What about cracking these tough nuts without the mutating admission webhook? Let's get back and think a bit about the reason why we used the mutating admission webhook to add a container in which ChaosFS runs. We do that to mount the filesystem to the target container.</p><p>In fact, there is another solution. Instead of adding containers to the Pod, we can first use the <code>setns</code> Linux system call to modify the namespace of the current process and then use the <code>mount</code> call to mount ChaosFS to the target container. Suppose that the filesystem to inject is <code>/mnt</code>. The new injection process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Use <code>setns</code> for the current process to enter the mnt namespace of the target container.</li><li>Execute <code>mount --move</code> to move <code>/mnt</code> to <code>/mnt_bak</code>.</li><li>Mount ChaosFS to <code>/mnt</code> and use <code>/mnt_bak</code> as the backend.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, the target container will open, read, and write the files in <code>/mnt</code> through ChaosFS. In this way, delays or faults are injected much more easily. However, there are still two questions to answer:</p><ul><li>How do you handle the files that are already opened by the target process?</li><li>How do you recover the process given that we cannot unmount the filesystem when files are opened?</li></ul><h3>Dynamically replace file descriptors<a href="#dynamically-replace-file-descriptors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>ptrace solves both of the two questions above.</strong> We can use ptrace to replace the opened file descriptors (FD) at runtime and replace the current working directory (CWD) and mmap.</p><h4>Use ptrace to allow a tracee to run a binary program<a href="#use-ptrace-to-allow-a-tracee-to-run-a-binary-program" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ptrace</a> is a powerful tool that makes the target process (tracee) to run any system call or binary program. For a tracee to run the program, ptrace modifies the RIP-pointed address to the target process and adds an <code>int3</code> instruction to trigger a breakpoint. When the binary program stops, we need to restore the registers and memory.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86_64 architecture</a>, the RIP register (also called an instruction pointer) always points to the memory address at which the next directive is run.
To load the program into the target process memory spaces:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Use ptrace to call mmap in the target program to allocate the needed memory.</li><li>Write the binary program to the newly allocated memory and make the RIP register point to it.</li><li>After the binary program stops, call munmap to clean up the memory section.</li></ol><p>As a best practice, we often replace ptrace <code>POKE_TEXT</code> writes with <code>process_vm_writev</code> because if there is a huge amount of data to write, <code>process_vm_writev</code> performs more efficiently.</p><p>Using ptrace, we are able to make a process to replace its own FD. Now we only need a method to make that replacement happen. This method is the <code>dup2</code> system call.</p><h4>Use <code>dup2</code> to replace file descriptor<a href="#use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The signature of the <code>dup2</code> function is <code>int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);</code>. It is used to create a copy of the old FD (<code>oldfd</code>). This copy has an FD number of <code>newfd</code>. If <code>newfd</code> already corresponds to the FD of an opened file, the FD on the file that's already opened is automatically closed.</p><p>For example, the current process opens <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> whose FD is <code>1</code>. To replace this opened file with <code>/var/run/test/a</code>, this process performs the following operations:</p><ol><li>Uses the <code>fcntl</code> system call to get the <code>OFlags</code> (the parameter used by the <code>open</code> system call, such as <code>O_WRONLY</code>) of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>Iseek</code> system call to get the current location of <code>seek</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>open</code> system call to open <code>/var/run/test/a</code> using the same <code>OFlags</code>. Assume that the FD is <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>Iseek</code> to change the <code>seek</code> location of the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>dup2(2, 1)</code> to replace the FD <code>1</code> of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> with the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Closes FD <code>2</code>.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, FD <code>1</code> of the current process points to <code>/var/run/test/a</code>. So that we can inject faults, any subsequent operations on the target file go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filesystem in Userspace</a> (FUSE). FUSE is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code.</p><h4>Write a program to make the target process replace its own file descriptor<a href="#write-a-program-to-make-the-target-process-replace-its-own-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The combined functionality of ptrace and dup2 make it possible for the tracer to make the tracee replace the opened FD by itself. Now, we need to write a binary program and make the target process run it:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the implementation above, we assume that:</p><ul><li>The threads of the target process are POSIX threads and share the opened files.</li><li>When the target process creates threads using the <code>clone</code> function, the <code>CLONE_FILES</code> parameter is passed.</li></ul><p>Therefore, Chaos Mesh only replaces the FD of the first thread in the thread group.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Write a piece of assembly code according to the two sections above and the usage of syscall directives. <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda/blob/1d73871d8ab72b8d1eace55f5222b01957193531/src/replacer/fd_replacer.rs#L133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is an example of the assembly code.</li><li>Use an assembler to translate the code into a binary program. We use <a href="https://github.com/CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynasm-rs</a> as the assembler.</li><li>Use ptrace to make the target process run this program.
When the program runs, the FD is replaced at runtime.</li></ol><h3>Overall fault injection process<a href="#overall-fault-injection-process" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The following diagram illustrates the overall I/O fault injection process:</p><p><img alt="Fault injection process" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/fault-injection-process-581a3b4c6954f9ccb3fc9eb17f45f937.jpg"></p><p> Fault injection process </p><p>In this diagram, each horizontal line corresponds to a thread that runs in the direction of the arrows. The <strong>Mount/Umount Filesystem</strong> and <strong>Replace FD</strong> tasks are carefully arranged in sequence.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5963" role="main"><div><div><div><p>Contractual agreements often make generous use of “ALL-CAPS” to draw special attention to the important parts of the text. The idea, ostensibly, is that by making those capitalized terms stand out, consumers will pay more attention to them.</p><p>But as the authors of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new paper on all-caps</a> explain, the notion that this archaic technique improves consumer consent has never been validated. Even today, there is still no empirical evidence to support it.</p><p>So researchers Yonathan Arbel and Andrew Toler, of the University of Alabama School of Law, decided to put all-caps to the test. In several experiments, they found no benefits to capitalizing blocks of text in a contract. If anything, readers, especially older readers, found that text written in all-caps is harder to understand.</p><p>Their new paper appeared in November in the <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17401461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Empirical Legal Studies</a></em>. Its authors say it is the first “to empirically examine the effectiveness of all‐caps.”</p><h2>A bad idea with a long history</h2><p>This lack of prior research into the contractual use of all-caps is odd. The practice is quite old, and the stakes are high. The belief in the benefits of capitalization dates back to at least the 19th century. And even today, many courts, legislators, and government agencies still insist that the key terms of a contract be displayed in all-caps, ostensibly to protect consumers.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>Courts, for example, often rule that text written in capital letters makes it sufficiently conspicuous. Likewise, if key parts of a contract are not written in all-caps, courts will often deny enforcement.</p><p>This practice has serious and wide-ranging effects. It influences contractual liability in areas such as wrongful death claims, arbitration agreements, and consumer warranties.</p><p>So if all‐caps formatting does not in fact improve “the meaningfulness of assent,” as the authors write, “then courts have been erroneously enforcing onerous terms,” and have been “depriving consumers of recourse based on faulty assumptions.”</p><h2>All-caps everywhere</h2><p>For this study, the authors collected standard contracts from 500 companies in the United States, such as Google, Facebook, Uber, and Amazon. They found that 77% of these contracts have at least one clause in all-caps, suggesting the practice is still very much alive.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>They also tested whether all-caps formatting actually helps people to comprehend or recall such contractual clauses. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, they recruited a sample of 570 participants in the United States. About 45% of them were female, and their average age was 38.</p><p>The researchers instructed the participants to read through a two‐page contract, containing 15 paragraphs. They modelled this document on Spotify’s end-user agreement. One version, read by half of the participants, contained one paragraph written in all-caps. The other half of the subjects read the same contract, only with this paragraph written using normal capitalization. The researchers then tested how accurately the participants answered questions about a term that appeared in that paragraph.</p><h2>No helpful effect at all</h2><p>They found that all‐caps had no effect on improving the readers’ comprehension or recall. Instead, they found some evidence that all‐caps actually decreases comprehension for older readers. Participants older than 55 were 29% <em>more</em> likely to misunderstand their obligations when they read the contract with the capitalized paragraph. In fact, “the older group answered incorrectly at almost double the rate of same‐age peers in the control group,” who read the same paragraph with normal formatting.</p><p>A smaller experiment also found that all-caps offered no benefits when the text had to be read very quickly. Another test showed that an all-caps version of a text was 22% more difficult to read and understand. And a final experiment demonstrated that all‐caps paragraphs take 13% longer to read, without leading to any improvement in recall.</p><h2>Why does block capitalization fail?</h2><p>Past research has shown that all‐caps formatting obscures the differences between letters, because capital letters lack ascenders and descenders. That sameness makes the text harder to read.</p><p>Cultural changes also play a role. Long ago, capital letters signified grandeur and seriousness. But in today’s Internet culture, the authors point out, “there is a growing convention that <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/117390/netiquette-capitalization-how-caps-became-code-yelling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all‐caps is similar in effect to yelling</a>.” This negative emotional association might encourage readers, consciously or unconsciously, to ignore text written in all-caps.</p><p>Add to that the fact <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/why-are-americans-vocabulary-skills-stagnating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Americans’ vocabulary levels are dropping</a>, and it soon becomes clear that a lot of contractual texts aren’t being properly read.</p><h2><strong>Dubious incentives</strong> to hide contractual liability</h2><p>Though typical sales texts will capitalize some words (BUY NOW!), they rarely capitalize entire paragraphs in the way contracts do. In other words, when companies want to make important features conspicuous, they use a range of design tools such as varying colors, typefaces, and backgrounds. These texts “have no resemblance to the texts they use to obligate and bind consumers,” the authors write.</p><p>So why do companies continue to use all-caps in texts that should ideally make contractual liability crystal clear? Do they “genuinely believe,” the authors ask, “that using all‐caps will promote consumer understanding?” A more sinister interpretation is that companies “take advantage of judicial naiveté to <a href="https://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/1063/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hide some of the most onerous and costly terms in plain sight</a> by using all‐caps.” In this scenario, the authors write, “not only do courts not protect consumers’ interests by favoring all‐caps, they invite abuse.”</p><h2><strong>A better and bolder alternative</strong> to all caps</h2><p>So if archaic and shouty all-caps formatting doesn’t work, what does?</p><p>The researchers compared four other ways of highlighting text, and found that boldface had the most promising results.</p><p>In two experiments, bold text outperformed “boxing” text in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumer_box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so-called Schumer Box</a> (New York Senator Chuck Schumer sponsored legislation to make credit card statements easier to understand).</p><p>It aso outperformed “single caps” (i.e. one sentence written in all-caps within a paragraph otherwise capitalized normally), or normal text. These results support prior research showing that readers prefer boldface over other types of emphasis. And they also demonstrate that formatting interventions can indeed improve consumers’ ability to understand the important terms of the contractual agreements they enter into.</p><p>The authors of this paper pull no punches in calling for change. “We believe that there is a compelling reason to abolish judicial reliance on all‐caps,” they write. “Courts should stop giving&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;weight to the use of all‐caps in contracts,” and “should desist the century‐old policy of encouraging firms to use them in their contracts.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“ALL-CAPS”<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonathan Arbel and Andrew Toler<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17401461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Empirical Legal Studies</a></em><br><strong>Publication date: </strong>November 2, 2020<br><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jels.12272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1111/jels.12272</a><br><strong>Photo:</strong> by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pexels.com/@olly?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Andrea Piacquadio</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-holding-card-while-operating-silver-laptop-919436/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a></p><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology research and psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://psychnewsweekly.substack.com/p/coming-soon?r=3s6yi&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=copy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

  <p>If there was any doubt before, COVID-19 made it clear: <em>digital life is real life</em>.  Our lives exist on the Internet no less so than on the streets. But while we control the streets (via the state), the Internet is made of centralized platforms controlled by commercial corporates.</p>

<p>If digital life is real life, with the internet acting as an integral part of our social structure, we should control it rather than be controlled by it.</p>

<p>This article presents self-governing Internet organizations (SGOs): digital organizations that are owned and governed by their users. We suggest SGOs as an alternative to commercial control of the internet.</p>

<p>SGOs are an idea that brings democratic states forward into the digital age. Their technical implementation has been made possible by developments in the blockchain movement over the last decade.</p>

<p>The unique value of SGOs is “power to the people of the Internet”. No more power to rich owners, just let the people of the Internet rule themselves.</p>

<p>Part I lays the philosophical foundations for SGOs, while Part II would discuss the technical implementation.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>First, to clarify, “governing” means in all aspects of the organization. From moderating content to monetizing its products. Users own these SGOs organizations in all possible meanings.</p>

<p>For example, cooperatives are SGOs, but they are normally governed by the workers rather than their users (or customers). Democratic states are another example of SGOs (since they are governed by their citizens), but they are not digital.</p>

<p>Those two unique properties, being governed by the users and being digital, make it difficult to create SGOs.</p>

<p>It is difficult to create an organization governed by its users, because who <em>exactly</em> are those users? Is anyone who used a project of the organization once is a “user” (with voting rights)? Are users only paying customers? Or maybe “users” is a more broad term, that includes also developers, maintainers, managers, and investors?</p>

<p>It is difficult to create self-governing organizations, since how can they be self-governed without using a third party? also, if a third party is involved, is it still governed by the users or rather by this party? It’s easier for a group of people to manage a self-governing organization in real life, but a digital one is challenging.</p>

<p>There’s no algorithm for designing an SGO. It is, after all, a human community, and each human community should be designed independently, to fit the unique spirit of its human members.</p>

<p>Listed below are general principles SGOs should follow in order to be digital self-governing organizations. Part II of this article would describe the technical tools to implement SGOs that follow these principles.</p>

<h2 id="the-ten-principles-of-self-governing-internet-organizations">The ten principles of self-governing Internet organizations</h2>
<p>The “Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers”, an early cooperative, opened its store on 21 December 1844. The 28 founders were skilled workers, pushed into poverty by the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>The Rochdale society was not the first cooperative in history. There were a few hundred failed attempts in creating cooperatives before that. But it was the first cooperative that succeeded. The Rochdale society created “Rochdale Principles” based on the previous failed attempts. Following those principles, they managed to create a successful cooperative.</p>

<p>Inspired by the “Rochdale Principles”, we create a set of principles for SGOs. Our principles are based on many examples of Internet platforms and blockchain organizations from the 21st century. Principles 3, 4, 6, and 7 are adapted from Rochdale principles themselves.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Users first/prioritizing users</strong>. the SGO’s main priority is benefiting its users. All decisions are taken under the constraint that they either benefit or otherwise do not harm, the users.</p>

    <p><em>Two assumptions underlie this principle</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>An organization with enough users has myriad monetizing opportunities, meaning there is no bankruptcy risk in prioritizing users.</em></li>
      <li><em>There would be no need for SGOs if commercial Internet organizations would prioritize their users first.</em>
 <br>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Users are members</strong>. Members of an SGO are its own users. If further non-users members exist they should come from all parties of interest in the organization, e.g., contributors, investors, advertisers, etc.</p>

    <p><em>This principle differentiates SGOs from worker cooperatives (where only contributors are members) and consumers’ cooperatives (where only users are members).</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Voluntary and open membership</strong>. SGOs are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without nationality, geographically, gender, social, racial, political, or religious discrimination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Democratic member control</strong>. SGOs are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Members equality: one member one vote</strong>. All members have equal influence, without nationality, geographically, gender, social, racial, political, or religious discrimination. One full member gets one vote.</p>

    <p>However, due to the dynamic nature of the internet, it may take time to become a full member (with an equal vote). Partial members have a partial vote, but it must be that each partial member becomes a full member given enough time has elapsed (the exact period of time may vary from one member to another, but must be pre-defined when the member joins).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Autonomy and independence</strong>. SGOs are autonomous organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their autonomy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cooperation among SGOs</strong>. SGOs serve their members most effectively and strengthen the self-governing movement by working together to create bigger self-governing digital social structures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Concern for the internet</strong>. Regardless of the SGO’s main activity, it must always take steps to ensure the openness of the Internet as mentioned in <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">the Mozilla manifesto</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>self-sustainable</strong>. An SGO must thrive to be self-sustainable, both in a financial manner and in its dependencies on other services. If the SGO uses a service it must ensure that the service is fair to the community, and can be changed in case of problem arises with the entity supplying it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>compensating individual innovation</strong>. An SGO must promote users’ innovation, including users adding features and content to the SGO projects. Users may monetize any feature they add without a-priory permission from the organization and may enjoy the majority of the revenues received from these features (though at least part of it must be given to the SGO if the revenue is high enough)</p>

    <p><em>This last complex principle is an effort to bring the benefits of the capital philosophy to SGOs, with a light version of the tax.</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

        <h2>Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive</h2>
      </p>
      
        
      

      <div><p>Donald Trump loves to tweet and everyone knows that.
Twitter is his favorite medium to express his ideas and to communicate with the world.
He has been an active Twitter user since 2009. Much longer than many other world leaders.</p>
<p>Last month (May 2020) he tweeted 845 times â€” that's 28 tweets per day on average!</p>
<center>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/491324429184823296"><img src="https://pikaso.me/blog/files/pikaso.me-realDonaldTrump-20140721_205046-491324429184823296.png" alt="Trump Tweet" width="500" height="244"></a>
</center>
<p>A while ago we received a request from one of our users who was looking for a way to screenshot all Donald Trump tweets.
We realized that's a good opportunity to put <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a> into test and see if it can perform such a task without any problems.
It went smoothly and there was only an issue with one of his tweets which included a deleted image.</p>
<p>Today, we are releasing the resulting files to the public.
This archive contains screenshots of 43,475 Donald Trump tweets from May 2009 to May 2020.
Whether you are pro- or anti- Trump, this is an important part of Internet history that we believe should be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>The Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive can be downloaded through the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.zip">trump_twitter_archive_v1.zip</a> (Direct download, 2.6 GB)</li>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.torrent">trump_twitter_archive_v1.torrent</a> (Torrent download, 28.2 KB)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="howthiswasmade">How This Was Made?</h3>
<p>To create this archive, we first extracted all tweet ids from the realDonaldTrump.csv file that was provided to us.
That file only contained Donald Trump tweets up to March 29, 2020. To get the later tweets, we used <a href="http://trumptwitterarchive.com/">trumptwitterarchive.com</a>.</p>
<p>We then used the <a href="https://pikaso.me/api">Pikaso API</a> to screenshot each individual tweet.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<p>We have no plans to keep this archive up to date after the initial release.
However, if you are interested in doing so, you can use <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a>.
You can even <a href="https://pikaso.me/automate">automate</a> it so that each time he tweets, an automatic screenshot is taken.</p>
