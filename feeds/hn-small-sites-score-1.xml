<p>Have you ever wondered which pages people look at once they have landed on your site? How do they navigate? The same questions go for designing a new digital product. How do people click through your prototype? How do they navigate and interact with the designed solution? </p>



<p>If you are conducting a UX study, you can turn to <strong>Useberry </strong>for answers!</p>



<p>In this post, I want to show you a very cool feature called <strong>User Flow.</strong></p>



<p>With Useberry’s <strong>User Flow</strong> report you can learn about the path a visitor takes before reaching its destination while you are in the prototype phase of the design.</p>



<p>But, first things first.<br></p>



<h3>What is User Flow?</h3>



<p>User Flow visualizes the path a user follows from one screen to the next. It helps you understand the behavior of your users, how they interact with your prototype, and create a conversion funnel for it.</p>



<p>In other words, it is a graphical representation of which screens users utilize to complete a specific task, how they move around your prototype, and, most importantly, which screens they’re on when they decide to leave.</p>



<p>Let’s say a user lands on the “Home” screen, goes to the “About” screen, and then to “Contact Us” before leaving.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The user path would then be <strong>Home -&gt; About -&gt; Contact Us.</strong></p></div>



<h3>Why is this important?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The User Flow report can indicate specific points where testers remained longer or got stuck perhaps and help you make changes to enhance the user experience. The easier testers can navigate through your prototype and complete your task, the happier visitors to your final product they’ll become.</p>



<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of how testers are interacting with your prototype can help you optimize your screens for maximum conversions.</p>



<p>This means that you’ll be able to see if there are any specific screens that made users leave your test/prototype. Once these screens have been recognized and then altered with more appropriate or engaging content, you can go back to the User Flow report to check if the number of drop-offs has declined.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You know what you want and like, but to be effective in the UX industry you need to understand the desires of your prospective users.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Understanding the preferences of your target audience is the first step in optimizing your design for conversions. Your aim is to make it easy for your target audience to find and purchase your products and services.<br></p>



<p>Here are just a few of the user behaviors you can learn about with the User Flow report:</p>



<ul><li>Which paths do your testers favor?&nbsp;</li><li>Which screens have the highest drop-off rate?</li></ul>







<h2>What do they look like?</h2>



<p>If you are familiar with the Google Analytics User Flows then you have an idea of how complex (or simple) a User Flow might look.</p>

<h2>How to use User Flow Report in Useberry</h2>



<p>Now that you know what User Flow is and why it’s important, let’s see how you can find and use the report in Useberry and in your designs.</p>



<p>The best way to explain something is with an <strong>example</strong>.</p>



<p>So, let’s create a simple prototype of a music app and monitor how our potential users interact with/navigate through it in order to complete a simple task.</p>



<p>In the following example, we have a “simple” scenario.</p>



<p>We asked 10 testers to “<strong>Add a track to their wish list</strong>”.</p>



<p>The path that the users “should” take and where they “should” click in order to complete the task appears in the screenshot.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-300x78.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Expected path users must follow to complete the task</figcaption></figure>



<p>The whole prototype that we are using appears in the following screenshot:</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we created the prototype with <strong>Figma</strong> for which we used the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Useberry plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/788799088384104964/Useberry" target="_blank">Useberry plugin</a></strong>.<br></p>



<p><strong>Let’s start our test:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorites list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in Useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: People from a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/</a><br></p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png 865w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-300x162.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-768x415.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"></a></figure></div>



<p>OK, we have 60% success in the single task which means that 4 of our users couldn’t complete the task successfully.</p>



<p><strong>But WHY is this the case? </strong></p>



<p><strong>It was so obvious what they had to do, you might think.<br></strong></p>



<p>Let’s focus on the single task now and look at the results:<br></p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png 872w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-300x243.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-768x623.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px"></a></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png 891w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-768x272.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Ok, we can see that 4 users skipped the task.<br></p>



<p>Now, we have 2 options:</p>



<ul><li>Filter the results and watch the session recording of the specific users</li><li>View the user flow and find the pain area </li></ul>



<p>With 10 testers it’s easy to monitor the session recording of 4 users but <strong>on a larger scale</strong> – what would happen if we had more than 100 users?</p>



<p>So, let’s examine the User Flow in order to better understand what happened.</p>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<p>Lines and Curves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Useberry’s User Flow of the test</figcaption></figure>



<p>This looks a bit complex (or not!) but let’s analyze it anyhow.</p>



<p>Let’s <strong>zoom in</strong> a little bit and explain what we can see here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-300x209.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-768x535.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Think of the User Flow as a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every <strong>cell</strong> is an <strong>incremental navigation</strong> <strong>step</strong> and every <strong>row</strong> is a <strong>screen that appeared</strong> on the specific navigation step.</p>



<p>We then <strong>group unique screens with unique navigation steps</strong> and we create the User Flow.</p>



<p>Next to every screen, you will notice a number, and some screens may have a colored number below them. </p>



<p>The number next to the screen is the number of unique users who landed on the specific screen and the number below the screen is an event. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png 662w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here at Useberry, we capture 3 different events:</p>



<p><strong>Yellow event (Skip):</strong> Number of users who skipped the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Blue event (Success):</strong> Number of users who completed the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Red event (Drop-off):</strong> Number of users who dropped-off (totally closed) the test on the specific step.</p>







<p>Now, let’s go back to our example and the results that we have obtained.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Click the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our User Flow example, we can see that we have <strong>multiple paths</strong> that users followed to complete their task.</p>



<p>(In this specific example, we don’t have users that closed the test before it ended which is why we don’t have red events.)</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the User Flow, we realize that we have 4 different screens that have events under them, which means that we have 4 different flows.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>click image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Optimal Path</strong></p>



<p>Clicking the”Optimal path” button we can see the most common flow that users took in order to complete their task.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Optimal path</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Oh, wait…</strong></p>



<p>Those are the users that skipped the task!</p>



<blockquote><p>The “top path” is the most common user flow. It’s the series of screens seen by your typical tester. Every app has one. But not every designer knows what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Namely,  4 users took the <strong>exact specific path</strong> and these users skipped the task after they landed on a specific screen.</p>



<p>Bearing in mind the expected path and seeing that the optimal path is not the same as the expected path, we can <strong>quickly</strong> figure out that we need to modify our design in order to increase the success of the test.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s go a little deeper, though</strong>.</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the screen where testers split, we can see that that’s where we need to focus.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png 668w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a><figcaption>Click on the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have 8 users who landed on <strong>screen A</strong> and 2 users who landed on <strong>screen B</strong>. On our expected path, the <strong>screen B</strong> is the “expected” screen. The users <strong>MUST</strong> go there in order to complete the task. </p>



<p>So, we have two options – change our design in order to lead these 8 users to <strong>screen B</strong> or design “something” on <strong>screen A</strong> to satisfy our users.</p>



<p>Now let’s see where the users clicked and <strong>why they split</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>How?</strong> </p>



<p>Just click “View Heatmaps” on the specific screen.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png 603w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption><br>By clicking heatmaps on a screen you will see where the users clicked when they were on the specific screen and the specific path step</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png 400w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1-156x300.png 156w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Aha… Interesting! </strong></p>



<p>It seems that our testers and our potential users, in order to add a track to their wish list, first navigate through the specific track. (makes sense!)</p>



<p>Well, a possible solution to this is to satisfy our users when they land on <strong>screen B</strong>. That’s why we changed the design and added a bar with the “add to wishlist” button on the specific screen and run a new test again.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png" alt="" width="580" height="482" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-768x638.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png 1063w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a><figcaption>Before – After</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorite list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: From a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/</a></p>



<p>And the results of the <strong>new </strong>test are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png 866w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-768x637.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></figure></div>

<p><strong>Amazing!</strong> We actually increased our conversions!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We managed to find an issue in something we thought was obvious and we resolved it quickly with the help of the user-flows. </p>



<p>Running tests in the design phase helps you save time and effort and solve UX issues that never even occurred to you before.</p>



<p>Maybe the results of the test are obvious but this is just a demo and an example in order to explain what user-flow looks like and how it can help you resolve UX issues.</p>



<p>With more complex prototypes and more testers, the user-flow becomes more complex, too, but we are trying to add features to make it as friendly as we possibly can – it’s up to you if you want to dig into it.</p>



<p>So, happy designing and feel free to come forward with any suggestions!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/vedikaja_in">Vedika Jain</a> on Jan 26, 2021</p><figure id="w-node-171a34cb3a83-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600efa2918ec99dd6420c81a_Screenshot%202021-01-25%20at%2017.01.51.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Weekend Fund is a two-person distributed team. Ryan is based in LA. I’m based in London. We work on the internet. </p><p>There has been a lot of “micro fund” chat on the internet: <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/24/how-rolling-funds-could-rock-vc/">The rise of rolling funds</a>, <a href="https://thecuriousinvestor.substack.com/p/rolling-funds-and-the-rise-of-the">the rise of Micro LPs</a>, <a href="https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists">The Rise of the Solo Capitalists</a>…</p><p>But little has been shared about how funds like ours operate, and how we aim to: </p><ul role="list"><li>Be the highest helpfulness to check-size ratio investor to our portfolio founders. One of our portfolio founders Harry Hurst tweeted about the concept <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhurst/status/1280165358255538179">here</a>. </li><li>Invest in the best early-stage deals partnering with founders early and driving returns </li><li>Be the best possible fund manager to our LPs: trusted, communicative and high-performing</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Jeff Lawson, the founder and CEO of Twilio, said this about strategy on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VHi9azzFenfH4R9SlBHqT?si=nsqv1LKhRa64c5vr1Lqs4Q">Bessemer Venture Partners Cloud Giants Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>I often say that strategy is a dirty word in business; it should be struck. Any time you find yourself talking about strategy, you’re probably off-course, actually. There’s only one business strategy: serve your customers.</blockquote><p>I agree with that. In venture, I think there’s only one core strategy: serving founders in a differentiated way. We’ve implemented workflows made up of tools, automations and habits to optimize our limited time to create leverage to serve founders.</p><p>Let’s break this down.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Spark</h3><p>Investors spend a lot of time in their inbox. 😅 </p><p>Here’s what makes Spark the best email tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Shared drafts:</strong> We use each other as a second pair of eyes to review email drafts including offers to invest in companies, deal-flow sharing with other investors and diligence follow-ups. Spark has a collaborative real-time editor that speeds up making edits before sending a draft. </li><li><strong>Spark templates:</strong> We use Spark templates to quickly share details about portfolio companies with other investors when helping founders with their fundraise.</li><li><strong>In-email private chat:</strong> We use this to make quick decisions about the email we receive. This includes cold email, deal-flow from other investors and admin/scheduling.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-37c75a60536c-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600dfe86a1d3df2e88f92e31_spark-chat.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Airtable</h3><p>Airtable is the central storage for all information on deal flow, investments, and people in our network.</p><p>Here’s what makes Airtable the best tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Flexible:</strong> It’s flexible enough for us to store anything. We store a lot. </li><li><strong>Relational:</strong> You’ve probably heard that investors are in the relationship business. Relational databases like Airtable aren’t just about storing data, they store relationships between data. This helps us see links between the companies, deals, founders, investors, funds, and more in the WF universe. </li><li><strong>Integration friendly:</strong> It integrates with other tools to make all types of workflows that power the fund.</li></ul><p>Our Airtable “base” includes three primary tables:</p><p><strong>Companies</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We manage our Pipeline through an “Active Pipeline” view which filters companies we are meeting, diligencing or going to pass on. We also have a Missed view, a Tracking view, a Markups view and more to help us sort through companies. </li><li>We automatically capture pipeline entry and exit dates to track how fast we’re responding to founders. We try to get back to founders with a 7 day “SLA”. </li><li>We also record who introduced us to every deal sourced through an introduction. This links to our People table enriching our CRM. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>People</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>This includes founders, investors and others who have introduced us to companies. The table is designed to surface the context of our relationship: i.e for investors, it would surface which deals we’ve co-invested in, which deals they introduced us to, etc. </li><li>We have a “Warm Angel and Small Fund” view we use to share deals with angels + small funds we’re collaborating most with. </li><li>We also have a “Top Introducers” view that filters top introducers based on the # of deals + portfolio companies they’ve introduced us to.</li></ul><p><strong>VC Firms</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We use this table to capture who is investing at VC firms (linked of course to the People table), and what stages, categories, check sizes they invest in, and if they lead rounds. </li><li>Like our People table, we have a “Warm VC Firms” table we use to share deals with the firms that are most collaborative. It’s also helpful for identifying firms that might be best suited for a particular company based on their stage and market focus. </li><li>What makes this table especially useful for deal-sharing is the subjective context we capture in notes and often share with founders before making introductions. Here’s what a note would look like “Coatue is one of the most data-driven firms and Mazzeo’s one of the most energetic, product-minded investors I know.” Yes, that is a real example.</li></ul><p>🎁 Here’s a digital goodie: <a href="https://airtable.com/shr5i9tJSUl7ob7CY/tblbr0WwfLMZ1a9Mc/viwZ1sYZ9ripf5Ft4?blocks=hide">Template from our Airtable</a></p><figure id="w-node-0a3d187f3df2-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600ee65b3b6b23278218888b_Screenshot%202021-01-25%20at%2015.40.25.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Zapier</h3><p>We automate as much as possible not just to save time, but also to not miss any steps in our processes. We want to be working on the right things, the right way. &nbsp;</p><p>Zaps we have running right now:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Deal channel creation zap: </strong>We have a Zap that automatically creates a deal channel in Slack for every deal we’re meeting from Airtable. More on that below. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a></li><li><strong>7-day SLA zap:</strong> We have a Zap that sets up a reminder to follow up 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline. This helps us ensure that we get back to every founder in a reasonable time. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a> (last 2 steps in template)</li><li><strong>Tracking zap:</strong> We have another Zap to follow up on companies we’re tracking. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/71703611e82231e90d81e13e60cd722dc5aad259">Template here</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Slack</h3><p>Slack works well for our working style at Weekend Fund. Here’s how we use it for deals:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Our deal creation Zap (as mentioned above) automatically creates a Slack channel for every company we’re meeting</li><li>We consolidate materials/context in the channel before every pitch call </li><li>We share questions for the founder in the channel before every pitch to ensure we’re well prepared </li><li>Debrief + decide next steps immediately after call </li><li>The 7 day SLA Zap goes off in the channel 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline </li><li>We close the channel only after we close the investment or send the pass email + “close the loop” email updating the person who introduced us to the deal</li></ol><p>In addition to deal channels, we have a few more to organize our communications:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>#deal-outbound:</strong> Vedika is using this channel to build a habit of outbound deal sourcing starting with 1x deal a day </li><li><strong>#experiments:</strong> As early stage becomes even more competitive, it feels even more important for us to run experiments. We’ve run experiments like Weekend Build, Fundraise From Home, and are working on our next one. This is the channel we use for experiments related chat. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>#shower-thoughts:</strong> This is a creative safe space where we discuss “What if we tried this?” ideas.</li></ul><p>At the time of this post, we have 25 Slack channels open. This might sound silly for a two-person team, but we’ve found this organization helpful in our communications. Our slack history is a searchable artifact for the years to come.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Vimcal</h3><p>The newest tool in our stack is Vimcal, the calendar app we use for scheduling. Here’s why we use it:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Timezone juggling: </strong>As a distributed team jumping on calls with founders around the world, we do a lot of scheduling across timezones. Vimcal is the best tool we’ve found for this.</li><li><strong>Efficient, but still personal:</strong> Gets us the efficiency of booking links without the risk of it coming off as transactional</li></ul><figure id="w-node-501f9f458622-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600e0104afcfe91478eedf7c_vimcal-gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>AngelList Venture Funds</h3><p>AngelList makes it possible for a small team (or single person) to run a venture fund. They provide:</p><ul role="list"><li>Operational support to execute deals - reviewing + signing legal docs and wiring funds</li><li>Tax reporting and accounting overhead </li><li>Capital calls and other LP management </li><li>A dashboard with investment and fund performance data (use <a href="https://angel.co/v/venture/calculator">this calculator</a> to see how your fund performs in comparison to others)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Share Your Stack</h3><p>This is our stack at a high level. There’s a lot more we do behind the scenes, and we’re always thinking about ways to improve our workflows, automations and habits. </p><p>While we don’t expect other fund managers to copy our way of working 100%, we’re hoping that sharing our stack and workflows will be useful for other emerging fund managers. </p><p>If you’re a fund manger, we’d love to see the stack powering your fund on Twitter. Tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/vedikaja_in">@vedikaja_in</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Thanks to Ryan Hoover, Varadh Jain and Liam Moore for reading drafts of this.</em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/bytedance">ByteDance</a> is reduces the size and number of its TikTok team in India few months after its was banned by the Indian government.</p>
<p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/india">India</a> is one of TikTok’s most prominent markets.</p>
<p>In June, India’s Ministry of Information Technology had blocked 59 Chinese apps claiming they were “engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defense of India, security of state and public order.”</p>
<p>TikTok was part of them. Since that period, the apps have been blocked, this had led <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> parent, ByteDance, to announce workforce reduction on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tiktok claimed they have steadfastly worked to adhere to the Indian order from June, saying there is lack of feedback from the government on how the issue is to be resolved in the subsequent 7 months.</p>
<p>Interim head of TikTok, Vanessa Pappas, said the company has “worked tirelessly to prevent having to separate anyone from the company,” from the internal memo sent to employees in India as stated by <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/tiktok-reduces-workforce-in-india-but-no-plans-of-shutting-down-1763184-2021-01-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">India Today</a>.</p>
<p>They lamented that they simply cannot responsibly operate with full staff while their apps remain un-operational</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-300x168.jpg" alt="Tiktok Reduces Staff In India" width="371" height="208" srcset="https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-300x168.jpg 300w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-768x430.jpg 768w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-678x381.jpg 678w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"><br>
TikTok will “only retain a small number of key roles in India,” as stated in a separate internal memo which was sent to global employees by Pappas.</p>
<p>Pappas said prospects in other countries has remained absolutely rigid — these issues were pertaining to political challenge in India.”</p>
<p>In September, India had banned another set of 118 Chinese apps. All the apps have remained blocked and the Times of India had reported on Tuesday that many more, with the possibilty of TikTok too, will be totally banned.</p>
<p>The app bans were viewed as a retaliation to flaring tensions with China over their disputed Himalayan mountain border in Ladakh, which had resulted the deaths of not less than 20 Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>Ji Rong, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in India, has alleged that the Indian govt’s intent to totally ban the apps violates the WTO’s “non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy.” and hopes that the Indian side will abruptly correct its discriminatory measures and prevent cause of more damage to bilateral cooperation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> Scientists at EPFL have discovered that Alzheimer’s-like protein aggregates underly the muscle deterioration seen in aging. But the aggregates can be reversed by boosting the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), which turns on the defense systems of mitochondria in cells and restores muscle function.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>The older we grow, the weaker our muscles get, riddling old age with frailty and physical disability. But this doesn’t only affect the individual, it also creates a significant burden on public healthcare. And yet, research efforts into the biological processes and biomarkers that define muscle aging have not yet defined the underlying causes.</p><p>Now, a team of scientists from lab of Johan Auwerx at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences looked at the issue through a different angle: the similarities between muscle aging and degenerative muscle diseases. They have discovered protein aggregates that deposit in skeletal muscles during natural aging, and that blocking this can prevent the detrimental features of muscle aging. The study is <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31649-1">published in <em>Cell Reports</em></a>.</p><p>“During age-associated muscle diseases, such as inclusion body myositis (IBM), our cells struggle to maintain correct protein folding, leading these misfolded proteins to precipitate and forming toxic protein aggregates within the muscles,” explains Auwerx. “The most prominent component of these protein aggregates is beta-amyloid, just like in the amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.”</p><p>In the study, the scientists identify amyloid-like protein aggregates in aged muscles from different species, from the nematode <em>C. elegans</em> all the way to humans. In addition, they also found that these aggregates also impair mitochondrial function. Although aggregated proteins have been suggested to contribute to brain aging, this is the first time that they have been shown to contribute to muscle aging and to directly damage mitochondria. “These abnormal proteotoxic aggregates could serve as novel biomarkers for the aging process, beyond the brain and muscle,” says Auwerx.</p><p>But can the formation of the protein aggregates be reversed? To answer this, the researchers fed worms the vitamin nicotinamide riboside and the antitumor agent Olaparib, both of which boost the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), a biomolecule that is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, and whose levels decline during aging.</p><p>In the worms, the two compounds turned on the defense systems of the mitochondria, even when provided at advanced age. Turning on the so-called “mitochondrial quality control system” reduced the age-related amyloid protein aggregates and improved the worms’ fitness and lifespan.</p><p>The scientists then moved on to human muscle tissue, taken from aged subjects and IBM patients. Turning on the same mitochondrial quality control systems produced similar improvements in protein and mitochondrial homeostasis. The encouraging results led the researchers to test nicotinamide riboside in aged mice. The treatment also activated the mitochondrial defense systems and reduced the number and size of amyloid aggregates in different skeletal muscle tissues.</p><p>“Drugs that boost mitochondrial quality control could therefore be tested in the clinic to reverse these age-related proteotoxic aggregates and rejuvenate tissues,” says Mario Romani, the first author of the study.</p><p><strong>Other contributors</strong></p><ul><li>CHA University</li><li>Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology</li><li>Chungnam National University School of Medicine</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The Value of Targeted Advertising]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>This post will might be the post that will roast me the most. But before triggering your fingers just by reading the title I would like everyone to read my post, and read my argument before jumping in to conclusions.</p>
<h2>As developers, techies we all hate ads but…</h2>
<p>Yes, developers like you and me love user privacy, we like to use only usernames on forums, we don’t like services making it mandatory to give our real names, photos etc. </p>
<p>Same goes for advertising, we all hate to see ads, we all dislike the experience of seeing lots of ads on a website, ads make websites load slow, use our data/bandwidth. </p>
<p>We just want to go to a website, get what we came there, and get out. Trust me I’m no different from you, I also hate annoying ads, I also hate ads as much as you do. </p>
<p>But most average users don’t mind to see an ad or two on a website, they don’t mind services like Facebook and its companies, Google, and other advertising networking tracking them throughout the internet. They are happy to get a free service, in exchange of their data, tracking, and some ads in between.</p>
<h2>As a developer, marketer</h2>
<p>We all love making new things, we all want to see our tools and products to be used by as many people as possible. <a href="https://ruky.me/2021/01/26/do-you-believe-in-fail-fast-and-fail-quickly/" data-type="post" data-id="236">No one likes to start a failed startup, or launch a failed product.</a></p>
<p>Advertising is a great way to get the word out about your product to the internet. You can reach more people through online advertising, by spending the same amount than posting an ad on the a newspaper or TV.</p>
<p>Not only that targeted online advertising ads more value to the money you spend. A newspaper ad or a TV ad is like firing randomly hoping you will hit as many targets as possible. </p>
<p>But a targeted online ad is more likely to get impressions of people who are most likely to use your product (Facebook), or more likely potential users searching for a product like yours (Google).So you get more value to the money you spend as an advertiser or creator.</p>
<p>Even if your product is a premium product that doesn’t require advertising, you will still have to rely on advertisements to get the word out about your product.</p>
<h2>As a publisher</h2>
<p>Running a website, or app can be expensive, you need to pay for the servers, you need to pay for the developer tools (Apple developer license), even if it’s an open source tool, you spend you time </p>
<p>If you are providing a free service, advertising is a great way to cover development cost, server costs. Yes you can depend on donations, but still that may not make enough money, or users might use the product more than they donate. </p>
<p>For example, how many people would be willing to pay $50 USD per month? Do people think Facebook is providing them a value of $50 USD per month? Most people will say no, even I don’t think Facebook is giving me a value around $50 USD per month.</p>
<p>But people like using Facebook, and use Facebook for free, but Facebook will have to pay for their data centres, their developers, and other costs.</p>
<p>And also even though there will be some people who will donate some amount for the development of Facebook, the amount of donations will not be able to cover development costs.</p>
<p>So even though as annoying as it can be, some services will have to depend on ad revenue to cover their costs and make a profit in return.</p>
<h2>As a user</h2>
<p>Imagine you go to a website, you will be shown an ad that is something totally unrelated to you? Ever visited a torrent website, and you are greeted with an ad to an adult website? Isn’t that annoying? </p>
<p>Won’t you rather enjoy a high quality targeted ad on Facebook, rather than seeing some non targeted random ad, totally unrelated. A targeted ad can give a better experience for the user, and also a money well spent for the advertiser.</p>
<h2>Why we need minimally invasive tracking</h2>
<p>In order to do this, there has to have some level tracking for ad services, let that be cookies, pixels, super-cookies, there needs to be some sort of minimally invasive tracking to serve targeted, and therefore a good ad experience.</p>
<p>As developers, startup creators, won’t you like to spend money to get the word out about your startup or product to the most relevant people? or spend that money to getting your product to random set of users.</p>
<p>Isn’t that the same reason why we share our creations on HackerNews, ProductHunt than some unrelated cooking subreddit? Because we all understand the value of a good audience.</p>
<p>A targeted ad is a method where all parties, publishers, advertisers, users all will benefit.</p>
<p>So next time when you criticise targeting, and privacy, we all need to remember that we won’t be able to get out word out, publishers and some services won’t be able to make revenue without advertising. </p>
<p>Now roast me with your opinions.</p>

<p>Everyone wants pepperoni except for the one person who hates pepperoni. So you don’t get pepperoni, because nobody else cares enough to tell that one person to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">shove it</a>.</p>



<p>Everyone wants to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">try</a> switching to 3-week sprints except for that one person who thinks 3 weeks is way too long. So you stick with 2-week <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">sprints</a>, because nobody else cares enough to tell that one person to shove it.</p>



<p>Interesting how we give that one noisy dissenter so much power. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/21/when-and-why-do-you-concede/">Human politeness</a> is a powerful motivator. We choose to make a large group of people slightly unhappier to prevent a small group (or even a single person) from being <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">significantly unhappier</a>. </p>



<p>The majority <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">doesn’t care enough</a> to tell the minority to deal with it, so the minority gets veto power. I recently heard this called <em>the tyranny of the minority</em>, but that seems harsh. It reminds me of one of my all-time favorite quotes:</p>



<blockquote><p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</p><cite>George Bernard Shaw</cite></blockquote>



<p>Is it tyranny to be “unreasonable”? No. It’s necessary. The <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/17/values-pick-2/">quality</a> that makes a person put their foot down about pizza toppings is the same quality that drives progress. </p>



<p>What is that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/22/blind-spots-and-bright-spots/">quality</a>? Grit? Stubbornness? Determination? Vision? <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">Courage</a>? All of those?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>Don't be afraid.</p>


<p>One thing I'm known for at work is reading research papers, and referring to results in technical conversations. People ask me if, and how, they should read papers themselves. This post is a long-form answer to that question. The intended audience is working software engineers.</p>

<p><strong>Why read research?</strong></p>

<p>I read research in one of three mental modes.</p>

<p>The first mode is <em>solution finding</em>: I’m faced with a particular problem, and am looking for solutions. This isn’t too different from the way that you probably use Stack Overflow, but for more esoteric or systemic problems. Solution finding can work directly from papers, but I tend to find books more useful in this mode, unless I know an area well and am looking for something specific.</p>

<p>A more productive mode is what I call <em>discovery</em>. In this case, I’ve been working on a problem or in a space, and know something about it. In discovery mode, I want to explore around the space I know and see if there are better solutions. For example, when I was building a system using Paxos, I read a lot of literature about consensus protocols in general (including classics like <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf">Viewstamped Replication</a><sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, and newer papers like Raft). The goal in discovery mode is to find alternative solutions, opportunities for optimization, or new ways to think about a problem.</p>

<p>The most intellectually gratifying mode for me is <em>curiosity</em> mode. Here, I’ll read papers that just seem interesting to me, but aren’t related to anything I’m currently working on. I’m constantly surprised by how reading broadly has helped me solve problems, or just informed by approach. For example, reading about misuse-resistant cryptography primitives like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452">GCM-SIV</a> has deeply informed my approach to API design. Similarly, reading about erasure codes around 2005 helped me solve an important problem for my team just this year.</p>

<p>I’ve found reading for discovery and curiosity very helpful to my career. It has also given me tools that makes reading for solution finding more efficient. Sometimes, reading for curiosity leads to new paths. About five years ago I completely changed what I was working on after reading <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1022594.1022596">Latency lags bandwidth</a>, which I believe is one of the most important trends in computing.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need a degree to read research papers?</strong></p>

<p>No. Don’t expect to be able to pick up every paper and understand it completely. You do need a certain amount of background knowledge, but no credentials. Try to avoid being discouraged when you don't understand a paper, or sections of a paper. I'm often surprised when I revisit something after a couple years and find I now understand it.</p>

<p>Learning a new field from primary research can be very difficult. When tackling a new area, books, blogs, talks, and courses are better options.</p>

<p><strong>How do I find papers worth reading?</strong></p>

<p>That depends on the mode you’re in. In <em>solution finding</em> and <em>discovery</em> modes, search engines like Google Scholar are a great place to start. One challenge with searching is that you might not even know the right things to search for: it’s not unusual for researchers to use different terms from the ones you are used to. If you run into this problem, picking up a book on the topic can often help bridge the gap, and the references in books are a great way to discover papers.</p>

<p>Following particular authors and researchers can be great for <em>discovery</em> and <em>curiosity</em> modes. If there’s a researcher who’s working in a space I’m interested in, I’ll follow them on Twitter or add search alerts to see when they’ve published something new.</p>

<p>Conferences and journals are another great place to go. Most of the computer science research you’ll read is probably published at conferences. There are some exceptions. For example, I followed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tos">ACM Transactions on Storage</a> when I was working in that area. Pick a couple of conferences in areas that you’re interested in, and read through their programs when they come out. In my area, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/technical-sessions">NSDI</a> and <a href="https://www.eurosys2020.org/program/">Eurosys</a> happened earlier this year, and OSDI is coming up. Jeff Huang has a <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards.html">nice list of best paper winners</a> at a wide range of CS conferences.</p>

<p>A lot of research involves going through the graph of references. Most papers include a list of references, and as I read I note down which ones I’d like to follow up on and add them to my reading list. References form a directed (mostly) acyclic graph of research going into the past.</p>

<p>Finally, some research bloggers are worth following. <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/">Adrian Colyer's blog</a> is worth its weight in gold. I’ve written about research from researchers from <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/03/30/lamport-pub.html">Leslie Lamport</a>, <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/05/10/lynch-pub.html">Nancy Lynch</a> and others, too.</p>

<p><strong>That’s quite a fire hose! How do I avoid drowning?</strong></p>

<p>You don’t have to drink that whole fire hose. I know I can’t. Titles and abstracts can be a good way to filter out papers you want to read. Don’t be afraid to scan down a list of titles and pick out one or two papers to read.</p>

<p>Another approach is to avoid reading new papers at all. Focus on the classics, and let time filter out papers that are worth reading. For example, I often find myself recommending Jim Gray's 1986 paper on <a href="https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/tandem/TR-86.1.pdf">The 5 Minute Rule</a> and Lisanne Bainbridge's 1983 paper on <a href="https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bainbridge_1983_Automatica.pdf">Ironies of Automation</a><sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Who writes research papers?</strong></p>

<p>Research papers in the areas of computer science I work in are generally written by one of three groups. First, researchers at universities, including professors, post docs, and graduate students. These are people who’s job it is to do research. They have a lot of freedom to explore quite broadly, and do foundational and theoretical work.</p>

<p>Second, engineering teams at companies publish their work. Amazon’s <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/agache">Firecracker</a>, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/p1041-verbitski.pdf">Aurora</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Physalia</a> papers are examples. Here, work is typically more directly aimed at a problem to be solved in a particular context. The strength of industry research is that it’s often been proven in the real world, at scale.</p>

<p>In the middle are industrial research labs. Bell Labs was home to some of the foundational work in computing and communications. Microsoft Research do a great deal of impressive work. Industry labs, as a broad generalization, also tend to focus on concrete problems, but can operate over longer time horizons.</p>

<p><strong>Should I trust the results in research papers?</strong></p>

<p>The right answer to this question is <em>no</em>. Nothing about being in a research paper guarantees that a result is right. Results can range from simply wrong, to flawed in more subtle ways<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the process of peer review does help set a bar of quality for published results, and results published in reputable conferences and journals are generally trustworthy. Reviewers and editors put a great deal of effort into this, and it’s a real strength of scientific papers over informal publishing.</p>

<p>My general advice is to read methods carefully, and verify results for yourself if you’re going to make critical decisions based on them. A common mistake is to apply a correct result too broadly, and assume it applies to contexts or systems it wasn’t tested on.</p>

<p><strong>Should I distrust results that aren’t in research papers?</strong></p>

<p>No. The process of peer review is helpful, but not magical. Results that haven’t been peer reviewed, or rejected from peer review aren’t necessarily wrong. Some important papers have been rejected from traditional publishing, and were published in other ways. This <a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-paxos">happened</a> to Leslie Lamport's classic paper introducing Paxos:</p>

<blockquote><p>I submitted the paper to TOCS in 1990.  All three referees said that the paper was mildly interesting, though not very important, but that all the Paxos stuff had to be removed.  I was quite annoyed at how humorless everyone working in the field seemed to be, so I did nothing with the paper.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was eventually published 8 years later, and quite well received:</p>

<blockquote><p>This paper won an ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award in 2012.</p></blockquote>

<p>There's a certain dance one needs to know, and follow, to get published in a top conference or journal. Some of the steps are necessary, and lead to better research and better communities. Others are just for show.</p>

<p><strong>What should I look out for in the methods section?</strong></p>

<p>That depends on the field. In distributed systems, one thing to look out for is scale. Due to the constraints of research, systems may be tested and validated at a scale below what you’ll need to run in production. Think carefully about how the scale assumptions in the paper might impact the results. Both academic and industry authors have an incentive to talk up the strengths of their approach, and avoid highlighting the weaknesses. This is very seldom done to the point of dishonesty, but worth paying attention to as you read.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get time to read?</strong></p>

<p>This is going to depend on your personal circumstances, and your job. It's not always easy. Long-term learning is one of the keys to a sustainable and successful career, so it's worth making time to learn. One of the ways I like to learn is by reading research papers. You might find other ways more efficient, effective or enjoyable. That's OK too.</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>

<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/penberg">Pekka Enberg</a> pointed me at <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf">How to Read a Paper</a> by Srinivasan Keshav. It describes a three-pass approach to reading a paper that I like very much:</p>

<blockquote><p>The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Murat Demirbas shared his post <a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-i-read-research-paper.html">How I Read a Research Paper</a> which contains a lot of great advice. Like Murat, I like to read on paper, although I have taken to doing my lighter-weight reading using <a href="https://www.liquidtext.net/">LiquidText</a></p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> I wrote a <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/05/19/vr.html">blog post about Viewstamped Replication</a> back in 2014. It's a pity VR isn't more famous, because it's an interestingly different framing that helped me make sense of a lot of what Paxos does.</li>
<li><a name="foot2"></a> Obviously stuff like maths is timeless, but even in fast-moving fields like systems there are papers worth reading from the 50s and 60s. I think about Sayre's 1969 paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/363626.363629">Is automatic “folding” of programs efficient enough to displace manual?</a> when people talk about how modern programmers …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>

<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>

<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p><a href="https://console.dev/">Console</a> is starting as a free weekly newsletter highlighting the best tools for developers. We want to know how our list is performing, which means keeping an eye on some key metrics like active subscribers and unsubscribe rates. We can log into Mailchimp to see this data, but I wanted to get a quick daily update rather than forming a habit of constantly logging in.</p><p>We <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">default to asynchronous communication</a> and use the chat room built into <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for informal socialising or posting non-critical links and comments. I check it each morning, so it seemed like a good place to post a status update.</p><p>Like most chat products <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api/blob/master/sections/chatbots.md#create-a-line">Basecamp has a bot API</a> to send arbitrary messages into the chat. It is therefore easy to use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/fundamentals/">the Mailchimp API</a> to <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/get-list-info/">pull the stats</a> and post them into Basecamp. This code just needs to run every morning.</p><p>Keeping <a href="https://blog.console.dev/console-tech-stack-2021/">our tech stack</a> as simple as possible is a priority. We don't have a complex product and dealing with servers, OS updates, database replication, etc is something we will put off as long as possible! However, a chat bot has to run somewhere. This is the perfect use-case for a serverless function - just write the code and let the platform deal with the infrastructure maintenance.</p><h2 id="azure-vs-google-vs-aws">Azure vs Google vs AWS</h2><p>I have <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/who-has-the-best-serverless-platform/">tried AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions</a>, and have several personal utility functions running on both Google and Azure. Whilst I have been impressed with Google Cloud's database products, they are still behind when it comes to the breadth of functionality in their serverless functions product. Google doesn't support Rust and has no concept of custom runtimes like AWS and Azure do.</p><p>This meant it was down to AWS vs Azure. Both have excellent documentation, lots of language SDKs, and a large ecosystem of developers. However, I prefer the Azure web portal, like how they build in public on GitHub, and <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/fighting-over-who-has-the-greenest-public-cloud/">rate them best for environmental sustainability</a>. AWS is the more popular platform and Lambda/Azure Functions are competitive. I just prefer Azure.</p><h2 id="creating-a-python-serverless-bot">Creating a Python serverless bot</h2><p>I have been writing Python for over 10 years, so it was the default choice to create a simple serverless bot. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python">Azure has native Python support</a>, the Basecamp API takes a simple HTTP POST, and <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/mailchimp-marketing-python">Mailchimp has an official Python SDK</a>. </p><p>This meant that within a few hours I had written a function, created the Azure Resource Manager template, and configured GitHub Actions to automatically deploy on push.

With some extra time, particularly in the quiet period between Christmas and New Year, I ended up spending several days playing around with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>Although it has been around since 2010, Rust has become particularly popular in the last few years. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">Stack Overflow have listed it as the most loved language</a> since 2016.</p><p>I won't go into the standard Rust pitch of "better safety, concurrency, performance" - you can find detailed Rust <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2">vs</a> Language X <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/5/27/rust-for-pythonistas/">posts</a> <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go">elsewhere</a> - but I did want to write up my experience as a Rust newbie.</p><h3 id="reason-1-fun-and-interesting">Reason 1: Fun and interesting</h3><p>My main reason for porting from Python to Rust was that it was fun and interesting! I like Python (which sits at #3 in the "most loved" 2020 ranking) because it is easy to start writing code and you can get things done quickly. It also enforces a particular coding style which means more consistent layout, spacing, indenting, etc.</p><p>Python doesn't make you think about concepts like static typing and memory management because it handles it for you. Rust is very different. It forces you to consider types, ensure all return cases are handled consistently, understand scoping, and many other things which are absent in Python. This is by design because it makes the resulting code much more robust.</p><p>Rust uses the concept of "<a href="https://sled.rs/errors">correctness</a>". It's not that Rust is "right" and Python is "wrong", but forcing you think about these concepts, and enforcing them before code will compile, helps to avoid errors:</p><blockquote>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software.<p>- <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-intensive Systems</a></p></blockquote><p>The number of times I have found bugs in my Python code due to silly mistakes like typos or not handling a particular error case makes me appreciate Rust's approach. Better to invest more time in development rather than finding bugs and errors once code has been shipped to production. </p><p>I still need to write more extensive unit tests and mock the external API calls but tests are a core language feature. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html">Developers are encourged</a> to write tests inside the source that is being tested, with integration tests in a "tests" directory.</p><h3 id="reason-2-portability">Reason 2: Portability</h3><p>Neither AWS Lambda nor Azure Functions have native support for Rust, but they both support Custom <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">Runtimes</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other">Handlers</a>. This allows you to build a generic web endpoint which, if it can handle to standard HTTP requests and return a standard HTTP response, can be executed by the platform.</p><p>(This is true for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers#http-only-function">an HTTP triggered function on Azure</a>. Getting into more platform-specific function types, like a Timer or Queue trigger, means relying more on the platform features. This makes it more difficult to port away, but not impossible).</p><p>All languages have a range of frameworks that help building web endpoints, often with an embedded web server. Rust has <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">amongst others</a>. By creating generic HTTP endpoints, the application can be run anywhere. AWS Lambda has <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">some experimental Rust language bindings</a>, but creating a set of generic web endpoints is better because it is not then tied to a specific platform.</p><p>This is not unique to Rust. Python has <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> (or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for a more "batteries included" approach). However, Rust differs because it is a statically compiled language. This means the output is a binary that runs entirely independently, only requiring the system libc implementation. If you <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">compile it with a musl target</a> it becomes 100% static and will therefore run on any Linux OS. </p><p>Statically compiled binaries have all their dependencies included executable. This means the binary should continue to run "forever", even if the platform changes. Indeed, because the application is completely isolated and separate from the platform, there is no reliance on specific system-installed packages. Both can be updated independent of each other. This can be partly achieved using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python Virtual Environments</a>, but they are complex and have developer overhead (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP-0582</a> aims to fix that). Static compilation is a more robust approach.</p><p>It is currently convenient to run this bot on Azure, but it would be trivial to move it to AWS or a generic web server. Using <a href="https://upx.github.io/">upx</a> to <a href="https://github.com/svenstaro/upx-action">compress the executable</a> means the final binary with a full embedded web server is just 2.5MB. This application is so lightweight it could even run on a Raspberry Pi in the office - I'd just need to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compile it for ARM</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 670w"><figcaption>The final 100% static, upx compressed binary. Only 2.5MB.</figcaption></figure><p>This is definitely overkill for a chatbot project. There is no tangible benefit to statically compiling a few hundred lines of Rust vs deploying the same length Python code to Azure Functions. There are only a couple of dependencies! </p><p>But this is a great test project to learn how it works (see Reason #1 above). Internal tools tend to be built quickly and with less polish than software you intend to ship to customers. Yet they often last the longest in production because of how widely used they become. In some organizations it can be hard to justify spending expensive developer time on such projects, so investing in maintainabilty upfront is worth it.</p><h3 id="reason-3-developer-tooling">Reason 3: Developer tooling</h3><p>The overall experience of writing Rust is made much more enjoyable because of the developer tooling. Everything revolves around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a> which makes documentation, dependency management, linting, testing, and builds all part of the core language. Installing Rust using the standard rustup command also includes Cargo and there are several useful extras like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit">Audit</a>.</p><p>This is a big win for developers because everything you need is available out of the box. Third-party packages can be found in the <a href="https://crates.io/">Crate registry</a>. The equivalent in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip">pip</a>, does not feel as slick and wasn't even included with Python when I first started coding it (when setuptools/easy_install were the primary method of package management). You also have to be careful to use a Python virtual environment if you have a system managed installation of Python, otherwise you will end up installing system-level dependencies.</p><p>I'm a vim user so the official <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim">rust.vim plugin</a> gives me autocomplete and in-editor checks, but the output from Cargo (warnings and errors) is very helpful and pinpointing problems. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a> is fun, too.</p><p>Where Python has an advantage is the number of libraries. PyPI has over 280,000 packages whereas Cargo has 53,000. Quantity is not an indication of quality, and Python has been stable longer, but it is reasonable to expect vendors to provide official Python SDKs. That is less common with Rust.</p><h2 id="challenges-learning-rust">Challenges learning Rust</h2><p>I wrote the Python bot in a few hours but it took me several days to get the Rust port working. This would be hard to justify if it wasn't a learning project, but everyone gets faster with experience. I had to learn not just a new language but also how to properly cross-compile for a different platform. Here are my notes on some of those challenges:</p><h3 id="language-challenges">Language challenges</h3><p>There are several features which make Rust robust, safe, and correct, but require a shift in mindset if you're used to other languages.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <div>
              <p><img src="https://danielpecos.com/assets/2021/01/27/SES-MJML.png" alt="SES templates with MJML"></p>
<p>If you are a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses">AWS SES</a> user (AWS’ email system) you probably know that working with its JSON based templates is not a user-friendly task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text and HTML content are defined as properties of a JSON object</li>
<li>It’s a JSON file, meaning that you have to escape some characters, like <code>"</code> in the HTML</li>
<li>It’s quite hard to find the content to change in the HTML being stored in a single line</li>
</ul>
<p>But still, is a quite convenient system, as hosting your own email server is quite an effort, and you want it to be reliable.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to use it, despite the not so friendly interface. Together with a Lambda function triggered by SNS messages, I have managed to build a quite robust mail gateway solution for <a href="https://app.papyro.dplabs.tech/">Papyro</a> (let me know if you are interested in knowing how theses pieces fit together and I’ll write a future post about it).</p>
<p>But the pain of creating some nice looking emails using this system is way too much from the moment that you have to manage more than 3 or 4 email templates.</p>
<p>That’s when I started looking into <a href="https://mjml.io/">MJML</a>. MJML is a responsive email library that allows you to create rich emails using a syntax similar to HTML. It also offers a CLI to convert the MJML files into (minimized, and this is important) HTML.</p>
<p>So in order to use MJML for SES templates, two issues needed to be adressed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate plain text from MJML - not supported directly by MJML</li>
<li>All generated output must be valid when expressed in a single line - because still, the output must be part of a JSON property in the SES template</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1, and given an already minimized HTML, it’s just a matter of removing all the <code>\n</code> and making sure that the generated CSS does not contain any problematic comment (which by default, is the case, phew).</p>
<p>For 2, I decided to use <code>html-to-text</code> (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-text">https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-text</a>) node package (specifically its CLI) and some <code>bash</code> magic to properly format the contents in the format that AWS expects (using <code>\r\n</code> for line breaks).</p>
<p>So this is what my solution looks like:</p>
<pre><code>├── bin
│   └── upload-ses-template.sh
├── build
│   └── welcome.json
└── templates
    ├── welcome.json
    └── welcome.mjml
</code></pre><p>This bash script is driving all the process (<code>upload-ses-template.sh</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span><span></span>
TEMPLATE<span>=</span>$1

RAW_HTML<span>=</span><span>$(</span>mjml ./templates/$TEMPLATE.mjml --config.minify true<span>)</span>

HTML<span>=</span><span>$(</span>echo $RAW_HTML | sed -e <span>'s/"/\\\\"/g'</span><span>)</span>

TEXT<span>=</span><span>$(</span>echo $RAW_HTML | html-to-text --ignore-image --noLinkBrackets | sed -e <span>'s/"/\\\\"/g'</span><span>)</span>
TEXT<span>=</span><span>$(while</span> IFS<span>=</span> read -r line; <span>do</span> echo <span>"</span>$line<span>\\\\r\\\\n"</span>; <span>done</span> <span>&lt;&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"</span>$TEXT<span>"</span> | tr -d <span>'\n'</span><span>)</span>

mkdir -p ./build
cat ./templates/$TEMPLATE.json | sed -e <span>"s~%html%~</span>$HTML<span>~"</span> -e <span>'s/%html%/\&amp;/g'</span> -e <span>"s~%text%~</span>$TEXT<span>~"</span> -e <span>'s/%text%/\&amp;/g'</span> &gt; ./build/$TEMPLATE.json

cat ./build/$TEMPLATE.json

set -x

aws ses delete-template --template-name papyro-$TEMPLATE
aws ses create-template --cli-input-json file://build/$TEMPLATE.jso
</code></pre></div><p>(BTW, if you know a better way of joining a multiline text using <code>\r\n</code>, please let me know, I did struggle quite a bit and the solution is not that nice as you may have noticed)</p>
<p>So given a wireframe (note the <code>%text%</code> and <code>%html%</code> placeholders) of SES template (<code>templates/welcome.json</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"Template"</span>: {
    <span>"TemplateName"</span>: <span>"papyro-welcome"</span>,
    <span>"SubjectPart"</span>: <span>"Welcome to Papyro!"</span>,
    <span>"TextPart"</span>: <span>"%text%"</span>,
    <span>"HtmlPart"</span>: <span>"%html%"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>and its MJML template (<code>templates/welcome.mjml</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>mjml</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>mj-head</span>&gt;

</a></p><h3>Residency Status</h3>
</div>
<p>For the survey, we were intentionally vague as to what defines an international developer, as we didn’t want to exclude anyone who considers themselves to be one. 7% of respondents were Japanese citizens. However, having Japanese citizenship doesn’t preclude someone from being international, as they could have obtained citizenship by naturalizing or be a citizen who grew up outside the country.</p>

</div>
<p>The Greater Tokyo Area, consisting of Tokyo itself, along with the neighboring prefectures of Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa, remains the hub for international developers, with 86% of respondents living there.</p>

<p>Outside of the Greater Tokyo Area, the other prefectures that had more than a couple of responses were Aichi (4), Fukuoka (6), Hyogo (4), Ibaraki (5),  Kyoto (7), Okinawa (5), and Osaka (5).</p>

</a></p><h3>Swift developers most satisfied, PHP developers least satisfied</h3>
</div>
<p>With the exception of a few outliers, programming languages didn’t strongly correlate with job satisfaction. As respondents who used PHP also had the <a href="#salary-by-programming-language">lowest salaries</a>, this could in part explain their low satisfaction. On the other hand, neither Swift nor Objective-C correlated with exceptionally high salaries, indicating that there is more to this correlation than it just being a proxy for salary.</p>

			<p>GameStop Corp (GME) continues to rally today and is now up over +370% in 2021. GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well asocial media platforms. Both sides are holding their ground with strong conviction, but in the end, one side will be the outright winner, and in the later rounds of this prize fight the long shareholders are way ahead on points.</p>
<p>GME short interest is $5.51 billion; 71.79 million shares shorted; 139.57% SI % Float; 58.26% S3 SI % Float; 31% stock borrow fee on existing shorts and new shorts are paying over 80% fee.</p>
<p>GME has now climbed to #12 in the short interest league table:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png" alt="" width="641" height="465" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png 641w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9-585x424.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></p>
<p>A year ago, GME short interest was $276 million; 63.98 million shares shorted (stock price was $4.32); 104.01% SI % Float; 50.98% S3 SI % Float. While shares shorted only increased by +12%, total dollars as risk have risen by +1,900%. A scarcity in stock borrow availability has limited the increase in shares shorted, but even as mark-to market losses we are not seeing a decrease in overall shares shorted. In fact, GME has the highest level of SI % Float for any equity worldwide (with short interest over $100 million).</p>
<p>GME is #1 in highest Short Interest % of Float:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png 640w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10-585x232.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>GME’s SI % of float is over 100%, which is illogical as you cannot get five quarts of milk out of a gallon jug. In actuality, GME’s short interest is 58.26% if we include the “synthetic longs” that are created by short sales in the float calculation. A portion of these “synthetic longs” become lendable shares as they settle in&nbsp; lending programs (mutual funds and ETF providers), marginable retail accounts and rehypothicatable hedge fund accounts. Short selling therefore not only provides added daily trading liquidity but also stock loan liquidity which supports not only the ability to execute Alpha generating short trades but also liquidity for portfolio hedging strategies and derivative (option\swap) hedging.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 days we saw shares shorted increase by +1.53 million shares, worth $117 million, an increase of +2.18% as its stock price rose +281%. Over the last 7 days we saw shares shorted increase by +900 thousand shares, worth $69 million, an increase of +1.27% as its stock price rose +116%.</p>
<p>We are still seeing a short squeeze on existing older shorts, with these more value-based short sellers trimming or closing their positions due to large mark-to-market losses. But, for every short position that is closed, and stock borrow returned we are seeing extremely strong demand from new short sellers looking to initiate new short positions and capitalize on an Icarus like fall for a stock price that has soared too high. Brokers and Prime Brokers are looking into every nook and cranny to satisfy short selling demand.</p>
<p>Shorting GME has not been a profitable trade for short sellers. Shorts were down -$968 million in net-of-financing mark-to-market losses in 2020 and are already down -$5.05 billion in 2021, which includes a loss of -$876 million on today’s +16% intraday move (stock price $89.00).</p>
<p>At the moment, the prize fight is between momentum longs and momentum shorts, with the longs way ahead on points but shorts are looking for a knock-out in the later rounds. While long buyers are continuing to throw punches by continuing to bid up stock prices, short sellers do not have many haymakers left to throw as stock borrow supply curtails new short selling activity in size.</p>

<p>If GME’s stock price remains at these levels or continues to rise, both value and momentum shorts will be squeezed out of their positions and GME’s stock price will get the added boost of short buy-to-covers standing shoulder to shoulder with long buyers in driving up GME’s stock price. But if GME’s stock price faulters, shorts will hold on to their positions and scramble for any slivers of stock loan borrows they can garner as long buyers begin exiting their positions in order to lock in their recent outsized mark-to-market profits. If long shareholders do begin selling, there may be an avalanche of long sellers hitting the tape since no-one wants to see their mark-to-market profits melt away and be the last ones holding the bag. Either way, this is a heavy weight fight worth watching.</p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>

World</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>
<p>Threads:</p>

</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html">Tilde Expansion</a>: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but
POSIX is silent.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

<p>Not-forking avoids duplicating the source code of one project within another
project, where the projects are external to each other. </p>

<p>Not-forking <strong>avoids project-level forking</strong> by largely automating change management in ways that 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control">version control systems</a> such as 
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> cannot.</p>

<p>This following diagram shows the simplest case of the problem Not-Forking solves. 
An external piece of software, here called
<em>Upstream</em>, forms a part of a new project called <em>Combined Project</em>.
<em>Upstream</em> is not a library provided on your system, because then you could simply
link to <em>libupstream</em>. Instead, <em>Upstream</em> is source code that you copy into the <em>Combined Project</em>
directory tree like this:</p>

<p>Some questions immediately arise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should you import <em>Upstream</em> into your source code management system? All
source code should be under version management, but having a checkout of an
external repository within your local repository feels wrong... and do we want
to lose upstream project history?</li>
<li>If <em>Upstream</em> makes modifications, how can you pull those modifications into
<em>Combined Project</em> safely?</li>
<li>If <em>Combined Project</em> has changed files in <em>Upstream</em>, how can you then merge
the changes and any new changes made in <em>Upstream</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>The developer now has good reasons to separate <em>Upstream</em> project code from its
repository and maintain it within the <em>Combined Project</em> tree, because in the
short term it is just simpler. But that brings the very big problem of the
Reluctant Project Fork. A Reluctant Project Fork, or "vendoring" as the <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian
Project</a> calls it, is where <em>Combined Project's</em> version of
<em>Upstream</em> starts to drift from the original <em>Upstream</em>.  Nobody wants to
maintain code that is currently being maintained by its original authors,
but it can become complicated to avoid that. Not-Forking makes
this a much easier problem to solve.</p>

<p>Not-forking also addresses more complicated scenarios, such as when two
unrelated projects are upstream of <em>Combined Project</em>:</p>

<p>In more detail, the problem of project forking includes these cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tracking multiple upstreams, each with a different release schedule and version control system. Manual merging is difficult, but failing to merge or only occasionally merging will often result in a hard fork. LumoSQL tracks <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/dir?ci=tip&amp;name=not-fork.d">three upstreams</a> that differ in all these ways</li>
<li>Tracking an upstream to which you wish to make changes that are not mergable. Without Not-Forking a manual merge is the only option even if there is only one upstream and even if the patch set is not complicated. An obvious case of this is replacing, deleting or creating whole files</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/836911/">Vendoring</a>, where a package copies a library or module into its own tree, avoiding the versioning problems that arise when using system-provided libraries. This then becomes a standalone fork until the next copy is done, which often involves a manual porting task. Not-Forking can stop this problem arising at all</li>
<li>Vendoring with version control, for example some of the <a href="https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/network/members">132 forks of LibVNC on GitHub</a> are for maintained, shipping products which are up to hundreds of commits behind the original. Seemingly they are manually synced with the original every year or two, but potentially Not-Forking could remove most of this manual work</li>
</ul>

<p>The following diagram indicates how even more complex scenarios are managed with
Not-Forking. Any of the version control systems could be swapped with any
other, and production use of Not-Forking today handles up to 50 versions of
three upstreams with ease. </p>

<p>If you are reading this on Github, you are looking at a read-only mirror.
The official home is the <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking">Fossil repository</a>,
and that is the best way to contribute and interact with the community. You 
may raise PRs on Github, but they will end up being pushed through Fossil anyway.</p>

<p>Here you will find the tool and its libraries, and the <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking/doc/trunk/doc/not-forking.md">full documentation</a>.
It also contains an example configuration (in directory doc/examples) which can
be used for testing.</p>

<p>To install the tool:</p>
<pre><code>perl Makefile.PL
make
make install     &lt;== you will likely need root for this
</code></pre>
<p>At which point the <code>not-fork</code> command is installed in the system and its
required modules are available where your perl installation expects to
find them.</p>

<p>You might be wondering about runtime dependencies. That is covered in the
full documentation, but in brief, not-fork knows what is needed for each of
many different scenarios and it does not need to be addressed now. That 
means you don't need to worry about what not-fork might be used for when
you install it. Currently not-fork can use access methods including 
Git, Fossil, wget/tar and ftp. Modules will likely be added, for example for
Mercurial.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use the tool without installing by using the
following commands:</p>
<pre><code>perl Makefile.PL
make
perl -Iblib/lib bin/not-fork [options] ...
</code></pre>
<p>To try the tools using the included example configuration, use:</p>
<pre><code>perl -Iblib/lib bin/not-fork -idoc/examples [other_options] ...
</code></pre>

<p>Git <code>rebase</code> cannot solve the Not-Forking problem space. Neither can Git
submodules. Nor Fossil's <code>merge</code>, nor the <code>quilt</code> approach to combining
patches.</p>

<p>A VCS cannot address the Not-Forking class of problems because the decisions
required are typically made by humans doing …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Searching through a system to find files or folders can be complex and time consuming, even with a graphical user interface. In this chapter we'll look at how to use the shell to search for files and folders and some quick ways to accomplish common tasks.</p><h2 id="introducing-the-find-command">Introducing the Find Command</h2><p>The <code>find</code> (search for files) command is used to search for files and folders and to perform operations on the results. Let's see it in action by running it in the <code>~/effective-shell</code> folder.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Running the Samples</strong></p><p>Each of these samples assumes you are in the <code>effective-shell</code> samples folder. If you don't have this folder, just run:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/effective-shell
curl -s -L https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C ~/effective-shell
cd ~/effective-shell
</code></pre><p>This command will download and extract the samples folder in your home directory and then set it as your working directory.</p></blockquote><p>Let's set the current working directory to the <code>effective-shell</code> folder and run the <code>find</code> command:</p><pre><code>$ cd ~/effective-shell
$ find
.
./text
./text/simpsons-characters.txt
./scripts
./scripts/show-info.sh
./websites
./websites/simple
./websites/simple/index.html
./websites/simple/styles.css
./websites/simple/code.js
...
</code></pre><p>By default, <code>find</code> will list all of the files and folders which are present in the current working directory. It will also show the <em>children</em> of any folders it finds, meaning that it shows the full hierarchy of files and folders.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Find not working on MacOS</strong></p><p>If you are running these samples on MacOS, you will probably see the following output:</p><pre><code>$ find
usage: find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]
</code></pre><p>This is the <code>find</code> command telling you what parameters can be used. On MacOS the default <code>find</code> command does <em>not</em> assume the current working directory.</p><p>This is because there is a difference between the MacOS and GNU versions of <code>find</code> and in this book I will use GNU wherever possible as it will be more compatible (MacOS is based on the BSD operating system, most Linux distributions use a set of tools which are part of the GNU project - there are sometimes differences).</p><p>To run the equivalent command on MacOS, just provide the current directory as a parameter:</p><pre><code>$ find .
</code></pre><p>A better solution is to install the <code>findtools</code> package, which will install the GNU versions of the tools we'll be using:</p><pre><code>$ brew install findtools
$ gfind
</code></pre><p>If you do install <code>findtools</code>, remember that all of the GNU versions of the tools start with <code>g</code> - so when reading this chapter substitute <code>find</code> with <code>gfind</code>.</p><p>For more details on what BSD and GNU are, you can check <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/work-in-progress/">Chapter - Unix, Linux, GNU and POSIX</a>, which covers these concepts in detail.</p></blockquote><p>So this is the <code>find</code> command - you can provide it a directory (or let it use the current directory) and the command will list all of files and folders in the given directory, including all children.</p><p>You can also provide multiple directories:</p><pre><code>$ find /usr/bin /usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/fwupdtool
/usr/bin/gnome-keyring
...
/usr/sbin
/usr/sbin/cupsd
/usr/sbin/pppdump
...
</code></pre><p>This is the most basic use of <code>find</code> - showing a file and folder hierarchy. Now let's look at how to search using this command.</p><p>Perhaps the most common use for <code>find</code> is to search for files. There are a number of options which can be used to filter the results shown, which allow us to search for files. Let's look at some common ways to refine our searches, using the <code>~/effective-shell</code> folder as a playground to search in.</p><h2 id="searching-for-files-or-folders-only">Searching for Files or Folders only</h2><p>The <code>-type</code> parameter can be used to search either for files or folders. Let's see both in action. First, we'll search for files only, using <code>-type f</code>:</p><pre><code>$ find . -type f
./text/simpsons-characters.txt
./scripts/show-info.sh
./websites/simple/index.html
./websites/simple/styles.css
./websites/simple/code.js
...
</code></pre><p>And for folders, using <code>-type d</code> (remember, <code>d</code> is for directory!):</p><pre><code>$ find . -type d
.
./text
./scripts
./websites
./websites/simple
...
</code></pre><p>It's important to note that when searching for folders, the <code>find</code> command shows folders which are normally hidden, such as the special ‘dot’ folder<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>In both commands, I specified the ‘dot’ folder as the place to search. I could omit this parameter; I just think it makes it a little more readable.</p><h2 id="searching-by-name">Searching by Name</h2><p>We can use the <code>-name</code> parameter to search for files and folders by name. For example, this is how we would search for anything with the letters <code>log</code> in the name:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "*log*"
./logs
./logs/web-server-logs.txt
./logs/apm-logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm05.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm02.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm03.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm00.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm01.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm04.logs
</code></pre><p>You can see I've used a <code>*</code> wildcard before and after the letters <code>log</code> - this means that I have actually supplied a <em>pattern</em>, which could be read as ‘any characters (including nothing), followed by the characters <code>log</code>, followed by any other characters (including no characters)'.</p><p>If I don't use a wildcard, the <code>logs</code> folder will not be found - because it doesn't match the <em>pattern</em> <code>log</code> - without using a wildcard, the pattern is explicitly looking for an <em>exact</em> match:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "log"
</code></pre><p>Note the output - no files or folders were found, as none have the <em>exact</em> name <code>log</code>. The <code>-name</code> parameter is very specific - it will only match files or folders with the <em>name</em> provided. Here's an example:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "apm00.logs"
./logs/apm-logs/apm00.logs
</code></pre><p>Here I have used <code>-name</code> to search for an <em>exact</em> name. What about if I search for <code>apm-logs</code>?</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "apm-logs"
./logs/apm-logs
</code></pre><p>The <em>folder</em> named <code>apm-logs</code> is found, but not the <em>files</em> in the folder - the names of those files don't match the pattern <code>apm-logs</code>. What if we make it a wildcard pattern?</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "*apm-logs*"
./logs/apm-logs
</code></pre><p>The same results! This is because for the <em>files</em> in the <code>apm-logs</code> folder they don't have <code>apm-logs</code> in their name anywhere - that is in their <em>path</em>, i.e. the full address of the file including its folder. So let's look at how to search by path next!</p><blockquote><p><strong>An Important Note on Quotes</strong></p><p>Make sure you use quotes when building your patterns. This command:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "*log*"
</code></pre><p>Will give different output to this command:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name *log*
</code></pre><p>Why is this? In the first case, we explicitly pass the text <code>*log*</code> to the <code>find</code> command and let it deal with it. It uses the wildcards to build a pattern. Because we've surrounded the parameter with quotes, the shell itself doesn't try to do anything clever with the wildcard.</p><p>In the second case, <em>the shell itself</em> tries to deal with the wildcards, then passes the results to <code>find</code>. And the shell deals with them differently. You can see exactly what the shell expands them to with this snippet:</p><pre><code>$ parameter=(*log*)
$ echo $parameter
logs
</code></pre><p>In the second case the shell is performing its own expansion of the wildcard and not searching through all of the child directories. We need to wrap the parameter with quotes so that the shell knows <em>not</em> to interfere with the text and instead pass it to <code>find</code>, so that find can deal with the wildcard.</p><p>The shell is using <em>globbing</em> in the second case, which is covered in a later chapter.</p></blockquote><h2 id="searching-by-path">Searching by Path</h2><p>The <code>-path</code> parameter can be used to filter the results based on a pattern in the <em>path</em> of the file:</p><pre><code>$ find . -path "*apm-logs*"
./logs/apm-logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm05.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm02.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm03.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm00.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm01.logs

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>I</strong></p><p>I was born and raised in Venezuela. Twenty-plus years of Hugo Chavez’s Chavismo left me with a deep suspicion of power.</p><p>Add to that Trump’s presidency (and the constant parade of politicians consumed by power before that), the myriad of corrupt and extractive corporate and financial tycoons, and the yearly news of disingenuous religious leaders and the suspicion only grows stronger.</p><p>I used to deeply wish for good men to take positions of power - to some degree I still do. For the longest time, I personally wanted to take on roles of power because, naturally, I think of myself as a good person and thought I could do good.</p><p>As time passes, I find myself increasingly uninterested by the idea of having power and, more broadly, wishing for all these power positions to concentrate less power. I am increasingly interested in diffusing power, as I believe it to be a very effective way to do good.</p><p>In a<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/havel.html"> beautiful brief speech</a> (which I strongly recommend you read) given upon accepting the Sonning Prize, Václav Havel meditated on what drives people to seek power. He identifies three main reasons: their ideas on how to better organize society, the longing for self-affirmation, and the perks.</p><p>Havel reflects on how the last two tend to overcrowd the first. He was trying to understand how power slowly becomes a goal in itself and how as power concentrates and tends to the absolute, it ends up corrupting absolutely, as Lord Acton famously said.</p><p>As president of Czechoslovakia, every day afforded Havel the opportunity to change the world for the better, affirming his identity as useful and loved by many.</p><p>Havel was indeed an essential man: he did not sit in waiting rooms or traffic waiting for the red light to change; he did not cook his meals or place his own calls. None of these things were more important than his daily work of running an entire nation.</p><p>These privileges are all fine and well. The challenge is: can we tell when someone crosses the line, from sensical privileges to abusive? There isn’t a straightforward, hard-line. More importantly, can the person in power tell? Well, that’s even harder.</p><p>Havel realized that while power affords self-affirmation, in the process, it robs people of their identity. The person who first wanted to limit the influence of power was changed by power. As he sees it: “Someone who forgets how to drive a car, do the shopping, make himself a coffee, and place a telephone call is not the same person who had known how to do those things all his life.”</p><p>For Havel, the conclusion is that power is a “job for modest people, for people who cannot be deceived”.</p><p>I think this is true, yet it is not nearly enough.</p><p><strong>II</strong></p><p>How do people accumulate power?</p><p>The first way is physical violence, the oldest and most enduring reason, yet decreasingly important, as physical threats are easier to ascertain and economic interdependence lower the payout of violence.</p><p>Persuasion and narrative control are also as old as power and growing in importance as new forms of communication provide a global audience.</p><p>And then there are economies of scale and network effects, or the benefits of being big.</p><p>As with the motivations for getting power, the methods for getting it are also deeply interconnected. And in this case, I believe it is the size and scale that subsumes and overcrowds everything else.</p><p>The best explanation I can find for why institutions get big is Coase’s theory of the firm. Coarse argues that firms grow when internal coordination is easier and cheaper than transacting amongst different entities in the open market.</p><p>In imperfect markets, there is a cost associated with price discovery (benchmarking, negotiating, agreeing on terms). Inside a firm, prices and contracts are easier to set, so functions and products get internalized. As more things come inside the firm, it gets bigger. The bigger it gets, the easier it is to compete with others because costs go down and margins go up. The bigger firms get so does their market share, which reduces the cost of marketing and distribution.</p><p>As firms, parties and religious groups get too big, they fail to serve well smaller niches of their markets. This opens the door for smaller competitors, who can thrive caring for a smaller market, or grow to replace the incumbent if the market they serve overshadows the rest.</p><p>Yet, when companies get too big, they can cut out the basic supplies needed for smaller competitors to serve niche markets. When that happens, antitrust laws are enacted to limit their power. In politics, voting and election rules can be tinkered with to curtail the most powerful.</p><p>Yet laws and regulation are not always as effective as we would like.</p><p>In Judaism, there is this idea of building a fence around the Torah.</p><p>Following the law of the Torah is at times challenging and yet always so important that more laws are created to keep you from breaking the core laws. That’s the fence: laws designed to protect laws. For the layman, such fences are also built, to keep men from abusing positions of power.</p><p>Unfortunately, the more laws are created, the harder they are to follow, which makes it harder to know if you are drawing inside the lines or outside. As complexity increases, laws tend to become harder to follow, and hence more unfair (for how can a law be fair if people can’t understand it).</p><p>As anyone who has kids knows, few and simple rules, which are easy to follow and enforce, do better. The challenge tends to be that, in big and complex legal systems, those who make the laws have the most power (that’s how the system got big and complex in the first place). And as power moves from doers to rule-makers, things end up worse off.</p><p><strong>III</strong></p><p>The right amount of power is like water. Too much concerntration of power and we get ice; a static system that can’t change. Complete dissipation of power and we get a gas; the random bouncing of particles that can’t coordinate. We want power to be, as the Santa Fe Institute crew says, at the edge of chaos; sufficiently well structured that organization and coordination is possible, but suffictly loose that change and learning is constantly happening.</p><p>I think we are coming out of an ice age of power. My fellow countryman Moises Naim calls this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Power-Boardrooms-Battlefields-Churches/dp/1469031205">the end of power</a>. Big nations-states are breaking; since WWII, the number of nation-states tripled. Minority parties continue to grow in number and representation in Europe. We have more primaries than ever in the U.S. Around the globe, there are very few dictators left .</p><p>The role of government is being unbundled: Bitcoin is disrupting monetary policy, Gofundme, Khan Academy and the kickstarters of the world are complementing fiscal policy. SpaceX is privatizing NASA.</p><p>And yet, executive power is ever expanding in the US, state surveillance continues to increase, and the rise of China represents a massive black hole of power.</p><p>Companies stay less time on the S&amp;P 500, CEOs last less on their tenure, popular brands have more dramatic arcs and new technologies are constantly redefining how we do basic things like communicating, eating and moving.</p><p>Still, the gap between CEO compensation and average employees is rapidly rising, real wages are stagnant, and inflation in essentials like education and healthcare is rampant.</p><p>Tiktokers, youtubers and podcasters are creating one-person media empires, while NYT and the likes are turning into technology companies to better serve (and better ad target) their audience.</p><p>As power thaws, some are trying to keep it cool, while others want it to evaporate.</p><p>There are jobs to be done in each of these camps. I for one, want to contribute to a productive diffusion of power. To do that, power certainly cannot be overly concentrated, but neither can there be total chaos.</p><p><strong>IV</strong></p><p>To keep power at the edge of chaos, we need some things to be very stable and dependable, so that other things can be very surprising and unpredictable. Is like life: we need the DNA to be super stable, so evolution can run its experiments, environment and randomness conditioning individuals in all sorts of weird and unexpected ways. There is no individualism in biology without stable foundations. I think this is also true in society, and specifically as it relates to power.</p><p>This means that we need a hierarchy: stability, predictability and trust at the foundation vs. change, surprise and competition at the surface.</p><p>There are many projects out there today trying to build foundations that allow for the diffusion of power, or supporting agents that diffuse power via competitive means.</p><p>Here is a list of some interesting examples:</p><p><span>Financial</span></p><p>Stable foundation: <a href="https://squarecrypto.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a>. I believe Hayek when he said prices transmit information. For an economy to work we need prices to do their work. The concentration of monetary policy power in the hand of a selected few nations had led to the abuse of money via debasing. BTC solves for trust and predictability, taking control from the few, and giving it to anyone who wants to participate.</p><p>Surprising surface: Fintech generally is an example here. In particular, <a href="https://aven.com/">Aven</a> invented the first asset-backed credit card. Wealth is a virtuous cycle: it accumulates, protecting against inflation, and bringing access to the debt via collateralizing the assets. People without assets are left out. With Aven, people can use a house or a car to get competitive credit terms, leveling the playing field.</p><p><span>Commerce</span></p><p>Foundation: The best counterbalance to the increasing concentration of power of Amazon is not legislation, and is not going back to the past; is <a href="https://www.gheller.co/2021/01/23/shopify.com">Shopify</a>. Allowing more sellers to go independent with a business model that is transparent and aligned helps diffuse power in ecommerce. Shopify is the main component, but there are many more: there are many other pieces where it is hard for an independent seller to compete with Amazon and where other companies can help by setting the right foundations: for example, <a href="https://returnly.com/">Returnly</a> provides an Amazon level platform for returning products to any seller.</p><p>Surface: Beauty is probably the commerce category that …</p></section></div>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll admit it—I’m a bit of a sex toy elitist. Both in starting this blog and in my own bedroom, I tend toward stronger, fancier, longer-lasting toys with price tags to match. If I’m going to buy something, I’d rather wait to save up than make compromises—which is why Womanizer’s “The One” and Satisfyer’s “One Night Stand” pulsating air toys caught me off-guard. These very similar toys cost only ten dollars each and are positioned as tasters, giving users a chance to try this relatively new type of stimulation without shelling out the roughly $60+ for a fully-featured model.</p>
<p>The catch? They’re completely disposable, with the Satisfyer lasting 90 minutes and the Womanizer tapping out after a mere half hour. That’s it. There’s no recharging or replacing batteries unless you can hack the device (read on…). Both toys are programmed to brick themselves after the allotted time, even before the sealed AAA batteries are completely dead.</p>
<p>This seems like a bad idea. Let’s give it a go!</p>

<p>When the toys arrived (in suspiciously similar packaging), I enlisted my girlfriend, an established pulse toy fan, to lend me a hand in testing them out. While both feel robust for their price point, we agreed that the Satisfier distinguished itself with a slightly more solid and streamlined feeling in the hand. Only the Womanizer’s removable silicone head makes it possible to clean between sessions or users, if that matters given its 30-minutes service life. Initial impressions made, we started a timer, set both toys on their most powerful settings, and settled in for some playtime.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with air pulse toys, they basically use a small, oscillating silicone cup to stimulate through light, pulsing suction, usually on the clit. They create a sensation slightly different from a traditional vibrator, and they can often be much quieter.</p>
<p>The Womanizer feels rumblier, while the Satisfier is buzzier and more powerful, as if the Satisfier has a higher pulse frequency but the Womanizer has a slightly greater amplitude. Especially when used on my frenulum, the Womanizer’s protruding, soft silicone head makes it easier to create a comfortable suction seal for strong, focused stimulation where the Satisfyer’s more plastic-y head cannot. Both toys fit to my girlfriend’s clit well and created nice gentle stimulation, especially when stronger settings were paired with a bit of lube to enhance the seal. We both would have preferred more intense stimulation from both toys, and the finer control offered by the Satisfyer’s four power settings compared to the Womanizer’s three didn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>While neither toy is quite as strong or comfortable in the hand as their multi-use siblings like the Satisfyer Pro 2, my girlfriend and I agreed that they are generally pleasant to use. They stayed true to their stated time limits with no noticeable change in power, diligently shutting off at exactly 30 and 90 minutes, respectively.</p>
<p>But, when the Satisfyer shut itself off and the dust settled, neither of us had even gotten close to cumming.</p>
<p>Both toys disappoint for one simple reason: it’s hard to get off when you can’t stop watching the clock. Even with the Satisfyer’s more generous 90-minute timer, knowing that your sex toy is counting down the seconds to oblivion like a masturbatory time-bomb is just not sexy, a flaw only exacerbated by the fact that, unlike vibrating dildos, air pulse toys are truly useless without their powered functions. These factors combine to create a sense of designed hostility; these toys are literally designed to let you down.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the worst part.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, selling an item designed to turn itself into e-waste in the course of an evening is wildly unethical, especially without so much as a recycling program or pay-to-unlock system to lessen the environmental impact. Both the Satisfyer and Womanizer utilize a sealed clamshell design and mix of plastics that will make them hard for electronics recyclers to deal with, and, as shown in the Teardown section of this post, the disposable nature of both toys is purely profit- rather than design-driven. Womanizer’s parent Wow Tech and Satisfyer should seriously reconsider this product category.</p>

<p><strong>Teardown</strong></p>

<p>Now that both toys’ timers have run out, it’s time to dive in, see what makes them tick, and find out if we can hack our way around that pesky self-bricking “feature.”</p>

<p>Beginning with the Satisfyer, pulling the rather beefy two-piece ABS clamshell apart reveals the mysteries within. The injection-molded halves of the case are impressively designed, with neat alignment pins to keep the two sections together and tight tolerances on interior features that hold components in place with a friction fit. Often a surprisingly hard thing to get right, this mold has clearly been made with care.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the device sits a lone, small PCB with control circuitry powered by two standard AAA batteries, which largely account for the toy’s weight and robust feeling. Towards the top left sits a small DC motor, which rotates a lubricated semi-flexible linkage to oscillate the toy’s silicone diaphragm and create air pulses. Even after 90 minutes of use, the batteries were far from flat, and the diaphragm linkage assembly rotated smoothly, confirming my suspicion that the toy’s time limit is enforced in firmware rather than the result of some hardware limitation.</p>

<p>A closer look at the two-layer PCB doesn’t reveal much. The circuit consists of just one unmarked IC, two ceramic capacitors, a diode, a resistor, and a pushbutton for user input. The IC is almost certainly a very simple microcontroller, but, without any further clues as to its provenance or an immediately responsive reset pin, I decided to save my hacking efforts for the Womanizer.</p>

<p>The Womanizer’s ABS case stubbornly resists prying, but cutting some of its internal pins with a rotary tool allows for easy access. While this toy’s outer ABS case is slightly simpler, it contains two other plastic parts that clip the components together.</p>

<p>The toy operates on the same principle as the Satisfier, using a small DC motor to oscillate a silicone diaphragm, this time with a slightly tighter, better-made linkage. However, the Womanizer uses just one AAA battery and is controlled by a significantly more complicated circuit.</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="126" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/womanizerelecsep/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-300x169.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-768x432.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>The Womanizer The One’s purple ABS battery clip alongside its PCB and motor/diaphragm subassembly.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The two-layer PCB has a discrete transistor that switches current to the motor, a four-position DIP switch for user input, a bunch of passives, and four IC’s. Voltage regulators boost the single battery’s voltage to a suitable level for driving the motor while another small microcontroller, this time an A262AFB, provides the brains of the operation. I couldn’t find any information on this particular chip, but the board’s silkscreen provides some clues. Most notably, the via marked “CLEAR” creates the tantalizing suggestion of a way to reset the chip, hopefully allowing for another 30 minutes of play time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after significant experimenting and poking around, it does not seem that either of vias near the “CLEAR” label is a true reset line, although all is not lost. Connecting both via’s simultaneously to the base of transistor T1 often (though not always) seems to glitch and reset the device. Just like that, the Womanizer is back in action for another 30 minutes.</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="616" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1024x616.jpg" alt="" data-id="128" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/womanizerhackdiptych/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1024x616.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-300x181.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-768x462.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1536x925.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-2048x1233.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1200x722.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>Interior of the Womanizer The One with my hacked-in glitch switch ;P</figcaption></figure>
<p>A small switch between these two points allows for easy glitching by rapidly disconnecting and reconnecting them, and it even conveniently fits into the little access hole I cut to open the Womanizer in the first place. Now I can glitch the microcontroller for effectively unlimited 30-minute cycles.</p>
<p>Sketchy? Yes! Beautiful? Also yes!</p>
<p>All things considered, both the Womanizer’s The One and the Satisfyer One Night Stand are examples of good technical design applied to a terrible product strategy. They feel good in the hand, are mechanically solid enough to survive a few drops and run far longer than their intended service life, and create air pulse stimulation that, while far from earth-shattering, is impressive for their $10 price point. Without the lines of code make them useless after little more than one play session, I’d be buying them as gifts and recommending them to everyone I know. </p>
<p>Sometimes, hackable sex toys are fun, encouraging me to explore and think up quirky new features to make them truly feel like <em>mine</em>. But the fact remains that very few people have the tools, skills, or time to cut and solder a bricked Womanizer into a real, semi-usable sex toy. Instead, both The One and The One Night Stand leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, teasing the nice, affordable products they <em>could have been</em> before being undermined by environmentally ruinous programmed disposability.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before we get into it this week, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/pirate-waves">a quick note on Pirate Waves</a>, a private, voice-based group chat for the ELITE, for the BRILLIANT, for the absolutely based and pirate-pilled. In other words, welcome to the official Pirate Wires live chat for paying subscribers, contributors, and various other people I find interesting, funny, or cute. Henceforth, we’ll be hosting a private Clubhouse chat every first and third Tuesday of the month. If you’d like to join, but haven’t yet become a paying member of the Pirate Nation, you’re in luck: it is —&nbsp;<em>for now</em> — still technically legal to subscribe my budding media empire. </p><p>Another quick note, I’ve decided to experiment with a brief library of links at the bottom of each week’s wire. I’ll be including noteworthy tweets, longer form pieces, and news stories I find interesting or important. In the future, feel free to scroll straight down for the links, or read the wire and ignore the links, or unsubscribe and send me hate mail. I don’t care what you call me, baby.<em> Just call me. </em></p><p>As ever, feel free to comment on this week’s wire below, or let me know what you think about the link library, Pirate Waves, or whatever else is going on inside that beautiful mind of yours. </p><p>Okay, back to regularly scheduled programming. </p><p><strong>The shape of things.</strong> Last week, I took another look at the anti-tech ‘extraction’ meme that’s been gaining traction among local government apologists who, we have improbably discovered, somehow exist in this country. But, in the context of Clubhouse, the aforementioned voice-based social media app, I also briefly touched on a dynamic I’d like to expand on today: new communication platforms, operating at scale, shape an entirely new kind of politician. </p><p><a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/extraction-intensifies">Via ‘Extraction Intensifies’:</a></p><blockquote><p>This particular instantiation of voice chat has unlocked something powerful, and a new dimension of social media is emerging. Five years from now, it’s possible Clubhouse, or a similar application, will be something political leaders actually have to engage with in order to succeed. Were such a shift to happen, voice chat would have as dramatic an impact on the shape of politics as Twitter, without which, for example, neither the Republican presidency of Donald Trump nor the domination of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the Democratic Party would be possible. In a Clubhouse world, we would see an entirely new kind of politician emerge. </p><p>Rogan for president? I’m not even joking.</p></blockquote><p>Geoff Lewis recently raised an interesting point on the topic:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>That a technology as newly-dominant as social media must necessarily present new, and potentially-calamitous challenges for human civilization is something I’ve written about at length. Last year, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/jump-23d06adb4cb7">in </a><em><a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/jump-23d06adb4cb7">Jump</a>, </em>I took a look at the potential for social media-induced information disaster, an entirely new class of catastrophe. We haven’t yet seen ‘The Big One,’ but there are warning signs everywhere, including one this week <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/investing/gamestop-stock-reddit-wsb/index.html">in the GameStop stock rally</a>. In <em>Tether</em>, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I explored our increasingly-warped sense of shared reality</a>, the inherent malleability of information in the digital age, and the dramatic erosion of large-scale group identity endemic of a digital world. But what about the narrow question of politics, and politicians? </p><p>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok: each of these apps has been designed to keep people engaged for as long as possible. Capturing attention was also the goal of print, radio, and television, but the Twentieth Century was an age before machine learning, which greatly amplified our ability to give people what they really want —&nbsp;or, at least, what they really want <em>right now</em>. The progression was natural, but inevitable. Social media companies replaced a small, elitist cabal of mass media truth arbiters (who have by the way never forgiven them) with the seething, chaotic human Id, individual by individual, at the scale of hundreds of millions or even billions. In aggregate, this tends to present as a ravenous, drug-addicted digital mob. </p><p>Basic human impulses have always shaped culture, but now artificially-intelligent algorithms directly reward positive social stimulus in the form of “likes” and “retweets” <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">with frequent, daily dopamine hits to the brain</a>. What people “like” and “retweet” in the greatest numbers tend to cluster into our most immediate, and animalistic desires: status, sex, and war, or conflict, itself the realm of fear and anger. We also get a lot of humor, a kind of pressure release (thank God). The dopamine reward naturally drives content creators, from journalists and performance artists to politicians, in subtle ways they themselves may not even be able to perceive. Without our daily (hourly?) dose of attention, many of us, and certainly most compulsive creators, start to feel the pangs of dopamine thirst. We reach for our phone. We post. </p><p>This is classically-presenting addiction shit. Do you really want that cigarette, or are you literally out of control right now? </p><p>In the narrow context of politicians, it’s important to remember that social media does not incentivize people to say what they think, it incentivizes people to say what they think is <em>working</em>. To some extent, this has probably always been true, and not only in politics. But the dopamine delivery device for social validation has not always lived in our pocket. Proximity to the drug has catalyzed frequent use, frequent use has led to dependence, and now this addiction —&nbsp;to attention, essentially — is shaping the political world. Have you ever scrolled to the beginning of an Instagram celebrity’s photos and noticed a jarring evolution from grainy pictures of food, sunsets, and laughing friends to a near-exclusive library of selfies and well-oiled abs by the pool? Well, the final boss Twitter version of the Instafamous professionally-pretty person appears to be a highly-polarizing populist demagogue, and politicians like this are now winning elections that once seemed impossible. </p><p>A lot of ink is spilled on the dangerous rhetoric of politicians like Trump and Bernie Sanders. But social media, a reward system and delivery device for our most impulsive, immediate desires, mainlined these people into culture. These politicians aren’t our greatest danger, and neither is their rhetoric. The system of rewards and delivery driving these politicians into existence is the problem we need to address, and given the realities of virality I think this problem, if left <em>unaddressed</em>, could be existential. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technically true.</strong> Much has been said of the media’s political bias, but I’m beginning to wonder if some journalists might simply be suffering from extreme dopamine thirst. As is now evidenced beyond all doubt, a significantly thirsty writer will tweet just about anything for a hit of attention. This is sort of the implied meaning of “hot take,” a brief argument that may be correct, or interesting, but that is clearly written in a way intended to polarize. The hot take, however, is the stuff of opinion. The version of this we sometimes see in reporting is framed as “truth,” which is much more serious. As with almost everything on the internet, misleading headlines are not a new phenomenon. What’s new, and notable, is the scale of our exposure to the phenomenon. Today, on Twitter, many of us&nbsp;now spend a significant portion of our lives inside a virtual world of headlines. </p><p>This week, a piece of what was meant to be sober tech reporting was framed in a way that absolutely blew my mind: “Instacart is firing every employee who voted to unionize,” <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1352333971514937344?s=20">tweeted </a><em><a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1352333971514937344?s=20">the Verge</a></em><a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1352333971514937344?s=20">.</a> The obvious read, here, is Instacart fired employees for unionizing, which was the sentiment shared by hundreds of comments on the story, many of which were themselves widely shared. This is how the internet works, which every reporter knows. Indeed, reporters often lament the fact: no one reads the actual story. The tweet, for most people exposed, <em>is</em> the story. </p><p>This all begs the question: if we understand the tweet and headline framing a story are of such dramatic consequence to public discourse, how can anyone justify a dishonest tweet or headline? </p><p>As it isn’t legal to fire employees for organizing a union, a move like this from Instacart would be extremely dangerous. In fact, the story seemed so insane I found myself compelled to do something truly rare: I briefly paid attention to <em>the Verge</em>, and clicked. After the headline, the subhead, and the first three paragraphs, what I finally learned was this: </p><p>Instacart did<em> </em>lay off ten grocery workers who voted to unionize. But these workers comprised a fraction of a percent of <em>two thousand</em> lay offs. The total number of grocery workers? <em>Ten thousand</em>. I also learned this story <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers">was basically a re-hash of a </a><em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers">Motherboard</a></em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers"> piece</a>, which was just as dishonestly framed. But so it goes. The Instacart lay-offs are newsworthy, but the purpose of framing the piece as a hit on unions was not to honestly inform. It was to enrage. </p><p>Dan Primack, business editor over at <em>Axios</em>, was quick to critique the move. </p><p>Zoe Schiffer, the writer responsible for the <em>Verge</em> piece, was quick to defend her work. </p><p>One commenter mentioned the offending headline (which was in the first place much more than a headline, let’s not forget) was “objectively true.” Lee Edwards countered:</p><p>This may all seem like a niche drama, but the frame was dishonest, anyone willing to look at this story with open eyes can see the frame was dishonest, and all of this is happening in a broader context of newly-ferocious efforts to suppress “inaccurate” or “misleading” speech. This brings us to Twitter. </p><p>One of the many problems inherent of a social media platform where top-down censorship of the “untrue” is made officially the law of the land is it effectively rubber stamps a giant “ACCURATE” tag over every piece of information that is <em>not</em> censored. In a world where the “untrue” is ostensibly removed from view, people naturally assume they can believe what they read. In this way, Twitter’s model of censorship is beginning to exacerbate the impact of …</p></div></div>

    <div>
        <p>LONDON. <strong>Mr Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, why hasn't AstraZeneca been more specific on detailing the supply problem detected on its European plants? What exactly is the problem? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<div><p>“I think we have been relatively specific with the information. Of course, we are all very disappointed. We would like to produce more. I think we will deliver up to Europe in the month of February a reasonable quantity actually, very similar to what others have delivered on a monthly basis. But of course, it's less than expected and also because our vaccine is easy to use people expected more so we could scale up.&nbsp;Our team is working 24/7 to fix the very much issues of production of the vaccine itself. You have two steps in the production of a vaccine: one is you produce the vaccine itself. We call it a drug substance, the vaccine. Then, when we are finished with it, we move this into different plants where we put the vaccine into vials and we call that the drug product, the final product.&nbsp;For Europe the drugs substance is essentially produced in two plants, one in the Netherlands, one in Belgium. The drug product is actually produced in Italy and Germany. So from a drug product viewpoint, we have full capacity. We have zero problem. The current problems have to do with manufacturing the drugs substance”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“So maybe I need to give you a little bit of explanation as to how we manufacture those vaccines. Essentially, we have cell cultures, big batches, 1000-litre or 2000-litre batches. We have cell cultures inside those batches and we inject them with the virus, the vaccine, if you will. Then those cells produce the vaccine, it’s a biotechnology protection. Now, some of those batches have very high yield and others have low yield. Particularly in Europe, we had one site with large capacity that experienced yield issues. So it's essentially a question of when you scale up to the level we are scaling up to - &nbsp;something like this that's never been done. We are scaling up to hundreds of millions, billions of doses of vaccines at a very high speed".</p></div>

<div><p>“A year ago, we didn't have a vaccine. When you do that, you have glitches, you have scale-up problems. Therefore, the yield varies from one to three, by the factor of three. The best site we have produces three times more vaccine out of a batch than the lowest producing site. We do this with a series of partners: in the US, those partners are actually approved by BARDA, the US administration, the group that manages those things and manages the capacity”.</p></div><p>
"In the US, we also have issues of yield and essentially our engineers have worked with our partners to identify what the issues are. We believe we have sorted out the issues now. The issues are different, for instance, in Belgium: we believe it was more a question of downstream filtering because when you finish making the vaccine, you have to filter it. When you filter it, you put it into vials.&nbsp;Our partner in Australia for instance also had yield issues. And they have been in the vaccine business for 20 years. But it's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really kind of sort out all sorts of issues. We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be. We've had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain.&nbsp;But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have&nbsp; had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. As for Europe, we are three months behind in fixing those glitches. Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small”.</p>

<div><p><strong>You say that EU is going to receive a reasonable quantity of doses by February. Could you please quantify this?</strong><br>
"First of all, as soon as we get an approval by EMA, in the next few days, we will be shipping at least three million doses immediately to Europe, then we'll have another shipment about a week later and then the third or fourth week of February. And the target is to deliver 17 million doses by February. So, I am just estimating roughly, that would mean like about 3 million doses for Germany, probably 2,5 million for Italy and something like 2 million for Spain. I don't know exactly what the precise allocation is, but it's based on the population of each country. If you're in Germany, you can vaccinate three million people in one month. It's actually not so bad especially for the people who are the most exposed and most at risk. That's not a small proportion. And if you apply the three month regimen, then in March, you can do the same again or more potentially because we are working hard to increase our goals. It's not as good as we would like to, but it's really it's not so bad”.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>So Europe signed the contract too late, instead of the UK?</strong><br>
“I will not pass judgment on this. But I can only tell you the facts and the facts are that we basically signed an agreement with the UK three months before we did have it with Europe. Now, part of this can be easily explained. When we entered the agreement with Oxford, they had already been working with the UK government on this. So they had a head start. We were able to quite quickly take the UK supply chain and improve it. We had to modify the formula in the process, because Oxford gave us a process that needed to be modified to enable manufacturing at scale.&nbsp;Just think about, we've done all of this in months. Usually, it takes years. We got a manufacturing process that Oxford gave us, which was producing a good vaccine, but not at an industrial scale. It was just able to produce quantities for clinical trials. So then we had to modify the process to turn it into a process that could manufacture billions of doses. At a cost that is reasonable and at a speed that is reasonable".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We had to change all of these. Then we had to do what we call technology transfer. So we go to each partner and we train them on the process. We train them on how to manufacture. And then, you know, some people are new to this process. It's like they learn the process. They don't know how to make the vaccine and they're not as efficient as others".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"So you may have lower productivity. That's why we have a productivity going from one to three. And so, unfortunately, it's really bad luck. Actually, there's nothing mysterious about it. But look, the sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe. And quite honestly, I mean, we're not doing it on purpose. I'm European, I have Europe at heart. Our chairman is Swedish, is European. Our CFO is European. Many people in the management are European. So we want to treat Europe as best we can. You know, we do this at no profit, remember? We didn't go into this to try and make money or whatever. We would like to treat Europe as good as possible. I actually do believe we treated Europe fairly". &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
"Now, let me give you another number. Our total capacity globally now is about 100 million doses a month.&nbsp;From February onwards we are able to make 100 million doses a month, that's not small. Most vaccines have 100 million doses a year, that already takes us on a 1,2 billion pace per year. We are going to keep growing. Of course, we are ramping up production and Europe is getting 17 percent of this global production in February for a population that is 5 percent of the world population.&nbsp; Now, from the beginning we took very seriously the approach that Europe took, which we thought was fair and we all took. In fact, the US didn't say that Europe said that. Europe said the vaccine is common good and everybody needs to get access at the same time globally. That's what we are doing. Europe is getting 17 percent of our global supply for a month for 5 percent of the world population. The problem is: 100 million doses is a lot, but we have 7,5 billion people in the world".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We are in the ramp-up phase and basically it will improve, but it takes time. Having said all of this, I'm not looking for excuses, honestly.&nbsp; We take accountability. We want to do better and we're working day and night. Our people in manufacturing, we have hundreds of people, thousands of people now. Many of them didn't take any Christmas vacation. I'm not asking you feel sorry for us but you know, we're doing our very best. But it's a very complicated process and a big scale”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>After the explanation you just gave at the same time it is striking the aggressive way which the EU has responded, even threatning to impose a new control on exports of activity out of Europe. Some are suggesting that you're selling your product to some other countries.&nbsp; </strong><br>
“The suggestion we sell to other countries to make more money is not right because we make no profit everywhere.That's the approach we took and we agreed on that. That’s the agreement we have with Oxford University.&nbsp;It's actually even written in a contract we have with Oxford University: that we will be at no profit. We have slightly different prices from one geographic to the other because the cost of goods may be different. We have a supply chain in Brazil, we have another one in Latin America, another one in South Asia. We have one in Japan. Of course, you know, local costs are different. So you've got slight variations, but more or less, it's about three to four dollars, more or less everywhere.&nbsp;It makes no difference. Zero difference. I understand we all want to be vaccinated. I think the populations of Europe, like everywhere else in the world, have been under so much stress with this pandemic for so long …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

    <p>Turing machine programs are sometimes represented as directed graphs. The vertices of the graph are the program’s states and the edges are transitions between states. The program’s print and shift instructions are relegated to being labels for the edges. Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/green-graph.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>Suppose you have a Turing machine diagram, but you don’t have access to the print and shift instructions. All you have is the graph of the states and their transitions. I don’t know why you don’t have the prints and shifts, but you don’t. Maybe you’re looking at the diagram on an overhead projection and you forgot your glasses. Maybe the diagram was drawn on a whiteboard and somebody walked past and bumped into it and wiped away the instructions. Maybe you had the program on a deck of punch cards but you dropped them and the cards got out of order and now all you can recover are the state transitions. Way to go, you klutz. Try a rubber band next time.</p>

<p>What can you tell about a program given only its state transitions? Certainly it isn’t possible to figure out exactly what the progam does. There’s no way to tell how the machine will interact with the tape. But the program’s logical structure can be discerned. Look at the example above. States 1 and 2 do some kind of initialization for state 3. States 3, 4 and 5 form a loop. States 5, 6 and 7 form another loop. The 3-4-5 can, based on a decision made at state 5, extend to include 5-6-7 loop.</p>

<p>Why was 6 afraid of 7? Becase 7 ate 9. Neden 4 5 korkuyor? Çünkü 5 6 yedi. The one-two-three cat made it across the river, but the un-deux-trois cat sank.</p>

<p>Busy Beaver programs have state transition graphs too. What do you think they would look like in general? What kinds of properties would you expect a Busy Beaver graph to have?</p>

<p>As far as I know, this question was first posed by Joshua Zelinsky <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916#comment-1850560">in a blog comment</a>. It seems like an obvious question when you hear it, but I haven’t seen any evidence that anyone had ever thought much about Busy Beaver graphs before that. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03184.pdf">James Harland</a> pointed out that Busy Beaver graphs can’t be <em>disconnected</em> (that is, that there can’t be two nodes between which there is no undirected path), but didn’t go any further. <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147554934.pdf">Ludewig, Schult, and Wankmüller</a> compiled an appendix of 100 long-running 5-state programs, each accompanied by a hand-drawn state transition diagram. Look at these nice graphs:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/uwe-graphs.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>They went to all the trouble of drawing all those diagrams, but their report doesn’t mention the graphs at all. Why not?<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Zelinsky conjectured that all Busy Beavers graphs are <em>strongly connected</em> (that is, that for any two nodes, there is a directed route from one to the other). Call this the <strong>strongly connected graph conjecture</strong>. <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">Scott Aaronson</a> made a broader and vaguer proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A related intuition, though harder to formalize, is that Busy Beavers shouldn’t be “cleanly factorizable” into main routines and subroutines – but rather, that the way to maximize runtime should be via “spaghetti code,” or a single n-state amorphous mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the <strong>Spaghetti Code Conjecture</strong>. On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese, is the longest-running program of some fixed length. Like Aaronson says, it isn’t a formal statement. It’s a stand-in for a set of formal statements. It implies the strongly connected graph conjecture, for instance, and other statements too. Which statements? That’s a research program. Or maybe it’s a research programme.</p>

<p>I’ll say more about the Spaghetti Code Conjecture, but before that I want to look at an application. And before <em>that</em> I want to say something about the nature of “spaghetti code”.</p>

<p>It’s sometimes defined as code that uses <code>goto</code> statements. But that isn’t right. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.6084&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Donald Knuth</a> uses <code>goto</code> in his programs, and he doesn’t write spaghetti code. “Spaghetti” is a logical property, not a syntactical one. It means that the code’s control flow is <em>convoluted</em> or <em>unduly complex</em>. It’s not enough for the control flow to be just <em>complex</em>, it has to be <em>unduly</em> complex. If the code is modeling something that is complex using control flow that is simple, it’s probably wrong. Spaghetti code has a control flow that is more complex than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, a lot of code that is written by professional programmers is spaghetti. Shocking, I know, but true. Spaghetti code is often not created intentionally. It can result from carelessness, or even a lack of taste. Here are two ways of setting a variable to some conditionally chosen value:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>## ternary expression ##################
</span>
<span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>else</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span>

<span>## if / else ###########################
</span>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>():</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ternary expression is obviously the better choice here. It has a simpler control flow. One assign statement, one path. The if-else block has two assign statements, each executed on a separate path. It’s spaghetti-er than the ternary. It’s also much more common. Is that a coincidence? A general lack of taste would explain the correlation. It could explain some other things too.</p>

<p>It really isn’t accurate to describe a Busy Beaver program as “spaghetti”. Spaghetti has a flimsy structure, great for slurping. You wouldn’t want to eat something with the structure of a Busy Beaver program. It would be unpleasant going down and unpleasant coming back up. And make no mistake, it would come back up.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the application of the Spaghetti Code Conjecture. A program can be converted to a state transition graph by ignoring its print and shift instructions and considering only the states. Now go the other direction. Given an <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color state transition graph, how many concrete programs correspond to it? In other words, how many ways are there to decorate the graph with print and shift instructions? There are <em>nk</em> transitions. Ignoring <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/04/turing-machine-notation-and-normal-form.html">normalization</a>, each transition gets a left or right shift and one of the <em>k</em> colors. That makes <em>2k</em> decorations per transition, and so <em>2nk<sup>2</sup></em> programs per graph. Is that right? I hope so. That means 40 programs per graph in the ❺② case, and 54 programs per graph in the ❸③ case.</p>

<p>This fact can be applied to Busy Beaver searching. The naive search method generates all <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color programs and then searches them. But the total number of programs gets out of hand fast, growing on the order of <em>O((nk)<sup>nk</sup>)</em>. A better way to do it is to generate the possible graphs first and then decorate them with instructions. The Spaghetti Code Conjecture can then be used at graph-generation time to discard graphs that seem unsuitable. (How many program graphs are strongly connected? I have no idea. That’s a sophisticated calculation, and I don’t know what I’m doing.) Discarding a few graphs means discarding a whole swath of programs. It can’t be overemphasized how many programs there are. Discarding them is like bailing water out of a ship. There is no choice but to get rid of a lot of them, and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This isn’t just idle speculation. I used the <em>graph decoration</em> technique along with Zelinsky’s strongly connected graph conjecture to find <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/09/beeping-busy-beaver-results.html">the reigning ❹② Beeping Busy Beaver champion</a>. The conjecture has predictive power! So as far as <em>I’m</em> concerned, its value has already been proved.</p>

<p>Wait, did somebody say “proved”? Like, the conjecture has been formally proved? No, of course not. I doubt it can be proved at all. It might even be provably unprovable. But it could nevertheless be true. Busy Beaver searchers are interested in establishing lower bounds, not upper bounds. If a conjecture leads to better lower bounds, that’s good enough.</p>

<p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck? Would a beaver eat spaghetti? Raccoons sure do love rummaging through my trash, I can tell you that.</p>

<p>Here’s an argument that the strongly connected graph conjecture is true. It’s not a real proof, just a suggestive argument. Argument by induction on the number states, with fixed <em>k</em> colors. 0- or 1-state programs are trivial and/or degenerate, so start with the base case of 2 states, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Busy Beaver programs run on the blank tape, so the program starts in transition <code>A0</code>. If it stays in state <code>A</code>, then it will remain on transition <code>A0</code> forever, and is therefore junk. So <code>A0</code> must transition to <code>B</code>. Does <code>B</code> have any connections to <code>A</code>? If it doesn’t, then the program will spend the rest of its execution time in its <em>k</em> <code>B</code> transitions, and won’t be able to use the full <em>2k</em> transitions available. But surely such a program can’t be the ❷ⓚ Busy Beaver. Kinda QED on the base case. Next, the induction step. The <em>n</em>-state Busy Beaver is strongly connected. What about the <em>n+1</em>-state Busy Beaver? Suppose it isn’t strongly connected. For simplicity, suppose also that <em>n+1</em> is the least number of states for a Busy Beaver program whose state graph is not strongly connected. Every Busy Beaver program through <em>n</em> states is strongly connected spaghetti, but then some kind of structure gets introduced at <em>n+1</em>? Why? What kind of structure? Why <em>n+1</em>, and not earlier or later? It seems unlikely. The inductive step is kinda done, and that takes care of the loosey-goosey informal argument.</p>

<p>So we think that Busy Beaver program graphs should be strongly connected. What other properties should they have? I’m now going to enter into the territory of rank speculation and propose a few properties that seem like they should hold. Some caveats:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Busy Beaver programs need to halt, and that means they need to include a halt state (exactly one, in fact). Inclusion of the halt state makes for a lot of exceptions to otherwise general statements. I don’t feel like making that explicit, so just assume that the exception is there. This doesn’t apply to Beeping Busy Beaver programs, because <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/01/14/halt-quasihalt-recur.html">they don’t indicate program termination in such a clumsy fashion</a>. In general, <a href="https://oeis.org/A337025">halt-free programs</a> will have a more pleasing graph structure than programs with a halt instruction.</li>
  <li>These conjectures are meant to apply <em>n</em>-state programs where <em>n</em> is “sufficiently large”. This is great for the conjecturer, as it …</li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><img src="https://blog.eutopian.io/images/heraclitus.png" alt="Heraclitus"></p>

<p><em>“Out of every hundred men, ten shouldn’t be there, eighty are just targets”</em></p>

<p><em>Heraclitus 535 - 475 BC.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My posts on <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-2.-preparation/">Winning Systems for Cyber Security Practitioners</a> are my most popular. In them, I attempt to change your perspective on the relative importance of products and <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/forget-solving-the-cyber-security-skills-shortage/">skills</a> in securing what’s precious to you. I make the case for using systems <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-1.-introduction/">(in the broadest sense of the word)</a> not goals. Systems aren’t new. They pre-date the product-era of today. From infrastructure to code, you can count on them. Products and vendors come and go. Skills are irregular and scarce. It is systems that are eternal and universal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ve taken my advice, you’ve factored default-deny, responsiveness, robustness, and resilience into your thinking. This post is about minimising your attack surface. In it, I explain what this means and why it may be our best hope for reducing vulnerability in practice. Finally, I’ll tell you what the world might look like if we took this winning system to its ultimate logical conclusion. Before we get there let’s begin at the beginning.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>

<h5 id="1-codebase-size-quality">1: Codebase Size &amp; Quality</h5>

<p>According to the Software Engineering Institute, software developed in the USA has about 6000 defects per million lines of source code (MLOC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for high-level languages like Java and C#. High-quality code has 600 to 1000 defects per MLOC. Code of exceptional quality developed with the highest levels of assurance exhibits defects below 600 per MLOC. Between 1% and 5% of those defects are thought to be security vulnerabilities<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Let’s apply that research to some well-known codebases and see what the numbers look like.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FreeBSD</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>2700</td>
<td>54</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Oracle<sup id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></td>
<td>25</td>
<td>4500</td>
<td>90</td>

<tr>
<td>Windows</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>9000</td>
<td>180</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Facebook</td>
<td>65</td>
<td>19500</td>
<td>390</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The low estimates don’t look bad. There’s no chance they apply here. Even the high rate may be too conservative for contemporary Internet-based applications. Most technology companies optimise for the shortest time to market, because they have competition. They optimise for flexibility, because they don’t know what they’re building until they find product/market fit. Security, stability, and ease of maintenance (the conventional measures of software quality) are not high on the list of priorities.</p>

<h5 id="2-tractability-distributedness">2: Tractability &amp; Distributedness</h5>

<p>MLOC is a simplistic measure. Modern Internet applications consist of a mixture of software from a long and complex supply chain. Partly Open Source. Partly licensed. Partly offshore. Partly of unknown origin. Some code recent. Some ancient. Some developed with great care. Some slapdash. Modern web applications draw upon software in the form of services from a dozen places. Your application may be partly distributed even though you think of it as centralised.</p>

<p>Consider this <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/the-stack/">blog</a>. It has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">web server</a> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">Operating System</a>. It uses cosmetic client-side javascript. It has an external comment section. Fonts and cookies come from Google. I should say something about SSL and DNS services. Without these, the site wouldn’t function. All this attack surface for some static text that looks much as it would have in the 1980s. Its puny code is distributed and diverse. It doesn’t even offer an application in the conventional sense. The simplest things have a larger attack surface than you think. Some numbers:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
<th>CVEs To Date</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>OpenSSHd</td>
<td>0.020</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>NGINX</td>
<td>0.165</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>23</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OpenSSL<sup id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></td>
<td>0.536</td>
<td>150</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>194</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LibreSSL</td>
<td>0.344</td>
<td>104</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p>For OpenSSL nobody believes 194 CVEs represent anything other than a small fraction of the actual vulnerabilities. OpenSSL is mature and supposedly security-critical. It has a highly exposed codebase. It has a single design-purpose. What do you think the vulnerability rate is like for the average piece of software? Our high estimates don’t look high after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-informal-methods">3: Informal Methods</h5>

<p>Some vulnerabilities are design weaknesses or logic errors. Not buffer overruns. Not input validation problems. Not statistical errors. Not side-channel attacks. They are precedence bugs, off-by-one bugs, or errant state machine misbehaviour. Not the kind of flaw that static analysis is good at spotting. Not the kind of flaw you can easily patch away.</p>

<h5 id="4-unintended-consequences">4: Unintended Consequences</h5>

<p>I’ve said nothing about deployment practices, configuration, or administration. Even if you aren’t a developer, there’s no shortage of ways you can expose or create vulnerability as a consequence of individual configuration choices. Software has many layers and many settings. Unintended consequences arise from interactions between these settings and layers. Defaults are frequently a poor choice. Even documentation is sometimes misleading in a way that jeopardises security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As code breadth, depth, diversity, and distributedness increases, so does scope for errors and vulnerability. These four problems are the reason why software is insecure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="good-news-bad-news-luck-judgement">Good News Bad News, Luck &amp; Judgement</h4>

<p>The news isn’t all bad. Some part of the odds falls in our favour.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all vulnerabilities are exposed by default.</li>
<li>Not all exposed vulnerabilities are exposed to unprivileged users.</li>
<li>Not all exposed unprivileged user vulnerabilities end in system compromise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience tells us we can’t draw comfort from this. There are many winning systems but luck is not one of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>What was hidden from exposure can be inadvertently revealed.</li>
<li>What was inaccessible to unprivileged users can slip within their reach.</li>
<li>What looked like a tiny hole, turns out to be a secret passage into the castle.</li>
</ul>

<p>What about judgement? The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) improves software quality and with it security. However, it provides only a marginal reduction in total vulnerability once we consider the sum of a deepening stack, spiralling dependencies, and increasing distributedness and diversity of code within real applications. If software quality is order and flaws are disorder, disorder is still increasing at a faster rate than order can be imposed. This isn’t an argument against S-SDLC, DevSecOps, Formal Methods, or any other software quality initiative. It’s an observation that these things are not an adequate braking force. We continue to roll downhill towards greater overall vulnerability.</p>

<p>Consider “as a service” providers. They carry their own vulnerable software, which they may improve. They also carry the vulnerable “genes” of all the other components, products, and 3rd party services they build upon. They have no meaningful control over this inheritance and only partial influence over whether those genes are “expressed” in their particular formulation of an architecture or service. Soon software will be everywhere, inside everything. Much of it vulnerable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The winning system is, therefore, the relentless limitation of attack surface. Whether it be by design, development, or deployment. Preferably all three. Don’t wait for software quality to improve. Count on it remaining lousy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reducing-attack-surface-in-practice">Reducing Attack Surface In Practice</h5>

<p>This series is for practitioners, but it talks of systems. It does so because practices co-evolve with technology and technology becomes obsolete, invalidating practices with it. You can watch this happen in real-time. Professionals, products, and  companies struggle to stay relevant when customers move from traditional physical infrastructure to cloud to serverless.</p>

<p>Winning systems are eternal. They transcend the tech-de-jour. The IT industry hasn’t grasped this. That’s why job descriptions are still packed with vendor and product names. It’s why product companies fail to talk a language that business understands. It’s why I still think a classical Computer Science and Software Engineering background helps. It separates pristine theory from messy, proprietary, and perishable practice.</p>

<p>So let’s start with the pristine theory first before getting dirty with practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>For software which you must expose, expose only a small part.</li>
<li>For that small part:

<ul>
<li>Expose it only to a constrained group of users.</li>
<li>Expose only a necessary subset of its functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For that subset:

<ul>
<li>Eliminate complexity, making it as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Apply the winning systems of least-privilege and default-deny.</li>
<li>If a given function can be achieved in a less risky way, take it.</li>
<li>Where complexity is unavoidable, treat that software with suspicion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove unused or vestigial elements, they are a liability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The practical extent to which one can limit attack surface is case-specific. It depends upon the level of control you have over the software in question and the environment within which it runs. However, everyone can do something to limit their attack surface, even if your control is limited to that of a network or systems administrator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the part where we risk a little obsolescence by talking in more detail about practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shedding-vulnerabilities">Shedding Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Deactivate non-essential modules/plugins. Apply universally from applications to kernels.</li>
<li>Remove unused functionality from code or Operating Systems.</li>
<li>Deactivate non-essential network services.</li>
<li>Better still, don’t install or activate them in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="restricting-vulnerabilities">Restricting Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Don’t expose networked applications to traffic which is:

<ul>
<li>Not yet authenticated.</li>
<li>Not yet validated in some way.</li>
<li>From non-paying users/agents (business model permitting).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="shielding-vulnerabilities">Shielding Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Where services are only used from within your network (or within a host), prevent them being accessed from other points of origin.</li>
<li>If services can be bound to individual IP addresses or interfaces, bind them.</li>
<li>Remove unused network protocol stacks.
<br></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="designing-out-vulnerability">Designing Out Vulnerability</h5>

<p>Now the hard part. If you are designing or building software, you have a golden opportunity to avoid whole classes of vulnerability. Doing so may mean changing how your application or group of applications work together to provide the user with a capability. There will be a trade-off and that trade-off will be specific to your situation. Choose wisely.</p>

<p><strong>^^^ PLEASE USE POST USING ABOVE LINK FOR MY “ONE-LINE IT JUST WORKS” ^^^</strong><br>
(IGNORE EVERYTHING BELLOW THIS AS IT’S THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT WORK)<br>
===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p><strong>2.) Completely QUIT all Chromium windows.</strong><br>
Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>
</del></p>
<p><strong>(OPTIONAL) Get libwidevinecdm version</strong><br>
If you want to check your *actual* libwidevinecdm version, the easiest and quickest way is using user VMX’s elegant python solution:</p>

<p>Launching is hard. The product is never polished “enough”. There are always a hundred more tasks to be completed, and in the midst of a pandemic, it can seem impossible to get a product to the finish line.<br></p>
<p>Yet, we persevered.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We set a deadline of April 30th 2020 for our <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tara-ai-1-0">v1.0</a>, and were all cylinders go, with dozens of completed sprints and pull requests from our team and 50 other teams in our early alpha. Best case scenario: my co-founder Syed and I expected a hundred other teams to sign up within a few weeks. Instead, post launch, thousands of workspaces were activated. In short, we were completely blown away by the response.<br></p>

<ul><li>100,000 tasks</li><li>25,000 sprints</li><li>15,000 product requirements and</li><li>7,000 Github connections</li></ul>

<p>We heard from so many of you how you switched from the “clunk” of Jira, the “mess” of Asana, and how a tool that was built by engineers (for engineers) became your team’s “superpower” to develop and release faster.&nbsp;<br></p>
<br>
<div><figure><img src="https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1024x597.png" alt="Developer feedback" width="768" height="448" srcset="https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1024x597.png 1024w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-300x175.png 300w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-768x448.png 768w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1536x896.png 1536w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-2048x1195.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>

<p>Consider this a promise to you, our power user:&nbsp;<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will always have simplicity at its core.</strong> Simplicity is beautiful, and we promise to continue to maintain an easy to use interface. We persevere to add value with powerful functionality, and you will never require a full-time “administrator” to use the tool. This is a decade-old concept that needs to end, 1- click is all it should take to start and run a sprint, or connect your project management software to source control.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will provide visibility and speed </strong>as you move quickly to deliver software. You should be able to zoom in/out within different concepts in your product delivery assembly line, and the tool should get out of your way as you deliver software.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara should add predictability</strong> to your workflow. Predictably helping your team deliver on their tasks, sprints or pull requests, and providing indicators to do so. Continually delivering on your sprints, helps you deliver on your team’s monthly product milestones, which adds up to delivery on annual business goals for your organizations. In short, predictability in effort completed, and estimating effort, becomes integral to delivering on release timelines.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s next?</strong><br></p>
<p>In 2020, we received over 520 feature requests from a highly active community of power users via Intercom, email and our slack group. And, we saw sprints being created in just over 15 different languages. In 2021, we’re delivering:<br></p>
<p><strong>A smarter Tara.</strong>&nbsp;Developers have to manually change statuses and constantly provide updates to the rest of their team, to move tasks across the development pipeline. We’re building automation that works intuitively with your source control and development workflow, so that your tasks flow from branch creation (TODO) to merged pull requests (DONE). Teams will be able to provide their DOD (definition of done) and automatically move tasks in the hand-off from development to QA, from one engineer to the next.</p>
<p><strong>An improved interface. </strong>We’re making it even easier to search and filter through the platform with smart labels, to help prioritize your work. We’re also working on a new navigation that makes it faster to create tasks, product requirements or sprints, at any level, as your team delivers software from specification to release.<br></p>
<p><strong>Larger teams. </strong>Today, Tara is optimized for workspaces and teams of up to 30 developers. We’ve mindfully crafted the experience for small teams, yet we continue to hear from larger teams that are anxiously waiting to make the switch to Tara. Moving forward, we’re building functionality to support access controls and user management, along with reporting and quarterly/monthly milestone setting. Our mobile experience is also a part of this roadmap.<br></p>
<p><strong>More integrations. </strong>We’ve shipped several updates to our Github integration, alongside a new Gitlab integration. Next up, we’re working on more source control connections, to welcome teams from Bitbucket and other platforms. We’re also releasing our full-fledged Slack app, with reporting functionality and task creation, directly from Slack.</p>
<br>

<p>And, there’s more. We have an even larger roster of updates planned for 2021. To deliver on this ambitious roadmap, <a href="https://tara.ai/about/careers/">we’re hiring</a> engineers, designers and scientists looking to change productivity for developers.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We’re excited to see what you will continue to build with Tara. Here’s to our customers.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards.</p>
<p>&lt;3,</p>
<p>Iba ❤️<br></p>

   Posted 26. January 2021.
   <strong>2 min read.</strong></p></div><div><div><p>Playing with domain names is fun, especially when it comes to the likes of Google and the many variations with multiple <em>o</em>'s in them. Find out what happens when you type the wrong number of <em>o</em>'s in your URL bar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know that <a href="http://gogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gogle.com</a> and <a href="http://gooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooogle.com</a> both redirect to google.com?</li>
<li>🔍 Bing.com is squatting goo*gle.com with 21 o's - i.e. this url leads to Bing: <a href="http://gooooooooooooooooooooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooooooooooooooooooooogle.com</a> 🔍</li>
<li>🦁 Brave.com seems to be <em>randomly</em> selected as target goo*gle.com with 31 o's - i.e., this url leads to Brave from time to time: <a href="http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com</a> (it also often redirects to changing parking pages). Really wondering what / who is behind this.</li>
<li>😱 The same screwed up fake news / bitcoin scam website is squatting no less than 7 of the goo*gle.com domains with 20 o's or less</li>
<li>📣 There remain 5 domains with less than 42 o's available for sale, at an average cost of €188.6 per o - the cheapest one is <a href="http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com</a> (31 o's), priced at €551.35 on Namecheap (strangely enough this is the one squatted by Brave)</li>
<li>🥳 Somehow I was lucky enough to find out that the ones with 30 and 34 o's were actually available for €7.31 each - a discount of 1000x per o's compared to the average of other available domains</li>
<li>🔮 I haven't investigated what comes after 42 o's...nor decided what I will do with my new squatting places - probably some random coding art!</li>
</ul>
<p>See below the full result of analysis (data is from Namecheap, except from 5 o's which cost comes from GoDaddy).</p>

			<p>The station’s atmosphere is maintained at pressure comfortable for the crew members, and a tiny bit of that air leaks over time, requiring routine repressurization from nitrogen tanks delivered on cargo resupply missions. In September 2019, NASA and its international partners first saw indications of a slight increase above the standard cabin air leak rate. The leak has presented no immediate danger to the crew or the space station. The crew isolated sections of the station to monitor pressure changes to find and repair this air leak starting in August 2020.</p>
<p>The Distran Ultra Pro acoustic camera displays the leak location and estimates equivalent pinhole leakage rates and limit of detection in real-time. This Swiss-made technology detects ultrasounds emitted by air flow as it rushes through small holes, seams, and cracks. The acoustic imaging is overlaid on an optical image in real time, offering clear pinpointing of leaks. Ultra Pro records vacuum and jetting ultrasounds emitted by any type of leak (steam, CO2, CH4, H2, etc.) offering a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>Tests have shown that Ultra Pro’s leak detection abilities are not impaired when the frequencies of noise-source energy are sufficiently far from the test frequency. Not all leaks produce ultrasound at the same frequency, and user selection of frequencies from 10-55 kHz is facilitated by an integrated, real-time spectrogram display. The Ultra Pro can potentially locate partially obstructed, hard-to-reach, or hidden leaks, potentially providing a great advantage as the ISS modules are filled with equipment racks, piping, cables, and experiment payloads.</p>
<p>Distran technology has been in use since 2013, mostly in the oil &amp; gas industry, chemical manufacturing, and power plants. This versatile device, which can also pinpoint partial discharges, saves time and gas or electric consumable costs as well as it provides a safe manner to check for leaks from a distance.</p>

<![CDATA[You Don't Need a Virtualenv]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>

<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>“We have a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food and ultra-processed food“</blockquote>
<p><br>…<a href="https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD/status/909205874098397184">tweeted</a>&nbsp;Dr. Robert Lustig, a fellow Professor at UCSF School of Medicine. He’s right. But I&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/909240257270267904">replied</a>&nbsp;with the inconvenient truth few are willing to admit: “processed foods have won the war.” That isn’t to say we should be hopeless about the obesity epidemic, but we must soberingly admit our current strategy for curbing it is doomed. But there is another way. When other strategies fail, clinicians sometimes use “<a href="http://www.uncommon-knowledge.co.uk/articles/uncommon-hypnosis/problems-paradoxes.html">paradoxical interventions</a>” where the problem is prescribed as the cure. So this is a radical manifesto about how processed foods have not only caused the obesity epidemic, but can also cure it. To paraphrase Robert Frost:</p>
<blockquote>“The only way out is through.”</blockquote>
<h2><strong>S.A.D.! The Standard American Diet is 2/3 Processed Foods</strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of the Tufts School of Nutrition, and colleagues published one of the most eye-opening <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/3/e009892">studies</a> on the Standard American Diet (or what I humorously like to call “S.A.D.!”). Astonishingly, they showed that only 1/3 of calories come from ‘unprocessed’ (whole) foods anymore. The other 2/3 of calories come 10% from ‘minimally-processed’ foods (like cheese, which one could potentially make in a kitchen) and a staggering 57% from ‘ultra-processed’ foods (like Cheeze-It crackers, which can only be manufactured in a factory).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/SADgraphic_grande.png?v=1510353917" alt=""></p>
<p>The evidence is clear. By a 2:1 margin, processed foods have dominated whole foods in America like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7TjFqCDrDs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B8MFT53a8TtCwx8jXcL1LLw%3D%3D">Mayweather over McGregor</a>. It’s no wonder, processed foods are widely perceived as cheaper, tastier, and more convenient than whole foods. But what people don’t fully realize is that processed foods are actually a dominant technology developed by a multi-trillion dollar food industry, and we are never, ever going back to the pre-industrial way things were. We live in a world of transformative technologies, and in a nation where <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/millennials-are-top-smartphone-users.html">98% of Millennials</a> own ‘smart’ phones, our society will clearly never go back to ‘dumb’ phones and pagers. So why do we expect any differently with food?</p>
<h2><strong>What Works for Some, Does Not Work for Most</strong></h2>
<p>For an individual, it is obviously possible to eat 100% whole foods. There are lots of great success stories of people who transformed their entire diets, lost 100 lbs., got off of their medications, etc. But just because “it worked for me”, doesn’t mean it will work for everyone else, because not everyone can “just do what I did.” Any clinician who has actually worked with thousands of patients know that different people have different levels of readiness to change, will require different approaches, and as a result, some will simply do better than others. This is not to downplay the importance of individual responsibility. As I tell my own patients:</p>
<blockquote>“It’s not your fault that you came into my office, but it is your responsibility to walk out better.”</blockquote>
<p><br>Thus, we must balance individual responsibility with acknowledging the data that most don’t succeed on their own. Educating the majority of Americans to only eat whole foods, without addressing how to manage processed foods, is like teaching “abstinence only” sex education, and expecting most people to never engage in sexual activity until marriage. Educational strategies that don’t acknowledge human behavior are hopelessly ineffective. We must acknowledge people indulge, and teach them how to reduce harm when they do so.</p>
<h2><strong>Convenience is King, and is More Sustainable Long-Term.</strong></h2>
<p>The science suggests that though doctors admonish their patients to “eat right and exercise”, this advice alone generally fails to work. In fact, in the placebo/control group (designed to show no effect) of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351026/">Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial</a>, patients were counterintuitively instructed to lose 5-10% of their body weight. That’s because researchers knew they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135022/figure/F2/">wouldn’t lose any weight</a> anyway! Even the lifestyle (intensive counseling) and metformin (medication) groups, which did lose weight initially and significantly slow the onset of diabetes, eventually regained all the weight lost they lost after a decade.&nbsp;The temporary weight loss was still beneficial (reduced diabetes risk by 34% over 10 years), but would have been more powerful if the weight loss was maintained:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/metformin_grande.gif?v=1510353972" alt=""></p>
<p>That’s because the law of inertia suggests any clinical treatment for obesity that expects patients to significantly do more work, instead of less, will eventually fail for most people in the long-term. Eating 100% whole foods was only sustainable for a society in a pre-industrial farming era, where the only foods we could eat were the whole foods we hunt, picked, and planted ourselves (that’s the real Omnivore’s Dilemma. Sorry, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/magazine/the-modern-huntergatherer.html">Michael Pollan</a>).</p>
<p>But most people no longer have the time, energy, or resources to eat three home-cooked meals per day. Modern households are no longer inter-generational, with fewer grandparents or stay-at-home spouses to bear the responsibility of communal food preparation. Even when TV dinners were introduced in the 1950s, they “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vP99yWtfovYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">came as a great relief</a> for housewives burdened with baby-boom offspring.” Convenience is king. But it’s not just because we don’t have time to prepare whole foods, it’s because processed foods are so behaviorally irresistible.</p>
<h2><strong>Obesity is More of a Behavioral than a Biological Problem.</strong></h2>
<p>In the medical community, obesity is considered a symptom of a larger ‘metabolic syndrome’, which shows up externally, as belly fat, but also internally as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood fats. But these are actually symptoms of the root problem. While obesity is a complex, biopsychosocial issue with no easy explanation, the explosion in obesity rates suggest there’s something radical going on. &nbsp;If you look at this CDC time lapse of obesity rates from 1985-2010, most states went from &lt;10% obesity to &gt;30% obesity in the span of only 25 years!</p>
<p><iframe width="744" height="419" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ihSeSToXOw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So what’s going on? The main driver is that the way we eat has changed dramatically: with people cooking less, eating out more, and relying more on processed, carbohydrate-rich foods that drive insulin resistance. Thus, this data suggests that obesity is more of a behavioral problem than a biological problem. These foods also serve a psychological need. Despite the current opioid crisis, eating is actually America’s favorite narcotic: with <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/eating.aspx">38% of adults</a> reporting “they have overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month because of stress.”</p>
<h2><strong>Most Ultra-Processed Foods Are ‘Designer Drugs’. We’re Hooked.</strong></h2>
<p>Americans are victims of an ‘obesogenic’ environment that has them hopelessly hooked to the most irresistible designer drug the world has ever known: ultra-processed foods. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waistland-evolutionary-Weight-Fitness-Crisis-ebook/dp/B000W7KNDK/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=0KHF98P7DGDENXB3A6CS">Waistland: A (R)evolutionary View of Our Weight and Fitness Crisis</a>, psychologist Deirdre Barrett argues out that human beings evolved to crave certain stimuli: fats, salts, and sweets, to help us survive and thrive through harsh times. “Big Food” companies exploited these natural cravings by designing processed foods that are far fattier, sweeter, and saltier than anything that normally exists in nature. Thus, processed foods are “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034N7JI6/">supernormal stimuli</a>” purposefully designed to be addictive, and effectively outcompete whole foods on our tricked taste buds.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is a conspiracy theory — Big Food industry scientists have admitted they use such principles to create addictive foods. A New York Times article, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html">The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food</a>”, revealed that companies like Frito-Lay use $30 million R&amp;D budgets to hire research staffs of 500+ scientists to create ‘frankenfoods’ like Cheetos. Cheetos include technologies like “vanishing caloric density,” which make them melt in your mouth so quickly “your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.” In light of such irresistible foods, why do we actually expect people to exercise self-control and just “<a href="https://vimeo.com/97370236">stop it</a>”?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/cheetos_large.jpg?v=1510354062" alt=""></p>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h2><strong>All Drugs Aren’t Bad. All Processed Foods Aren’t Either.</strong></h2>
<p>In the modern era, we treat addiction as a disease, and often replace addictive and impure street drugs like heroin, with prescription opioid medications like methadone that are purified and better controlled to prevent deadly withdrawals and carefully wean people off. Street drugs and prescription drugs are both “drugs”, but can hardly be equated since the former often takes lives, while the latter can often give it back if properly prescribed and used.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can’t lump all processed foods together as being “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M">bad, m’kay</a>?” Minimally-processed foods like yogurt, butter, and cheese, have been made at home for millennia and also ultra-processed in factories more recently. Studies show dairy consumption is associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318689">lower risk</a> of type 2 diabetes. The devil is always in the details though, and a ball of handmade mozzarella cheese is hardly the same thing as processed cheese slices that have so little actual cheese in them the FDA requires legally labeling them as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese#Legal_definitions">cheese product</a>.”</p>
<h2><strong>Intentions Matter: Processing for Health vs. Wealth.</strong></h2>
<p>So we should just avoid ultra-processed foods by avoiding all those chemical sounding ingredients we can’t pronounce, right? While this ‘chemophobia’ can be a helpful shortcut, it’s also not always accurate. If you analyze any whole food like a Kiwi, it’s technically made up of a lot of ‘chemicals’ that naturally exist in nature:</p>
<p>Just because a food is ultra-processed or fortified with added ingredients doesn’t inherently make it unhealthy. While the <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/">World Health Organization</a> educates mothers that breastfeeding for the first 6 months is the “optimal way of feeding infants”, it also acknowledges that infant formula can play an essential or supplementary role in keeping infants alive and healthy when mothers cannot breastfeed regularly. Thus, some ultra-processed foods are optimized for health more than cost or taste, due to tighter government regulations and more selectivity by consumers.</p>

Tkinter is an integral part of Python and you do not need to install it in your working environment. PyQt, on the other hand, is a python binding for Qt, which is a collection of C++ libraries and development tools that include platform-independent abstraction for GUI. To use the PyQt library, we need to install it first. To be comfortable with GUI application production, we need to understand object-oriented programming (OOP) and class elaboration. <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/classes-oop/#:~:text=In%20object%2Doriented%20programming%2C%20a,created%20using%20the%20class%20keyword" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>OOP</span></a> is a type of structuring program that bundles required and related properties/behaviors into an object. Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure) to provide initial value for the state (attributes) and implementations of behavior (methods). </span></p><p id="viewer-f8f8j"><span>
<strong>Do we still need to learn desktop GUI development?</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-emsel"><span>This is a tough question to answer. There is still demand for GUI desktop applications, however, the software development market has been changed noticeably by emerging web and mobile applications. It depends on your situation and interest but as a geoscientist who has a passion for new IT developments, I would vote for web applications because I want to share them easily with users. On the other hand, by using cloud-based platforms, such as Azure (Microsoft) or AWS (Amazon), you will receive plenty of services that make your production and app deployment pleasurable such as database management or app scalability (though it requires subscription). </span></p><p id="viewer-f071o"><span><strong>Web application development </strong></span></p><p id="viewer-1hg7b"><span>By definition, a web app is an interactive computer program built with web technologies like HTML, which stores database and manipulate data by user(s) to perform tasks through the internet. One of the greatest examples of a web application is Google Docs that users can create, read, update and delete documents. To build a web app from scratch, we need to deal with the database, frontend, and backend steps and then have a host to deploy the web application.</span></p><p id="viewer-a9i2a"><span>To create a web app by python scripts, Django, a full-stack framework, or Flask, a micro lightweight web framework can be used. The former helps developers to build large and complex applications while the latter, Flask, is suitable for simple web applications. </span></p><p id="viewer-f5qtp"><span><strong>For a Machine Learning interactive dashboard, do I have to learn Django or Flask? </strong></span></p><p id="viewer-dlcui"><span>Not actually, thanks to OOP, there are several service providers that eliminated these steps for us. One great example is <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stremlit</a>, which is totally free. You can turn data scripts into a shareable web application in python. No front-end experience is required. It is completely compatible with major libraries such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Numpy, matplotlib …</span></p><p id="viewer-6m85p"><span>I used streamlit and its library to build my app but deployed it on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heroku</a>. </span></p><h3 id="viewer-1r9ih"><span>Web App: Well log prediction using various machine learning algorithms </span></h3><p id="viewer-546v5"><span>Motivation: well logs are a critical measurement of the physical properties of rock medium. Commonly, some logs are missing. In this example, we used <a href="https://www.dataenergy.ca/opendata" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Force 2020</a> well log dataset and tried to predict the Neutron Porosity log (NPHI). The predictors (features) are GR, RHOB, DTC, and SP logs and the target log is NPHI. We have chosen a smaller dataset to see the modeling results faster. We selected 3 wells (two for train and test, one blind (not involved in the training process)).</span></p><p id="viewer-33j91"><span>Remember, as well logs are a continuous variable, this is a regression problem and we should choose regression models. Normally, model performance for test datasets is better than those datasets that have not been seen by the model (blind).</span></p><p id="viewer-9vrej"><span>Seven important algorithms have been selected including, AdaBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network), K Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Decision tree, and Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor. If you want to study the logic behind these algorithms, you may look at <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scikit-learn</a> documentation. The most important Hyper-parameters of these algorithms have been selected to be adjusted by the user. You can play around with parameters to see the prediction results. </span></p><p id="viewer-dbqqs"><span>We provided 4 evaluation metrics for model performances, 1 quantitative and 3 qualitative.</span></p><p id="viewer-13lkg"><span>R2 Score is a square of the correlation. It ranges between 0 and 1. We also plotted the true NPHI log from the blind well which is over-laid by predicted NPHI resulted from the model. The distribution of NPHI porosity for true and predicted data is plotted on the up-right. A scatter plot of True and predicted NPHI is also plotted with a correlation fit line on it. If you want to study detail explanation of Machine Learning with a geoscience example, facies classification, you find this series in the <a href="https://www.dataenergy.ca/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> practical.</span></p><p id="viewer-10mr9"><span>In this post, I did not want to elaborate on this app scripting or the result of model evaluation in detail. I intended to show that object-oriented programming and cloud hosting provided a facility that everyone (with some basic knowledge of programming), can develop a web application and share it with others. Leave us a comment with any questions or concerns. </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

it is secure."><div><p>We explain how CryFS works and why it is secure.</p><p>The description can be a bit technical in some points. If you're rather interested in using CryFS, take a look at the <a>CryFS Tutorial</a>.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Storing data</h2><div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/storingdata-6e5ee2b5bc550e4d8be92cbcd80b9011.png" alt="Your files, metadata and directory structure are stored as a set of same-size blocks, encrypted, and stored in the cloud."></p><div><p>The goal of CryFS is not only to keep file contents, but also file sizes, metadata and directory structure confidential.</p><p>To hide file sizes, CryFS splits the content of a file into same-size blocks and encrypts these blocks individually.
A tree structure is used to remember how the blocks belong together to form a file.
This tree structure has very little overhead and itself is also stored using encrypted same-size blocks.
To hide file metadata and directory structure, they are also represented using encrypted same-size blocks.</p><p>Each encrypted block is stored as a file in the base directory, using a random ID as filename.
The base directory can then be set up to be synchronized with a cloud provider like Dropbox.
An attacker with access to the base directory can only see a set of same-size ciphertext blocks and can't see
contents, file sizes, metadata or directory structure of your data.</p><p>The blocks are encrypted using a block cipher chosen by the user. A random encryption key is generated when the filesystem is created.
This key is stored in a configuration file, which is then encrypted using the password chosen by the user.
Since it is encrypted, it can be stored together with the ciphertext blocks in the cloud, which is the default.
If you want to use an insecure (e.g. empty) password or don't trust the scrypt algorithm used for encrypting the configuration file, you can also keep the configuration file locally.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><h2>Configuration File</h2><p>The base directory also contains a configuration file with the information CryFS needs to decrypt it.
This configuration file is encrypted and integrity-checked using the password chosen by the user, so an attacker cannot read or modify it.</p><p>The information stored in the configuration file includes the following.</p><ul><li><strong>[Cipher]</strong>: The cipher used (e.g. <var>aes-256-gcm</var>)</li><li><strong>[Encryption Key]</strong>: The encryption key used for encrypting blocks</li><li><strong>[Root Block ID]</strong>: The block ID for the block storing the root directory (entry point for the filesystem)</li></ul><div><div><p>The configuration file is encrypted twice, once with <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and once with the cipher chosen by the user.
This way, if the user doesn't trust <var>aes-256-gcm</var> for some reason,
they can choose another cipher and still be secure.
The keys for both encryption layers are generated from the user-chosen password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>.</p><p>In detail, CryFS generates two keys <var>outer_key</var> and <var>inner_key</var> using scrypt and the user password.
It encrypts the configuration file using the user cipher and <var>inner_key</var>.
To the ciphertext, it prepends the name of the user cipher (so it knows how to decrypt it later) and encrypts
the result using <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and <var>outer_key</var>. This way, an attacker cannot see or manipulate which cipher is used.
As a last step, the scrypt configuration parameters are prepended, so CryFS knows how to configure scrypt when
decrypting the filesystem.
When decrypting the configuration file, CryFS first reads the scrypt parameters and regenerates both keys from the user password.
Then, it decrypts the first layer and reads the cipher chosen by the user.
Using this cipher, it decrypts the second layer and reads the configuration values.</p></div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/configfileencryption-3ae7bd61acfdd365aab16b721dbbcfad.png" alt="Configuration File Encryption Layers"></p></div><p>The integrity of the configuration file depends on <var>aes-256-gcm</var>.
This cipher is a standard cipher and believed to be very secure.
If, however, you don't trust the integrity of <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and want to use another cipher instead,
we recommend adding the <kbd>--cipher xxx</kbd> parameter each time you mount the filesystem.
This way, CryFS can check that the cipher used by the filesystem is the one you actually specified
and you don't have to rely on the <var>aes-256-gcm</var> integrity verification step.</p><p>Alternatively, you can store the configuration file outside of the base directory and not upload it into the cloud.<br>
This is possible using the <kbd>--config</kbd> parameter when calling CryFS.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Security Analysis</h2><p>The security of CryFS has been proven in a <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/cryfs_mathesis.pdf">master's thesis</a>
and in a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_23">scientific paper published at DBSec 2017</a>
(<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/773.pdf">PDF</a>) using a game-based security approach.
The works also contain a detailed description of the inner workings of CryFS.</p><p>The current version meets all security goals regarding confidentiality of file contents, size, metadata and directory structure.
The integrity goals mentioned in the thesis are also implemented as of version 0.10.0.
The 0.9.x versions protect the encrypted blocks from being modified by an attacker,
since they use an authenticated encryption scheme like <var>aes-256-gcm</var>,
but they don't prevent an attacker from rolling back the filesystem by replacing blocks with an earlier valid version of the same block yet.</p></div></section><section></section> <section></section></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
<p>I wanted to have a look at
<em><a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924021781434">Melodia</a></em>, a public-domain
textbook to learn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight-reading#Sight-singing">sight-reading</a>.
I thought it would be nice to read <em>Melodia</em> on an ebook reader, but the
<a href="https://archive.org/download/cu31924021781434/cu31924021781434.pdf">available
PDF</a> is a
scan of a paper copy in 7 by 10 inches, and my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_Glo">Kobo
Glo</a> screen is only around 3.5 by 4.8 
inches:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/size.svg" alt="sizes of paper and display"></p>
<p>The obvious solution is to scale it down, but it would be too small to read.
So wouldn't it be better if we could split each page into parts of the right
size?</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/split.svg" alt="splitting music into blocks naively"></p>
<p>Of course, it's not that simple. When reading music you want
to follow the lines from left to right, then from top to bottom. It's exactly
like text, where the right way to reflow a page is:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/split2.svg" alt="splitting text into blocks correctly"></p>
<p>One way to do this would be to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_music_recognition">optical music
recognition</a> to
transcribe the whole partition, and then re-render it to the right format. But
that's not so fun, and I don't know if there are good implementations for this
task which I can easily install (i.e., not expensive and Windows-only programs).
Instead, let's go for a more ad-hoc but much simpler approach.</p>
<p>To split music, you need to be able to recognize the separate lines (i.e.,
staves, or systems). Then you need to find a way to cut them: typically at a
measure bar line, to avoid splitting inside a bar. More subtly, for the result
to look good, you want each split line in the output page to have exactly the
same length, even if the bars on the input page did not, otherwise the result
will look jagged. The naive solution would be to stretch each line, but it
will look awful and distorted. Instead, you want to do something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">seam
carving</a>: scale the "uninteresting
parts" (e.g., empty space on the staff) while leaving the "important stuff"
(notes, alterations, etc.) untouched. See:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splitsheet.svg" alt="3 ways to split sheet music"></p>
<p>What's more, because scaling is undesirable, you need to decide where to cut
among all the bar lines. The goal is to avoid having lines that are too
small and need to be resized by a large factor (leaving too much empty space).
The naive way is to fit as many bars as possible on each line, but this can
leave you with very short lines that are hard to format properly.
This is a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap#Algorithm">word wrapping
problem</a></p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/knapsack.svg" alt="word wrapping problem"></p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>So I wrote some code to take care of these tasks for me.
I called it <code>songflower</code>, as in
something that (re)flows songs. The code is <a href="https://a3nm.net/git/songflower">here</a>. I don't
expect it to be usable without significant tweaking, but there is a README and
some documentation that allow to play with it and tweak the parameters.</p>
<p>So what does it do exactly? Glad you asked. :) Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burst the input PDF into a collection of bitmap images, one for each page</li>
<li>Split each page into one image for each <em>line</em> on the page (i.e., staves, or systems)</li>
<li>Split each line into a <em>chunk</em>, i.e., a sequence of consecutive bars having
  exactly the prescribed width. This involves:<ul>
<li>Finding the bar lines</li>
<li>Splitting bars into chunks intelligently</li>
<li>Stretching the chunks to have exactly the right width</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combine the chunks into output pages (laying them out nicely on the page) and
  combine those into the output PDF.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is easy with <code>convert</code> from <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, although
it is pretty long and for some reason and takes lots of RAM. The last step is
also pretty routine: you just greedily put as many chunks on each page as you
can, you need to compute the right spacing between the chunks to fill all
available height in the layout, and then combining the result into a PDF is just
<code>convert</code> again, plus <code>pdftk</code>. The harder steps are the
two middle steps:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/steps.svg" alt="the two hard steps"></p>
<h2>Step 1: Splitting pages into lines</h2>
<p>This step is comparatively easy. The program just looks for
rows of the picture that consist mostly of white pixels. It then smooths this by
merging together consecutive white lines that are sufficiently close (to have
some resilience to noise). Last, it cuts at the largest sets of consecutive
white lines, up to some threshold.
This is how the program sees a page of <em>Melodia</em>: </p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splith.png" alt="illustrating line splits"></p>
<p>The yellow lines are the lines detected as white space, and the red lines are
where the program decided to cut (there were enough consecutive empty lines).
The green lines were not used to cut because they yielded a line that was too
short. The result here is pretty OK, except that the program was a bit too eager
and cut away a tie connecting two dotted minims on the 4th staff from the
bottom. Apart from small problems of this kind, the approach is pretty robust on
the <em>Melodia</em> dataset. The main problems involve slurs, staves that are too
close together on a page, and lyrics which often get removed (this is fine for
my needs but it might not be for yours).</p>
<h2>Step 2: Splitting lines into chunks</h2>
<p>This is the trickier part. Let's focus on the
first line above:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splitwo.png" alt="illustrating line splits (original line)"></p>
<p>This is how the program sees it:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splitw.png" alt="illustrating line splits (annotation)"></p>
<p>OK, this requires some explaining. The program looks at columns of pixels and
computes two things: the <em>height</em> of the column, and the <em>weight</em> of the
column (smoothed over a small window). The height is just the maximal vertical
distance between two non-white pixels on the column, and the weight is the sum
of the pixel's distance to black. We are especially interested in columns that
both have a minimal height and a minimal weight (excluding some outliers, with
some thresholds, etc). Intuitively, these columns are points on the staff where
nothing is happening. These are the purple parts on the picture above: the cyan
parts have small weight but not height, the pink parts have small height but not
weight, and the black parts satisfy neither criterion. (Sorry, these ugly colors
are just what was the easiest to produce -- it's a debug output.)</p>
<p>We can see that both criteria are useful: if we look only at the height (pink
and purple) then we still include columns of staff that are not empty. If we
look only at weight, then we get fooled by some columns that include part of a
note (bars 2 and 3). But when we look at both criteria, the purple parts are a
reasonable approximation of the parts of the score where nothing is happening.
(Note that floating stuff, e.g., the numbers 168 and
169, prevent parts of the staff from being detected as empty.)</p>
<p>Now, it's good to find where nothing is happening, but where can we find bar
lines? The idea is that a bar line is a part of the staff which:</p>
<ul>
<li>is of minimal height but not of minimal weight (pink)</li>
<li>is surrounded to the left and right by points of minimal height and weight (purple)</li>
<li>is <em>narrow</em>, i.e., not too many pixels wide</li>
<li>contains a column with high weight, i.e., significantly higher (by some factor)
  than the weight of columns where nothing happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a complicated collection of criteria, but I didn't have luck with more
naive approaches. My initial idea was just to look for columns having a minimal
height and high weight, but this is fooled by note stems, e.g., of the last
crochet of bar 3. Still, this criterion is fragile, especially with minims as
their notehead is sometimes not heavy enough to be detected; and you have to set
some parameters correctly.</p>
<p>On the example above, this approach correctly detects all bars (vertical lines),
except the double bar at the middle. The blue bar is where the program decided
to cut the line (to fit the width I had requested), and the red lines were
possible cuts that were not used. Here the choice of a cut is simple (take the
closest to the middle), but in more complicated cases the program will try all
possible approaches.</p>
<p>The last thing to do is stretching the chunks to the left and right of the blue
line so that they have the exact same length -- which they currently don't (the
left chunk is much longer than the right chunk). To do this, the program simply
scales all purple regions. We get this (without the colors):</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/page_0018_0000_0000.png" alt="first split">
<img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/page_0018_0000_0001.png" alt="second split"></p>
<p>It's not perfect: the first bar is a bit off, because the program did not
stretch around the "168".<sup id="fnref:songflower_weird"><a href="#fn:songflower_weird">1</a></sup> Also, in a proper edition, the key
would be repeated at the beginning of the second line, which my program doesn't
dot, but well... Other than that, I think it's pretty seamless, and hard to
notice that there was some work involved in bringing these two lines to the same
width.</p>
<p>Of course, this example is a case where the program doesn't perform too badly.
Sometimes, it has a harder time doing something reasonable:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/fail.png" alt="case where the program fails"></p>
<p>One could think of more elaborate approaches to avoid problems, e.g., trying to
identify floating things like "168" or lyrics or other things, process the staff
without taking them into account, and then attach them back to the right place
afterwards...</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>There are a lot of corner cases and other subtleties in the code which I didn't
get into. For instance, when the program doesn't detect enough bar lines, then it
will fall back on cutting on spaces detected to be empty -- this is usually less
disruptive. Performance is also an issue, as the code is in Python: to speed
things up is, I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU parallel</a> to
process multiple pages and lines simultaneously.</p>
<p>Anyway: applying the process to <em>Melodia</em>, fixing a few glitches by tweaking the
parameters on some pages (and adding a title, removing junk, etc.), I got the
<a href="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/melodia_reflow.pdf">reflowed PDF</a> I wanted. It's not perfect at all,
and some of the later pages are quite wild, but well, I'll see to it when/if I
get there. :)</p>
<p>You should be able at least to reflow <em>Melodia</em> to a different format by
grabbing <a href="https://a3nm.net/git/songflower/">the code</a> and running it. Other than that, I'd be
happy to know if you have any luck applying this code to other files! I'm also
interested in patches or ideas if you also find it fun to hack on this.</p>

<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Fear and panic could destroy the city as much as plague itself. Many of the doctors fled, along with the rich and powerful; quacks preyed on the poor with their neverfail miracle drugs. Neighbours informed against each other. People lied to each other – and to themselves. Worse – there were stories of infected people deliberately concealing their telltale ‘tokens’ and going out into the streets trying to infect others.</p><p>-Daniel Defoe, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> (1722)</p></blockquote><h5>Zeynep Tüfekçi is a force of nature whose intellectual range encompasses everything from academic sociology to the impact of social media on society to (more recently) the COVID mask and lockdown debates. Her book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hibL21">Twitter and Tear Gas</a></em> is a now-classic study of Internet-fueled protest, and she continues to write prolifically for <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/zeynep-tufekci">The New York Times</a> </em> and <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zeynep-tufekci/">The Atlantic</a>. </em>In our lengthy interview—I completely ignored Substack warnings about email length—I unveil the jocular coinage ‘zeynepping’ to describe this unique blend of contrarian and wide-ranging embroilment in the burning issues of the day. She and I have had a year-long DM thread where we agree on basically nothing, except perhaps that McLuhan was right about the fundamentally oral dynamics of modern digital media (which we only mention in passing here, because of course we spent most of our time bickering). She agreed to publicize some of our disagreement in the longest <em>Pull Request</em> interview yet. Tüfekçi also recently started <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">her own Substack </a><em><a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">Insight</a></em>.</h5><p><strong>From what you’ve told me, you started your career as a programmer but then you ended up doing a master's degree and PhD. But your claim to fame was the book on Twitter and the Middle East and its various convulsions, is that right?</strong></p><p>My first claim to fame was when Facebook started. It was just seen as a little college thing, and I started writing that it would scramble our understanding of privacy. It was just collapsing a lot of geographic boundaries, and since I was a college teacher, I could see it in the students’ experience; their mental model of what Facebook was and what it actually did to their experience of space and time. I remember one incident: I used to teach intro to sociology and it's a big lecture class, because that's how those things work. So I would assign little group assignments to break up the lecture. What if you were born a different gender? Or what if you were in a different family? Just very simple, simple stuff for students. And they got a passing grade so long as they turned in something. </p><p>So my TA at one point notices that a bunch of them have the same handwriting. Why on earth are they cheating, what is going on? So I called the group into my office, and they say: <em>What a coincidence we all have the same handwriting!</em> And I ask: <em>Do you know each other?</em> <em>No, we don't know each other</em>, they say. And I did something that I don't ever do: I looked them up on Facebook. And of course, they were all friends with each other, so I just showed them Facebook and I said: <em>Look, you're lying to me, you're all friends with each other</em>. They almost fainted in my office because the idea that their friendship could be documented and be visible to the outside world and that Facebook would be a vehicle for this was a completely alien and incomprehensible thing to these kids.</p><p>The most interesting thing to me was how could they not imagine the obvious thing that this is going to scramble their visibility and ruin their denial. They just had no idea. So I started doing some studies…</p><p><strong>What year was this?</strong></p><p>This was before the Arab Spring, I think my first studies where 2007 or 2008-ish?</p><p>I started saying stuff like: <em>Facebook, they're going to scramble privacy, they are changing how we understand primary and secondary social contacts and their visibility</em>. I started arguing that in some ways—and this is something you and I talk about a lot—this is taking people back to a more intrinsically human way of living, in which you don't lose contact with people. This idea that you've graduated from middle school, and then high school, and then go to a different city and never see those people again, that's kind of a weird 20th-century blip: that's not how humans have mostly lived. But at a scale that is not the same as your village or hunter-gatherer experience. It's got a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and it's going to scramble everything. I kept saying this is going to change the fabric of society, these tools are not these things that just sit outside of society. </p><p>And when the Arab Spring hit, then all of a sudden, because I’m from the Middle East, all of a sudden, people were like: <em>Oh, wait, there was somebody talking about this</em>, and everybody wanted an explanation. That’s when I started being able to do my current work as until then universities would hire me because I could do stats and math. The rest has been a blur.</p><p><strong>I recall first reading your work in the wake of the Arab Spring. The Western vibe at the time was definitely: </strong><em><strong>Isn't this just great and amazing?</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Twitter is central to this entire social turmoil</strong></em><strong>! Though in retrospect, it might not have had the centrality that Westerners imagined, in terms of the bigger picture…</strong></p><p>But it actually was really important. What's really funny is that a lot of these people are also my friends and people I had known because of the Middle Eastern democracy and dissident crowds. They got so sick of Western journalists asking them about Twitter and Facebook every day, they would just lie, and say: <em>It had nothing to do with any saying. Stop this bullshit. You know, we don't really use those tools</em>.</p><p>They would literally say that, and then they would be on the backchannel saying:<em> Wait, I think the Twitter trending algorithm changed,</em> because they were disassembling it, and they thought about it a lot. But they got so sick of the navel gazing about it because the West could only relate to them as Twitter users. So I wouldn't say it didn't play a key role: I think it played a major role in the upheaval. But it got framed in the West as a stupid question. You know, <em>was it Twitter or was it the people?</em> I felt like stabbing my eyes out when people ask those kinds of questions, so that's when I start writing about it.</p><h4>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing to the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing to the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></h4><p><strong>Right. So the two claims are: This Twitter/Facebook thing is absolutely central. Again, the only way we can relate to these people is via their Twitter usage, otherwise, the local politics are not of vital interest from the Western perspective. And then secondly, that this was all a magnificent thing.</strong></p><p><strong>But as soon as those same disruptions visit the West in the form of Trump, Brexit, the </strong><em><strong>gilets jaunes</strong></em><strong>, etc. Suddenly: </strong><em><strong>Have we questioned whether overthrowing the state of affairs is actually such a great thing??</strong></em><strong> It's interesting to see the contrast between that sort of narrative and the one in 2016.</strong></p><p>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></p><p>When Obama won in 2012, there were I don't know how many articles talking about how great his use of technology and data was. Which is why I started saying: <em>wait, wait, it's not about your candidate, this might not be that great, and there are all these problems</em>. Interestingly, when I started saying that—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">I wrote that </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">Times </a></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">op-ed</a>, which caused so much grief for me—I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right? I mean, the whole tech world was completely convinced that the other side, so to speak, would never be smart like them. Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em> And of course, anybody who knows history is jumping up and down saying <em>it doesn't do your bidding like that!</em> It's not your little pony that's gonna just destabilize things you happen to dislike at the moment and leave you alone. So here we are.</p><h4>I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right? I mean, the whole tech world was completely convinced that the other side, so to speak, would never be smart like them. Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em></h4><p><strong>You and I both have the same hang ups, because we've had these conversations before, such as the conflict between literacy and orality, the weird warping of geography that social media causes, which to me is one of the biggest things I can't get my head around. </strong></p><p><strong>But just before we leave the topic of the Middle East: One thing <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-prophet-of-the-revolt">I asked Martin Gurri about</a> is how is it that a lot of these movements, unlike previous revolutionary movements, didn't quite congeal into any sort of lasting institutional change. The classic example is Occupy Wall Street and to a lesser extent the </strong><em><strong>Gilets Jaunes</strong></em><strong> which haven't really done anything in the political space. Arguably the only counter example is Spain with Podemos…</strong></p><p>In Spain, the group just broke off. They just said, we're gonna form a political party. And that's it. </p><p>If you skimmed my book, my theory there is that these movements look like past movements, in that they have these big massive street marches. But you're looking at something different, right? So if you look at a past big march, …</p></div></div>

                    <p>250+ Developers, SREs, DevOps, Architects and Product Managers have spoken: they struggle with releasing microservices into production. It remains a costly, manual, error-prone and nail-biting task for software teams. In our report we dive into challenges, trends and opportunities for improvement when it comes to releasing and validating software in production. </p><p>The survey spotlights the stark challenges SMBs and enterprises are facing as they pursue their cloud, Kubernetes and microservices journey. The need for release automation increases as systems become more complex (dependencies, highly distributed, different release frequencies) and the pressure from the business to release software faster (and more frequently) is higher than ever.</p><h3 id="kubernetes-and-microservices-have-become-mainstream">Kubernetes and Microservices Have Become Mainstream</h3><p>72% of participants say that they are using Kubernetes in production today and 16% says that they are evaluating or planning to use Kubernetes. Microservices are even more popular. 81% of participants say that they are using microservices in production today and 14% says they have plans to use microservices.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full report State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="majority-is-still-using-high-risk-release-strategies">Majority Is Still Using High-Risk Release Strategies</h3><p>Releasing in production is the process of taking running code and making it “live” and accessible to users, in a predictable and repeatable way. It's about paying particular attention to ensure that releasing a new version doesn’t result in a worse experience for your users. 86% of participants are still using high-risk release strategies such as rolling update, blue-green and big-bang releases. There is a strong lack of canary releasing capabilities with only 9% of participants using this low-risk release strategy. Canary releasing limits the number of users exposed to a bad release (known as limiting the blast radius) by gradually rolling out a new version of a service to a small, representative subgroup of <em><em>real</em></em> user traffic before rolling it out to the entire user base.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="release-validation-and-rollbacks-remain-a-manual-time-consuming-task">Release Validation and Rollbacks Remain A Manual, Time-Consuming Task</h3><p>Release validation is the process of making sure that released software that’s running in production is meeting the requirements in terms of performance, quality, customer experience and business KPIs. On average it takes 2.2 hours with 4 people engaged during the release validation process.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-blog.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Rollbacks are a critical part of your release strategy. When implemented right, it creates a safety net to protect your software teams and minimize the impact on the customer experience when issues are starting to occur. 53% of rollbacks are done manually with an average time to rollback of 45 minutes.</p><h3 id="dependency-management-is-the-biggest-challenge-when-it-comes-to-releasing-microservices">Dependency Management Is The Biggest Challenge When It Comes To Releasing Microservices</h3><p>The report revealed that dependency management is the biggest challenge when it comes to releasing microservices in production.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the recently published <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">“Security Chaos Engineering” e-book</a>, one of the chapters I wrote covers attacker math and the power of decision trees to guide more pragmatic threat modelling. This post will walk through creating the example decision tree from the e-book using <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> and a .DOT file.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Using this as a reference, you can extrapolate this process into a pattern to inform saner security prioritization during the design phase of the product lifecycle. I won’t cover how to populate your own decision tree in this post since that is already covered in the e-book, which is immediately available at your fingertips for the delectable price of free.</p>
<p>As an apéritif, here’s the end result towards which we’ll be building:</p>
<p><img src="https://swagitda.com/blog/img/graphviz/attack-tree-15.png" alt="The final decision tree for threat modeling an S3 bucket containing sensitive data"></p>
<h2 id="a-brief-intro-on-graphviz">A brief intro on Graphviz</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, Graphviz is a graph visualization tool. It is open source, which was especially compelling as I tried out various graphing tools for the decision tree use case because I am a ho for not spending money.</p>
<p>Graphviz takes descriptions of graphs in text form and converts them into a visual (like an image or PDF). I found that the default styling options for Graphviz can quickly look like a hybrid of the infamous <a href="https://twitter.com/defensecharts">defense charts</a> or the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/graphic-design-is-my-passion">“graphic design is my passion” meme</a>. However, these style deficiencies are balanced by the ease of editing the relationships represented in the graph – an issue I previously found tedious when using GUI-based tools.</p>
<p>The textual descriptions of the graph are written using the <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT language</a> (and thereby saved as a .DOT file). I personally found it quite intuitive, though, as always, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-decision-tree">Building the decision tree</h2>
<p>For those of you who haven’t read the report yet (reminder: <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">it’s free</a>), let’s set some background context on this example.</p>
<p>Organizations often store important content in cloud storage buckets. In this example, our imaginary organization wants to store customer video recordings in an S3 bucket. As the product and engineering teams think through the design of this project, they want to avoid bad things happening to the project that could cost money (whether via downtime or compliance fines) or time (which is also money)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The (rather obvious) way attackers win is by successfully accessing the video recordings in the S3 bucket. Thus, the decision tree shows the potential paths attackers can take, including attacker actions performed in response to defensive actions or mitigations, to reach the goal of accessing that S3 bucket.</p>
<p>The branches of the tree are oriented from the lowest cost paths to attackers (on the left) to the most expensive attacker paths (on the right). The lowest cost path for attackers is generally the one with zero defensive mitigations in place, what I <a href="https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/on-yolosec-and-fomosec/">affectionately call “yolosec."</a> The highest cost path for attackers usually involves finding and exploiting zero day vulnerabilities or performing upstream supply chain attacks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you want to understand more about the decision tree architecture, I entreat you yet again to <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">download the Security Chaos Engineering report</a>.</p>
<h2 id="step-1---defining-the-basic-nodes">Step 1 - Defining the basic nodes</h2>
<p>The most basic security decision tree will have two common states: Reality (the starting node from which all others descend)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and Attackers Win (the ending node reflecting attackers accomplishing their goal).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>All the branches on the tree – reflecting different cost paths – will end up connecting the Reality and Attackers Win nodes in some fashion.</p>
<p>Let’s define these states in a .dot file (I named mine <code>sce-tree.dot</code>). We’re going to be using a <em>digraph</em>, which is short for “directed graph.” Directed graphs show one-way relationships, whereas undirected graphs show symmetrical relationships.</p>
<p>Your initial code thus looks like:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	reality
	attack_win 
}
</code></pre><p><code>reality</code> and <code>attack_win</code> are our first two nodes. We don’t have any attributes for them yet (styling will <a href="#step-8---beautifying-the-graph">come later</a>), so it looks pretty plain.</p>
<p>In this example, we know that the asset we’re threat modelling is the S3 bucket with video recordings, so we can apply a label to the <code>attack_win</code> node saying as much. That way, when the graph is visualized, the node will read as “Access video recordings in S3 bucket” rather than “attack_win”.</p>
<p>To create this label, we add brackets after the relevant node to contain the attribute <code>label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket"</code>. There are a <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html">bunch of attributes</a> you can assign to nodes (like styling), but we’ll cover more of those later.</p>
<p>For now, the foundation for our threat model decision tree looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]
}
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2---creating-the-first-attack-node">Step 2 - Creating the first attack node</h2>
<p>The first branch in the decision tree should represent the lowest cost attack path. In the example from <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">the SCE report</a>, the branch barely involves an attack – it assumes #yolosec, representing a reality in which you’ve allowed crawling on your sitemap, enabling cache APIs (like the Wayback machine) to create caches of the bucket’s contents.</p>
<p>This means our first attack node is actually more of a state of being. The only attacker action is to access this API cache, for which we will create a new node:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]

	// attack nodes
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]
}
</code></pre><p>You have a few options for how you want to define the nodes in your decision tree. Above, I defined the node as <code>attack_1</code>, since I personally find it easier to keep track of attack (and defense) actions sequentially. However, you can also define the nodes more explicitly, such as <code>api_cache</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><code>	// attack nodes
	api_cache [ label="API cache (e.g. via Wayback machine)" ]
	toothbrush_0day [ label="0day in your electric toothbrush" ]
	planet_hax [ label="Hack the planet!"]
}
</code></pre><p>You can also use letters, like <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc., but I personally find it crude and harder to follow relative to the more descriptive options as the tree gets more complex.</p>
<p>You’ll also note I’ve commented the heading <code>// attack nodes</code>. I find it easier to separate out attack vs. defense nodes, especially when it comes to styling (as we’ll see first in <a href="#step-6---differentiating-between-attack--defense-nodes">step 6</a>). Another option is to organize your nodes within the .dot file by branch, such as:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]

	// branch 1
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. via Wayback machine)" ]
	defense_1 [ label="#yolosec" ]

	// branch 2
	attack_2 [ label="0day in your electric toothbrush" ]
	defense_2 [ label="roll over and play dead" ]
}
</code></pre><p>Whatever your preference, just make sure you’re consistent as you continue to build out the tree. Also note that Graphviz does <em>not</em> warn you if there are duplicate nodes, so choose whichever organization option will minimize the probability of you creating duplicates.</p>
<h2 id="step-3---creating-the-first-branch-edges">Step 3 - Creating the first branch edges</h2>
<p>Because I’m impatient and maybe you are, too, let’s work towards visualizing this first branch so we can see something tangible from our efforts thus far. This means we need to create the <em>edges</em> for the first branch.</p>
<p>Edges are the connectors between nodes. Because our decision trees are causal diagrams, we’ll be using the <code>-&gt;</code> edge (i.e. arrowhead edge) to represent a directional flow of action.</p>
<p>In the case of this first branch, we start from the reality node, which connects to the #yolosec state of an API cache existing, which leads to attackers successfully accessing the bucket data (and thus winning). In our .dot file, these edges will be defined like this:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]

	// attack nodes
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]

	// branch 1 edges
	reality -&gt; attack_1
	attack_1 -&gt; attack_win
}
</code></pre><p>If you want to highlight what a snafu the API cache is, you can even add a “#yolosec” label (via <code>xlabel=</code>) to the edge:</p>
<pre><code>reality -&gt; attack_1 [ xlabel="#yolosec" ]
attack_1 -&gt; attack_win
</code></pre><h2 id="step-4---visualizing-the-first-branch">Step 4 - Visualizing the first branch</h2>
<p>Now that we have the necessary nodes and edges for our first branch, let’s visualize it! Spoiler alert: without any styling, it’s not going to look too pretty.</p>
<p>I find a PDF to be the most digestible format for decision trees, since it allows better zooming and panning than an image (like a .png). However, for obvious reasons, I’ll be using .png’s to illustrate the results of each command throughout this post.</p>
<p>To create a PDF of our decision tree thus far, we can use the command:
<code>dot -Tpdf sce-tree.dot -o attack-tree.pdf</code></p>
<p><img src="https://swagitda.com/blog/img/graphviz/attack-tree-01.png" alt="First branch of our decision tree"></p>
<p>That is super hideous! But we successfully visualized that a reality in which an API cache of our video recordings is available leads to attackers winning with minimal effort (with the #yolosec tag for extra flair).</p>
<h2 id="step-5---filling-out-another-branch">Step 5 - Filling out another branch</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to add another branch. This will involve creating new attack nodes, defense nodes, and edges between them.</p>
<p>Because we learned our lesson on the dangers of #yolosec, we know that we should implement the mitigation of disallowing crawling on our site maps. This will be our first defense node:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket (attackers win)" ]

	// attack nodes
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]

	// defense nodes
	defense_1 [ label="Disallow crawling on site maps" ]

	// branch 1 edges
	reality -&gt; attack_1 [ xlabel="#yolosec" ]
	attack_1 -&gt; attack_win
}
</code></pre><p>As discussed in <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">the SCE report</a>, we next need to think about how an attacker will respond to our mitigations (what is known as “belief prompting”). The easiest thing an attacker can do next, if an API cache isn’t available, is searching public buckets to see if the target data is accessible. This will be our second node among our attack nodes:</p>
<pre><code>// attack nodes
attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]
attack_2 [ label="AWS public buckets search" ]
</code></pre><p>We will again …</p></div></div>

					<div><p>Bellinzona, 25.01.2021 – The Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB; Bellinzona, Switzerland), affiliated to the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) developed a second-generation ‘double antibody’ that protects from SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and all its tested variants. It also prevents the virus from mutating to resist the therapy.</p><p>Antibody-based immunotherapy was already shown to be effective against COVID-19 but faces two main obstacles: it needs to work against the circulating viral variants; it must prevent formation of new variants, that can rapidly ensue via a mechanism similar to that leading to antibiotic resistant bacteria. We solved the problem by joining two natural antibodies into a single artificial molecule, called ‘bispecific antibody’, that targets two independent viral sites simultaneously.</p><p>Pre-clinical trials showed that this bispecific antibody potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including the recent UK one circulating in Switzerland and Europe with increased spread. The bispecific, but not first-generation antibodies, prevents the virus from changing its structure to evade therapy. The high bispecific potency and its overall characteristics make it an ideal candidate for human clinical trials, with good chances of employment both for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p><p>“We exploited our knowledge of the molecular structure and biochemical traits of the virus to fuse together two human antibodies, obtaining a single bispecific molecule simultaneously attacking the virus in two independent sites critical for infectivity”, said <strong>Luca Varani</strong>, group leader at the IRB and author of the scientific work. “Supercomputing simulations allowed us to refine and validate the bispecific antibody design, which was later produced and tested in the laboratory. Although the virus can mutate and escape from the attack of a single first-generation antibody, we have shown that it cannot do so against the double action of the bispecific’.</p><p><strong>Davide Robbiani</strong>, IRB director and co-author of the scientific work, commented:” IRB and Ticino consolidate their position among the world leaders in antibody discovery and development, especially against emerging and neglected infectious diseases. Despite the limited resources, in comparison to big-pharma, we achieved our goals in just a few months’.</p><p>“A single injection of the bispecific antibody provides instantaneous protection against the disease in pre-clinical trials. The antibody effectively reduces viral burden in the lungs and mitigates inflammation typical of COVID-19”, said <strong>Daniel Ruzek</strong> from the Czech Academy of Sciences who led the antibody pre-clinical testing.</p><p>The bispecific antibody was developed within the <strong>research consortium ATAC, funded <a href="https://www.irb.usi.ch/news/covid-19-irb-receives-eu-emergency-research-funding/">last April</a> from the European Commission</strong> in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other members include San Matteo Hospital in Pavia (Italy), Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), Braunschweig University (Germany) and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. Collaboration with Rockfeller University and the Czech Academy of Science was instrumental to prove the bispecific efficacy.</p><p>The Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) in Bellinzona, affiliated to the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) performed basic research for more than 20 years. Financed by private and public institutions, and by competitive grants, the IRB currently hosts 13 research groups and 125 researchers that investigate the mechanisms of host defence against infectious agents, cancer and degenerative diseases. Currently, the research activities extend beyond immunology to include the fields of DNA repair, rare diseases, structural and cell biology.

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project.

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><blockquote>
<p>Today we announced our <a href="https://vectorized.io/press/2021-01-26">Series A Financing</a> to enable us <a href="https://vectorized.io/cloud">to expand our cloud service</a> (sign up for early preview!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the last two years we have been working towards The <em>Intelligent Data API</em>: a way to turn data streams into data products. </p>
<p>Today, Jan 26th, 2021 the world is very different from what it was 10+ years ago, when the majority of data streaming technologies were invented. A decade ago, the bottleneck was disk- ‘ye olde spinning hard drives. The slowness of spinning disks dominated how storage systems were built, because a single misstep would cause your users to experience massive delays. Today’s hardware is like the new Avengers comics, every part is so vastly improved it is hardly recognizable - with modern disks being the new Captain Marvel, 1000x faster. </p>
<p>Over this same decade, we saw the rising need for enterprises to react in real time to the ever increasing data volume, velocity and variety. It was us, consumers, using a phone application anywhere in the world, and being able to hail a cab without speaking the foreign language. Or us, consumers, purchasing a movie on a transatlantic flight and expecting that our credit card would detect a fraudulent transaction due to a double charge, even if it happened mid air at 560 miles per hour all while crossing country boundaries. These expectations have, in a transitive sense, created a renaissance in the real-time infrastructure that powers these businesses. Whether you are combining taxi-driver demand, customer presence with surge pricing or merging 25 different data sources to detect a fraudulent transaction, customers expect you to react to events now in real time.</p>
<p>However, once you decide to move your infrastructure towards an event-driven paradigm, you will soon find yourself drowning in complexity on how to actually operationalize open source components at scale. That’s why we created the Intelligent Data API, a developer centric environment for transforming realtime streams into products, with new primitives for unifying historical and real time data as well as modern day store-procedures for streaming.</p>
<h2 id="The-Intelligent-Data-API-has-3-parts">The Intelligent Data API has 3 parts.<a href="#The-Intelligent-Data-API-has-3-parts" aria-label="The Intelligent Data API has 3 parts permalink"></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Compatibility with the largest data streaming ecosystem (Kafka-API)</li>
<li>Unification of historical and real time data (Shadow Indexing)</li>
<li>Stateful stored-procedures for streaming data (WASM)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/c4248dc50a7bfc9adb47d3d24b393bef/ida.svg" alt="ida"></p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Compatibility-with-the-largest-data-streaming-ecosystem---The-Kafka-API">Part 1: Compatibility with the largest data streaming ecosystem - The Kafka API<a href="#Part-1-Compatibility-with-the-largest-data-streaming-ecosystem---The-Kafka-API" aria-label="Part 1 Compatibility with the largest data streaming ecosystem   The Kafka API permalink"></a></h3>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/b75f9269fcb81f00a2409b2157861d4b/kafka-compat.svg" alt="compat"></p>
<p>Let’s be clear, engineers absolutely love the Kafka-API. What they love is the fact that they can take TensorFlow, Spark Streaming, and ElasticSearch and have a sophisticated fraud detection pipeline. They love the empowerment of the millions of lines of code the community has built over the years, allowing them to build entire products overnight.  It is no secret, however, that to run and operate Kafka and Zookeeper at scale requires a team of dedicated distributed systems engineers, not working on product features, but managing infrastructure. </p>
<p>Our first step towards building the Intelligent Data API was first to build the <a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/validating-consistency/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">most reliable</a> Kafka-API compatible streaming platform in the world. One that would require <em>no code changes to existing enterprise applications</em> and a platform that was able to squeeze every single ounce of performance out of modern hardware. </p>
<p>What’s more is we wanted to build this in the open under a <a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/open-source/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Free and Source Available License</a> - BSL - taking inspiration from our friends at CockroachDB. Redpanda is a new storage engine with one licensing limitation: we are the only company allowed to offer <a href="https://vectorized.io/redpanda" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Redpanda</a> as a SaaS. Other than that, we wanted to empower every single Kafka-API user to build upon a new storage engine optimized for the new world of superscalar CPUs, 100Gbps NICs and NVMe access times in the low double digit microseconds. </p>
<h3 id="Part-2-Unification-of-historical-and-real-time-data-Shadow-Indexing">Part 2: Unification of historical and real time data (Shadow Indexing)<a href="#Part-2-Unification-of-historical-and-real-time-data-Shadow-Indexing" aria-label="Part 2 Unification of historical and real time data Shadow Indexing permalink"></a></h3>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/abad95a3c37a96b21a3eedc63a24c07b/shadow-index.svg" alt="compat"></p>
<p>Amazon S3 officially launched in 2006. 15 years later and trillions of objects stored, we now have reliable infinite storage. This cheap, infinitely scalable storage is what people call the Data Lake. Think of it like your uncle Larry’s doomsday basement. You put everything in it, with no structure, hoping that one day you can take advantage of it (Larry, if you are reading this, no shame!). In more formal terms, it is a central repository of data with an Object-based API that is infinitely scalable. For developers it provides a simple way to achieve disaster recovery. Within seconds of uploading a file to S3 you get eleven-nines of durability. That’s 99.999999999% probability that after storing 10’000 objects you might lose one in 10 million years. It is an engineering marvel in my opinion. </p>
<p>Redpanda eliminates the need for disaster recovery by integrating with these infinitely scalable storage systems. Instead of deleting data locally, it will push the old segments onto S3 and fetch them when clients need them. On the surface this sounds like the obvious solution in a cloud native world, but what it does for enterprises is that it unifies the way you access and manage both historical and real-time data without changing a single line of code in your application!</p>
<p>We call this feature Shadow Indexing because it doesn’t keep the historical data on local disks, instead it keeps a location reference of how and where to fetch the data should a Kafka-API client request it. What enterprises are the most excited about, however, is the fact that you can spin up a new Redpanda cluster and replay petabytes of data to retrain your machine learning model without affecting your production cluster or changing any code. In a way, this presents a true disaggregation of compute and store for streaming data. </p>
<h3 id="Part-3-Ship-code-to-data">Part 3: Ship code to data<a href="#Part-3-Ship-code-to-data" aria-label="Part 3 Ship code to data permalink"></a></h3>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/58597a221eeb649d195cd813c95b19ca/code-to-data.svg" alt="compat"></p>
<p>As data accumulates, it builds sort of a gravitational pull, attracting applications to interact with it, in turn generating more data. The more data is collected, the stronger the pull for other applications to interact with it, ad infinitum. If you are a developer working with real-time data streaming applications you understand that as soon as a component touches Kafka or in our case Redpanda, the higher the propensity for applications interacting with it to also integrate with the Kafka-API. In fact, the system was explicitly designed from day-0 to be a way to decouple multiple disparate systems and API’s by simply using the Kafka-API. Redpanda, through the Kafka-API, is a viral primitive, one that is scalable, secure, fast, durable, replayable and integrates with just about every single other data framework in existence today. </p>
<p>Instead of fighting data gravity, Redpanda inverts the typical paradigm of sending data to compute frameworks like Spark Streaming, etc and instead allows developers to ship code to the storage engine. At the lowest level we use WebAssembly, an intermediary language that allows software engineers to write and edit code in their favorite programming language to perform one-shot transformations, like guaranteeing GDPR compliance by removing personal information or to provide filtering and simple aggregation functions. Think of these transformations as the modern day stored-procedures for streaming data.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we are developing Redpanda in the open is because we believe in the power of community. Today, we are happy to announce that we will be releasing our WASM engine as part of the BSL license on GitHub. While the Kafka API is ready for production, and we hope you put us through the paces, Shadow Indexing and WASM are still in experimental mode but we invite you to try them! </p>
<p>Please join us on <a href="https://vectorized.io/slack" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Slack</a> or if this is the kind of technology you want to hack on, we are <a href="https://vectorized.io/careers" target="_self" rel="nofollow">hiring</a>.  From all of us at Vectorized, we hope to see you soon! </p></section></div></div>]]>

<ul>
<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>
</ul>

</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed

<li>we perform a similar attack as our TCP segmentation, but over UDP as IP fragmentation will occur and provide different values than TCP segmentation</li>
<li>victim MTU size, IP header size, IP packet size, TCP header size, TCP segment sizes detected by server and sent back to victim's browser, used later for packet stuffing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v1) "SIP packet" in new hidden form generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking

<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP or H.323 packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>(v2) as H.323 call forwarding can direct to any other IP, packet can contain any internal IP of any other host on the victim's network, triggering the NAT to port forward to any system on the network</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine (or other machine on the network, entirely determined by attacker) opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP/H.323 packet </li>
<li><b>attacker can now bypass victim NAT and connect directly back to any port on any machine on the network, exposing previously protected/hidden services and systems</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New research gives patients with <span>PTSD</span> the power to restore their own patterns of brain activity</p><div>
    <div>
          <div property="content:encoded"><p><strong>LHSC: University Hospital&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a new study at Lawson Health Research Institute (Lawson) and the University of Geneva, researchers showed that a technique called brain training can be used to restore patterns of brain activity and reduce symptoms of hyperarousal in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (<span>PTSD</span>).</p>
<p>Individuals with <span>PTSD</span> often experience more random patterns of brain activity. A leading symptom of <span>PTSD</span> is hyperarousal, which is associated with defensive responses to stress or triggers. A technique to restore patterns of brain activity to a more balanced order and reduce hyperarousal therefore holds promise as a potential treatment.</p>
<p>With the brain training technique, also called neurofeedback, patients exercise their own brain activity through a circular neurofeedback loop, which acts as a mirror to display brain activity. This is done through a brain-computer interface that records brain signals through sensors on the scalp. Since brain activity is displayed on screen, users can complete brain training exercises in ways similar to a gym workout.</p>
<p>In this study, led by Lawson’s Dr. Ruth Lanius, the goal was for patients with <span>PTSD</span> to reduce the intensity of the brain’s dominant brain wave - the alpha rhythm. Patients used neurofeedback to visualize their brain activity as they played a simple video training game. The 30-minute game consisted of a space ship displayed on a starry background. When patients were successful in reducing their alpha rhythm, the space ship moved forward.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Patients reported reducing the dominant brain wave by concentrating their attention towards the visuals on screen. This seemed to propel the spaceship forward,” said Dr. Ruth Lanius, a scientist at Lawson and a psychiatrist at London Health Sciences Centre. “This is consistent with prior research that suggests the alpha rhythm is reduced with increased processing of attention.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers were surprised to find the reduction in alpha rhythm resulted in lasting changes. After the initial reduction, the alpha rhythm rebounded, or increased, to levels matching those found in healthy individuals. Patterns of brain activity were restored to a more proportional balance that is associated with healthy brain function.</p>
<p>Following&nbsp;these sessions, patients experienced a decrease in hyperarousal. “This is very significant. Neurofeedback may give patients the power to restore their patterns of brain activity and improve symptoms of psychiatric illness,” said Dr. Lanius, who is also a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine <span>&amp;</span> Dentistry. “This means that existing mechanisms of the human brain may be harnessed for therapy, providing an alternative to pharmaceutical and brain stimulation therapies.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lanius and her collaborators are currently continuing this research with a larger group of patients with <span>PTSD</span>. Patients in this study will complete multiple sessions of brain training to determine whether positive effects can be sustained long-term.</p>
<p>The study, “<a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/12/cercor.bhw285.abstract" rel="nofollow">Neurofeedback tunes scale-free dynamics in spontaneous brain activity</a>”, was published in the journal <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>20,000 had died as a result of the tsunami by the time I spoke with Joi. Three reactor cores had melted. Unknown to most at the time, sixteen radioactive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49379-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plumes</a> were sweeping across the Fukushima countryside. Families across the nation, some being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253930/table/tab_6-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocated</a> and all glued to the news, were asking: Are we safe? Should we stay indoors? Can our children drink the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milk</a>?</p>
<p>There were no clear answers, but there was plenty of speculation. Datasets available to the government and power company were withheld from the public. Scientists across the world, eager to evaluate the situation, were left guessing.</p>
<p>That day in March 2011, Joi told me that he and a small cast of characters had assembled a rough plan for <em>Open Global Sensing</em>. I’d just left Microsoft where, in my role as Chief Software Architect, I’d started and nurtured a new product called <em>Azure</em>. “We could use your cloud and data expertise. Will you join us?</p>

<p>A few weeks later 15 of us <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seanbonner/5629245498/in/album-72157626383390989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met</a> in Tokyo, came together around a mission, and set off to Akihabara. Within days, a volunteer’s car had been <a href="https://safecast.org/2011/04/first-safecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed</a> with a laptop, a GPS, and a high-quality Geiger counter. The team began mapping radiation levels and uploading them as CC0-licensed data for all the world to see. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0434-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizens became scientists</a>, and <a href="https://safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> was born.</p>

<p>Over 10 years, using more than two thousand sensors, more than ten thousand volunteers have worked to gather a <a href="https://map.safecast.org/?y=37.28&amp;x=139.7&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly growing dataset and map</a> of hundreds of millions of data points. During that time, the team has used commercial IoT technology to create <a href="https://safecast.org/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten generations of sensors</a> – some fixed, some mobile. Some measuring radiation, some air quality. Some hard-wired, some solar powered. With support of several <a href="https://safecast.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous benefactors</a>, Safecast’s citizen scientist volunteers have managed to build one of the largest open environmental datasets in existence.</p>

<p>But gathering that data was far, far too difficult. If we’re to benefit from a world of devices that are cloud-connected from birth, IoT needs a new soul.</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-public-airwaves">Surfing the Public Airwaves</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low data-rate applications don’t need the complexity of Linux, containers, or edge computing. For these solutions, AI/ML is best done in the cloud, with microcontroller-based device design focused on simplicity, reliability, low power, and low cost.</p>
<p>The earliest Safecast devices recorded their data onto SD cards. We embraced Bluetooth for mobile phone-based upload, and then <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRa</a> and <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRaWAN</a> for fixed location backhaul. LoRa is an amazing technology, and we came close to becoming addicted due to its low power and low cost. But being a global project with a low density of devices, each time we deployed a sensor we ended up needing to build our own network – a consuming undertaking that was greatly complicated by the fact that LoRa chips and concentrators and spectrum rules vary around the world.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was to use the globally-harmonized public airwaves of cellular.</p>
<p>But what a nightmare! Cellular has huge power draw; it’s a significant challenge for hardware developers to build battery-powered cellular devices. Cellular modems have arcane interfaces and are extremely awkward for developers to deal with. Carriers and cloud providers now (rightfully) require device certificates, TLS, and firmware update, adding even more complexity to the simple task of uploading just a little bit of data.</p>
<p>What’s more, the cellular business model of charging “per month per device” is fundamentally flawed for narrowband cellular IoT, where devices are very high-volume, low-cost, and may even be discarded. Charge the user? Charge the vendor? Charge even when it’s broken? I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product. For the user, <em>it just works</em>.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-data-pump">A Simple Data Pump</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many applications – including Safecasts’s – all you need is a simple <em>data pump</em>. Take a little bit of data, perhaps hourly or daily, format it in a simple way, like JSON, and deliver it securely to a cloud-based app via REST. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>Before investing more time and energy on this problem at Safecast, I began to talk to others in the industry. Does anybody have a simple way of dealing with low-power cellular from a developer perspective? No one did.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to talk with a number of the thousands of commercial and industrial customers I’ve met with over the years. I heard horror stories about how they tried cellular and gave up. Stories of how they tried Wi-Fi, and now want to bail because it’s a complete <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/a-smart-refrigerator-can-take-down-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cesspool</a>. To a customer, they were all stories of frustration.</p>
<p>I happen to be very close to the leadership of a few cellular carriers, and so I pressed them: How are you (as an industry) going to realize the promise of cellular if it’s so difficult for developers to use?</p>
<p>Their answer? “We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.”</p>
<p>And so began another journey.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In building Lotus Notes, Groove, and Talko, I’ve spent decades of my career building software in the field of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/computer-supported-cooperative-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</a>. In the soul of that software was the aspiration to improve outcomes by qualitatively improving interactions among co-workers.</p>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>. Distributed networks of sensors can enable us to know what’s happening in our environment; in our fleets; in our patients; in the COVID vaccination delivery chain; in our food supply; in our HVAC systems; at the entrances to our offices.</p>
<p>Sensors and controls will be ubiquitous in business. They should give us greater <em>situational awareness</em> and should empower us to work together more effectively and serve customers more effectively.</p>
<p>In starting and leading Blues Wireless, my objective is to make it possible for every organization to be able to collaborate with machines to improve their business and improve the world, through visibility, transparency, and control.</p>
<p>We’ve built a few new components – the <a href="https://blues.io/products/"><em>Notecard</em></a> and the <a href="https://notehub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Notehub</em></a> – that have the potential to fundamentally change the game in the cellular world. With its Safecast roots, simplicity and <em>IoT for good</em> are at the soul of the Notecard.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/notecard.png" alt="Close-up photo of the Notecard."> <figcaption>
            <p>Our first product, the Notecard.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But with my own roots being in the commercial world, they’re packaged it in a form that you can use to embed this <em>cloud data pump</em> in your product. Your machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps something that notifies you when a rodent trap or dumpster needs to be emptied, to keep our alleys clean. Or something that sends an alert when the power goes out on a fridge full of medication. Or something that takes action when a low-income tenant’s home gets too cold.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with fancy expensive devices that do edge computing and local AI, but we love dumb old devices at Blues. We love ‘brownfield’ and we love retrofits. The simpler, the cheaper, the broader, the better.</p>
<p>Because it’s our dream that by monitoring the environment at a personal, grassroots level, we can be better educated and in touch with our earth. We’re committed to help make that happen.</p>
<p>But it’s also our dream that by adding simple inexpensive monitors for our food, our fuel, our fridges, our health, that the benefits of the ‘cloud’ and the ‘edge’ can extend to everyone, including the old, the disadvantaged, and the under-served.</p>
<p>It’s our dream that once you see how easy it is to make your product <em>cloud connected from birth</em>, that this little cloud data pump – the Notecard – might <em>itself</em> turn out to be the soul of a new machine: yours.</p>

    <div id="postcontent">
  <p>Now that many more people are joining <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>, some interesting new privacy concerns about its contact discovery and notification protocol are popping up. In particular, people are surprised other people that are (no longer) in their contact list can still discover them when the join Signal. Moreover, some people that join Signal are annoyed that other people are automatically notified of this fact.</p>
  <p>Let me be clear: <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">Signal makes pretty sure</a> that Signal itself cannot learn who is connected with who. The problem is with the way people expect contact discovery works, and how it actually works. And with a lack of control over how discovery works, and who gets notified of what.</p>
  <p>The way Signal <em>contact discovery</em> works is as follows. When your register, a hash of your phone number is stored by Signal. Every once in a while, your Signal app computes a hash of all phone numbers in your contact list, and sends this list to Signal. Signal compares this list with the list of hashes of known registered users, and tells your app of any matches. The contacts that match are added to the Signal’s own address book.</p>
  <p>This means that if <em>your</em> number is on <em>my</em> contact list, your number will be added to Signal’s own address book on my phone, and I will be able to contact you via Signal. This happens even if <em>my</em> number is (no longer) in your contact list. On top of that, Signal <em>notifies</em> me when a person in my contact list joins Signal (again irrespective of whether I appear in that person’s contact list). This is not necessarily what people expect.</p>
  <p>Some people would only want to be discovered by people that are on their own contact list. And not be unknown people that happen to know their phone number, or by people that they used to know but parted ways with (these could be partners, but also previous colleagues, or patients). Moreover, notification of discovering new contacts should be optional, that is: the person <em>discovered</em> should be able to control whether others are notified of this fact.</p>
  <p>Indeed Signal’s matching process could be made such that people are only notified if <em>both</em> have the other person’s number in the contact list. But note that Signal would be next to unusable if I would not be able to tell at all whether you are on Signal if I want to send you a message with it - if you would be able to block discovery of your number, you would never receive a Signal message. So there is a privacy versus usability trade-off there. It would be good to allow users to choose their own position regarding that trade- off. You might even want to offer users the option to make a selection of their contacts available for discovery, meaning that only selected contacts will ever know that you are on Signal, and can contact you there.</p>
  <p>Regarding notification, note that even if Signal would not notify users of new contacts, users could very easily test whether someone in their contact list is on Signal (by trying to send a message and see what happens). With some clever scripting (malicious) users could easily automate this. But as almost all users will not try this for real, limiting notifications actually matters in practice. Again something that should be implemented.</p>
  <p>Note there are other, more privacy friendly, ways to establish contact and send messages anonymously (note that once you exchange messages the Signal server by necessity learns the social graph). The underlying issue is that all these services use phone numbers as contact points. You’d rather use something more ephemeral to establish contact, something that is not public, and something that you can revoke for particular contacts. See <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2808138.2808142">this paper</a> I wrote five years ago (<a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/publications/abb-wpes.pdf">open access pdf version</a>).</p>
  <p>(This blog post was based on some Twitter discussions. See <a href="https://twitter.com/DorotheaBaur/status/1349340273357291528">this tweet</a> and all its branches.)</p>
  <p>P.S.: Interestingly enough a matching algorithm that only discovers contacts when both <span><em>A</em></span>’s number is in <span><em>B</em></span>’s list of contacts and vice versa is inherently more privacy friendly.</p>
  <p>Let <span><em>C</em>(<em>A</em>)</span> denote the list of phone numbers on the contact list of <span><em>A</em></span>. Let <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em></span> be a key derivation function, i.e.&nbsp;a hash function that takes a considerable time to compute. Because of this, when given <span><em>O</em> = <em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>I</em>)</span> it is impossible to do a brute force search for <span><em>I</em></span>. But of course you can still test a suspicion for <span><em>I</em></span> to see if <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>I</em>)</span> matches <span><em>O</em></span>.</p>
  <p>Define <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> to be <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>A</em>|<em>B</em>)</span>.</p>
  <p>The basic algorithm would run as follows.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Round 1:
  <ul>
  <li>At regular time slots (each day, or week), each device with phone number <span><em>A</em></span> computes <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>, and sends <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> to the server.</li>
  <li>The server stores these values <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Round 2:
  <ul>
  <li>When all devices are done executing the first round, each device with phone number <span><em>A</em></span> now computes <span><em>S</em><sub><em>B</em><em>A</em></sub></span>, and sends <span><em>S</em><sub><em>B</em><em>A</em></sub></span> to the server.</li>
  <li>If the value the server now receives is in the database constructed in the first round, it notifies <span><em>A</em></span> of this fact. <span><em>A</em></span> thus discovers <span><em>B</em></span>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>After these two rounds, the server destroys the database.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If <span><em>A</em></span> discovers <span><em>B</em></span>, this means that <span><em>B</em></span> sent <span><em>S</em><sub><em>B</em><em>A</em></sub></span> in the first round. A also must have sent <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> in the first round. As <span><em>B</em></span> will also send <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> in the second round, <span><em>B</em></span> will also discover <span><em>A</em></span>.</p>
  <p>Note that this way it becomes harder for the server to search for users that registered for the service. Instead of trying to brute force search for <span><em>A</em></span> that matches a hash of <span><em>A</em></span>, now the server has to brute force for all possible combinations of <span><em>A</em></span> and <span><em>B</em></span>. Even testing whether a suspicion that <span><em>A</em></span> joined the service becomes harder, because you either have to know a contact <span><em>B</em></span> of <span><em>A</em></span> (and test <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>A</em>|<em>B</em>)</span>, or brute force this for all possible values of <span><em>B</em></span>.</p>

<p>At the start of December, I switched jobs to a new games company. While I really enjoyed being a lead programmer at my previous company, I found it difficult to combine both my leadership and programming responsibilities. I ended up feeling like I wasn’t doing my best work on either. My calendar often looked like Swiss cheese, with small meetings interspersed throughout my day. I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code.</p>



<p>But since my new job didn’t start for another six weeks, I decided to run an experiment on myself. I’ve always been curious about whether an 8-hour workday was actually optimal for me. Now that I had no boss to report to and no coworkers to keep in the loop, why not try cutting my work hours in half? My hope was that I would be able to achieve some kind of momentum on my personal project. I’m happy to report this was definitely the case and that I’ve learned a lot, more than can fit in a single blog post!</p>

<p>My game <em>Up There They Love</em> has been in production in some shape or form for almost three years now. While I had always intended for it to be a “forever project”, something that I could always return to when inspiration struck, it also felt kind of stuck in development hell. Games are meant to be played and I never got to the point where players could actually do that.</p>



<p>To explain it briefly, <em>Up There They Love</em> is an adult visual novel combined with a character management sim and a sexy card game. I designed all of the mechanics, programmed the whole game myself, and have done most of the writing. While friends have helped out over the years, this has always been a solo project. And yes, I’m <a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/programming/building-a-tech-stack-for-my-visual-novel/">building my own engine</a>.</p>



<p>The state of the game in early December last year was that the character management sim had been (mostly) implemented already, but the visual novel had not received a lot of love and the card game was just an idea; it hadn’t been designed at all.</p>



<p>So now that I had some time between work assignments, I wanted to see how much I could get done on my game if I fully committed to it. Would I be able to implement the core loop of my game and finally get something playable?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this three-part series, I will explain some of the strategies I employed during this period and how effective they were for my productivity.</p>







<p>This experiment did not form in a vacuum. I had recently read the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time</a> and I felt highly inspired to try it out. What makes this book so great is that it isn’t about applying One Neat Trick that will instantly fix your entire life but instead asks you to pick a few things that suit your style of working from a list of 80 different tactics.</p>

<p>There were a number of tips that I implemented immediately, but I also wanted to try out a few ideas of my own. Specifically, I wanted to see how far I could get by working very intensely on my game, but for only four hours a day.</p>



<p>I wanted to do all of my work between 8 AM and noon, have lunch, and then do something else for the rest of the day. The idea being that I could get a lot done on my game while also having more time for other activities that bring me joy, like lazily watching my shows on the couch.</p>



<p>I’m happy to report that this experiment was a resounding success. I was able to make <em>incredible </em>progress on my game while also streaming a season and a half of the brilliant superhero drama <em>The Boys</em>.</p>



<p>So how did I do all that?</p>







<p>One of the recommendations from <em>Make Time</em> is to turn off all notifications on your phone and other devices except those that you explicitly <em>want</em> to be interrupted by. The default on your phone is to interrupt you whenever, it’s high time to challenge that notion!</p>



<p>I decided to turn off all notifications except Google Calendar (meetings), LoseIt (diet tracking reminders), and WhatsApp (family &amp; friends). I also explicitly logged out of Twitter in the morning, which added some friction to wasting time on that website.</p>



<p>Next, I wanted to meticulously plan my mornings. I’m a morning person and get up at 6 AM every day, but I’m not always spending that time wisely. I decided to map out the two hours between 6 AM and 8 AM to an exact schedule:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>I’m able to do this is that I don’t have any children, I no longer have a commute, and my wife likes to sleep in until at least 8:30 AM. I’m therefore able to perfectly control my schedule in the morning, which definitely makes me an outlier. So don’t feel bad if you cannot apply this type of schedule to your own mornings!</p>



<p>My morning routine acknowledges my Twitter addiction, but I also explicitly block out time for planning my day. This does not always work out <em>perfectly</em>, but it does give me a much better chance of having a productive day.</p>







<p>Even though I no longer had any teammates to interrupt me, I still blocked out the time between 8 AM and noon in my calendar every day for doing focused work. This ensured that I would be in the right headspace and allow me to focus on getting stuff done. I would clear the notification from my phone when I started working, which helped me to get in the groove.</p>



<p>I stuck to this schedule for six weeks while waiting for my new job to begin. And the main thing I found is that I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits. It turns out that a lot of time at work is usually <a href="https://nesslabs.com/illusion-of-productivity">spent on busywork</a>! When I’m stuck on a problem at work, I tend to distract myself with e-mails or checking Twitter. But when your workday is only four hours, you really can’t afford to do that!</p>



<p>That’s why adding a bit of friction to Twitter was really useful. When I got stuck on a problem in one area, I would instead switch contexts to another area of my game. For example, I would work on the UI design when I was stuck on a coding problem and work on making temp art when I couldn’t figure out the game design.</p>



<p>Because I have ADHD, I find it very easy to slip into what the ADHD community calls “hyperfocus”. This is a mental state in which the whole world fades away and nothing becomes more important than the work in front of you. Getting into hyperfocus is in fact so easy for me to do that my main issue has always been getting <em>out</em> of this mental state. Setting a strict deadline helps with that: I can use my hyperfocus to get a lot done and I stop working when it’s time for lunch.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I did not always follow my own advice. There were definitely days that I worked beyond my four-hour limit. And I just want to put it in writing: <em>every time I did that was a mistake</em>. I did not get more done and instead just made myself jittery and anxious for no good reason. Hyperfocus is an extremely tiring mental state, it’s not possible to sustain it for more than a few hours without a serious crash the next day.</p>







<p>Working four hours a day for six week gave me 120 hours of time devoted to my game, or three full-time weeks. But I feel I got more done than that would imply. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Some of my accomplishments:</p>



<ul><li>All major gameplay systems implemented!</li><li>Implemented card game prototype in the actual game</li><li>Closed the gameplay loop from placement to night gameplay and back again</li><li>Created new temp art for 2 / 3 characters</li><li>Added code generation for widgets, screens, and Sass files</li><li>Converted most CSS to use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/">ABEM</a> naming scheme</li><li>Fixed not being able to use <a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/">GifCam</a> to capture footage</li><li>Added base widget class that renders itself when internal state changes (future blog post material!)</li><li>Converted all widgets and screens in the game to use new base class</li><li>Added localization system and used it for all new screens in the game</li><li>Perfected nightly build system using <a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">buildout</a></li><li>Added animations to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1349311128468398083">night gameplay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1352583568262914049">task outcome</a> screens</li></ul>







<p>It’s clear to me that I can get a lot done if I focus on reducing distractions and focus my efforts where it matters. Now that I’m gainfully employed again, I don’t think it will be acceptable for me to tell my boss that I would like to do all of my work in four hours yet get paid for eight. But I will definitely carry some of the learnings from this experiment with me.</p>



<p>What I intend to do now is roughly divide my workday in two: mornings are for <strong>focused </strong>work like coding and solving technical problems, while afternoons are for <strong>collaborative </strong>work like writing documentation and doing code reviews. But since I’ll be working from home in the foreseeable future, I will definitely be sticking to my morning routine!</p>



<p>In the next parts of this series, I will discuss how I figure out my task priorities and how I used public accountability to keep myself motivated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>We are proud to announce the launch of Library Futures Institute, a 501c3 organization fighting for the technology-positive future of libraries.</p>
              <p>The Board chose the name “Library Futures” understanding that our organization will work to ensure a sustainable future for libraries in the modern digital environment where our users live, work, and learn.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Our libraries and their promise of uplift and transformation are facing a threat to their continued existence. As our society moves into an increasingly digital landscape, libraries have built significant collections that have become inaccessible, unaffordable, or worse, subject to limitations striking at the very ability for a library to loan books to patrons. The significant legal and financial value of a collection, and the library's role in providing continual access to the collection, has been diminished by restrictive licensing, unscrupulous pricing, or an outright refusal to sell works to libraries. These policies directly impact the library's right to lend, copy, and preserve materials for the future.</p>
              <p>Without access to digital resources and digital books, libraries will not be able to continue to meet the needs of patrons. Libraries already struggle to provide access to digital resources. Market shifts have resulted in a handful of publishing entities who use highly restrictive licenses designed to lock down information rather than facilitate access to it. The true impact of these policies has become terribly clear during the pandemic as users have been cut off from access to collections.</p>
              <p>Library Futures will safeguard our libraries' right to provide free and open access to information to all citizens, a critical aspect of democratic process. Crucially, guiding the public in an increasingly complicated information landscape is a primary mechanism through which libraries can support the public good. Scholars like Joan Donovan assert that “hiring 10,000 librarians'' will fix our media landscape – those librarians will need access to high-quality, reasonably priced, and well-preserved materials. The future of our culture and knowledge depends on this.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We are dedicated to ensuring that libraries will continue to provide open, non-discriminatory access to information to benefit the general learning, research, and intellectual enrichment of the public.</p>
              <p>The work of the Library Futures Institute will also advance a research and programmatic agenda that strengthens the rights of libraries,&nbsp; including working toward ownership of digital works through the adoption of less restrictive licensing agreements for e-media and e-books. New licenses should allow libraries to own digital works with the same associated rights as print materials. This change would empower, not challenge, the library’s mission to promote access to knowledge, culture, and literature.</p>
              <p>The people who are involved with the Library Futures Institute – our Board, our Executive Director, our volunteers, our donors, and our future partners (like you!) - are keenly aware of the inequity in access to information. Immigrant communities, low-income families, and people living without internet access have the most at stake in this fight. Our communities do not have the resources to pay top-dollar for access to digital books at a premium, and will be unable to access the information and resources they need for school, work, and general learning.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>That awareness infuses every aspect of our work, from our future Catalyst Fund, to library-focused programming, and our support for digital lending.</p>
              <p>We are excited to launch today and partner with libraries, academic institutions, foundations, consortia, non-profits, and others, to enhance Library Futures’ mission.</p>
              <p>And Library Futures will work for all libraries - public, private, school, media, digital – to uphold our mission and values.</p>
              <p>We believe in the promise of libraries. We believe that access to information can uplift and edify society. We are also committed to preserving works for future generations. And we believe technology, used appropriately, can play an important part in saving a library mission and values.</p>
              <p>Together, we can change the paradigm. Together, we are Library Futures.</p>
              <p><strong>Board of Library Futures Institute</strong></p>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Hi! Dan and Nathan here.</strong> Early in 2020, we launched the Everything Bundle, a Substack devoted to productivity and business strategy. We started with two newsletters, Superorganizers and Divinations, written and produced by just us. Almost twelve months later, we now have eight newsletters in the bundle, written by some of the smartest, most accomplished practitioners in tech and startups: Li Jin, Tiago Forte, Nat Eliason, Jerry Colonna, and Sherrell Dorsey.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The response has been far better than we ever anticipated: the Everything Bundle has been read by over 750,000 people, it has almost 2,400 paid subscribers, and has cracked the top 10 on Substackâ€™s paid newsletter leaderboard. To us, the signal is clear that there is value in a bundle like this. Readers want access to a place that consistently delivers business writing from a variety of perspectivesâ€”for one subscription price.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re proud of what weâ€™ve built so far, but we think itâ€™s just the start. Today we want to share where weâ€™re going, what we stand for, and why we exist. But first, a few announcements:</p>

        <h5>The Everything Bundle is now Every.</h5> 
        <p>We started by covering productivity and strategy, and our hope is to cover every industry and job role, every broad theme and niche interest. Weâ€™ve picked the name Every as one that reflects that scope.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™re structured as a writer collectiveâ€”a new model for a media company.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve been doing it for almost a year, and now weâ€™re ready to talk about it. A writer collective is a way to write thatâ€™s somewhere between starting a Substack and working for <em>The New York Times</em>. We give our writers financial upside in the work they do and the freedom to build their own creative vision, but we also support them with distribution to an audience, editorial support, and an advance on their subscription revenue if they need it. Weâ€™re excited to see ideas like this becoming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/media/brick-house-journalism-cooperative.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the <a href="https://www.axios.com/forbes-paid-newsletter-subscriptions-ab423ae1-0b90-4863-acad-40a373adce80.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">zeitgeist</a>: we believe it is the best structure to support diverse voices, uncover undercovered topics, and create quality writing that can help our readers think differently about business and solve real-world problems.</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve moved onto our own homegrown platform.</h5> 
        <p>Our business wouldnâ€™t exist without Substack, and we think the world of them, but weâ€™re excited to announce that Every will be run on a platform we built ourselves. Weâ€™re technology people. And as weâ€™ve grown, we keep coming up with ideas to make our product and business better. So we decided to build our own CMS, one that works differently from anything that already exists, and gives us the freedom to evolve it however we want as we seek new ways to meet the needs of our audience.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve raised a pre-seed round from Eric Stromberg at Bedrock and a group of ambitious angels.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve known Eric for many years, and because heâ€™s a former founder in the space and a&nbsp; current investor in The Athletic, Cameo, and Dipsea, we think heâ€™s the perfect person to help us build our vision.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re building Every because we believe there is someone in every industryâ€”from wealth management to waste managementâ€”whose eyes sparkle when they talk about their work. These people are ambitious, and they are curious. They think of business as a subject that is intellectually interesting, and as an activity that can be pursued not just for personal gain, but also as an expression of soul. They care deeply about what they do because they see how it connects to the lives of the people they serve: they can tell you how everything in the world depends on their job getting done.</p>

        <p>You have never heard of most of these people, but they are out there. We hope to find them and bring them to our readersâ€”by writing about them, and by writing with them. We believe by doing so, we can help build a better world: the stories told today become the businesses built tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Weâ€™ve dedicated ourselves to this mission because we believe great business writing is currently too rare. Weâ€™d love to walk you why we think itâ€™s rare, and how a writer collective can help make more of it.</p>

        <h2>Why is great business writing rare?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>There is more business writing on the internet than a single mind can fathom. Much of it is amazing, but as we all sadly know, thereâ€™s a lot that isâ€¦ not. Weâ€™re all burned and burdened by the glut of â€œthink pieces,â€� advertorials, and hastily composed posts that donâ€™t reach for nuance or complexity.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We think this happens for three primary reasons.</p>
        <h4>1 - Great business writing requires multiple skills</h4>
        <p>To write something great about business, you have to know something worth writing about, and you need to be able to write about it in a compelling way. Unfortunately, the number of people who can do both is vanishingly small.</p>
        
        <p>        
          <img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/static/rare-venn.jpg">
        </p>

        <p>Most of the people who know what theyâ€™re talking about donâ€™t write. Writing is hard, itâ€™s time consuming, and, honestly, itâ€™s agonizing. You canâ€™t take a magic pill and suddenly wake up as a compelling writerâ€”you just have to spend years and years doing it. Itâ€™s a craft.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On the other hand, there are many skilled writers who donâ€™t have enough business knowledge. Or they simply donâ€™t have the time to dive deeply enough into their subject to do it justice. Which brings us to our second point.</p>

        <h4>2 - Writers are pressured to publish too often</h4>
        <p>Great writing takes time. Yes, thereâ€™s the time it takes to write and edit. But it also takes time to experience things worth writing about, to reflect, and to learn. Thereâ€™s no shortcut or trick that can solve this constraint. Thatâ€™s why the best writing, often found in books and magazines, develops over months, if not years.</p>

        <p>Of course that timescale is rare on the internet. Writers who work for ad-supported digital publications often need to produce daily, if not multiple times a day. Solo paid newsletters need to publish at least weekly, if not 2-3 times a week. Weâ€™ve done this ourselves, and some of our favorite writers do it with a level of quality and consistency that boggles the mindâ€”but itâ€™s grueling. You get burned out. We did.</p>

        <p>When youâ€™re burned out, you forget what inspired you to start writing in the first place. You scroll through Twitter â€œlooking for ideasâ€� and contemplate a career change to carpentry, until, defeated, you curl into a nap. You realize that your sense of curiosity, rather than driving your work, is currently in hidingâ€”which brings us to our third point.</p>

        <h4>3 - Most writing is chasing clout, rather than insight</h4>
        <p>Every writer wants clout. But when you prioritize clout over curiosity, the work suffers. You try to play up popular narratives. You worry about keeping up.&nbsp; You look at what everyone else is writing about, and you try to write the same thingâ€”but better. You opine on every trending topicâ€”even when you donâ€™t have anything new to add to the conversation. You say dumb things to get attention. (Okay, to be fair, we have <a href="https://every.to/divinations/quibi-will-be-a-multi-billion-dollar-355585" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">done that</a> ourselves, but at least hopefully in an interesting way ðŸ™ˆ.)</p>

        <p>This strategy can attract attention, but it leaves readers unsatisfied, and doesnâ€™t age well. Itâ€™s like blowing counterclockwise into a hurricane and claiming credit when it reaches a Category 5. Aiming directly for clout is all about profiting from trends, rather than creating them. Itâ€™s about answering questions that have already been asked, not about asking new questions.</p>

        <p>When you put all of these forces togetherâ€”an arena that requires multiple skills to succeed, the incessant pressure to publish, and the human tendency to chase cloutâ€”you end up with a lot of writing thatâ€™s kind of like cotton candy. It tastes good at first, but it gives you a stomachache after a while. Worse, it creates a narrative ecosystem that rewards folks who already have money and an audience, rather than reflecting the best of what our community knowsâ€”and wants to knowâ€”about the world.</p>

        <p>So, what to do? Write together, rather than alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>How writing together solves these problems</h2>
        <p>Writing together isnâ€™t trending right now, but itâ€™s actually pretty great.&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t need one person to have both business knowledge and writing talent. You can find one person who has business knowledge and another person who has writing skill, and then create systems that support them writing together. Now youâ€™ve unlocked both business experience and writing talent in a way that wasnâ€™t possible before.</li>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t have to publish so often that you risk burning out. Instead, the group can share the load. That means each writer has time to produce higher quality work, but readers still get content on a consistent schedule.</li>
  
         <li>And finally, when you write together, you can form a culture that pushes you to write from a genuine sense of curiosity, expertise, and interest, rather than clout-chasing. You can hold each other accountable to this when you veer away from it, and you can encourage each other to pursue the fragile little sparks of inspiration that turn into the best pieces.

    <section>
      <p>I’ve long felt the same way about personal computers that Matt Crawford feels about cars: &nbsp;it is important to build your own PC so that you can have more control over a technology that you use every day.</p><p>I have been building my own PCs since the mid-1990s, when I put together my first machine using a NexGen Intel-clone processor. &nbsp;Since then I have not bought a whole PC; when I want better performance, I simply add more memory, put in new hard disks, upgrade the graphics card, or swap out the motherboard and CPU.</p><p>Windows-based computers are not hard to build. &nbsp;You just buy the parts—motherboard, CPU, memory, disk storage, a case, monitor and graphics card, and plug them together. &nbsp;There are a number of little tricks you learn along the way, like properly seating the cooling fan on top of the microprocessor, or inserting the memory sticks into their sockets the right way. &nbsp;But PCs are highly modular and standardized, and the standards don’t shift that often—from SCSI connectors to SATA, or from DDR3 to DDR4, or DVI to DisplayPort to connect the monitor. &nbsp;You just need to keep straight what the current standards are, and buy accordingly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1000w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 2016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Getting ready for a build</figcaption></figure><p>Building your own machine has quite a number of advantages. &nbsp;You can customize them to exactly the uses you intend. Not everyone is a gamer who requires a humongous 16GB graphics card. &nbsp;You can get away with a rather modest machine if you’re just trying to create a home entertainment system. &nbsp;You can put your computer in a nice case that will fit easily on your desk. Recently I’ve taken to using a $50 Raspberry Pi-based computer to read the newspaper in the morning. &nbsp;In recent years AMD has pulled ahead of Intel in the CPU wars; why not shift over to their chips? &nbsp;Maintenance is much easier: computers, like human beings, seldom fail as complete systems; rather, an individual component goes on the fritz and needs to be replaced. &nbsp;Because something has failed on your motherboard does not mean you need to replace your keyboard, mouse, and monitor. &nbsp;If you have built your own machine, you can usually diagnose a problem down the road. &nbsp;For example, if you don’t hear the little “beep” when you turn it on, you know the machine has failed to post and that there’s something wrong with your BIOS. On the other hand, if it posts but hangs up when loading Windows, you suspect your copy of the operating system has been corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.</p><p>From the standpoint of someone who wants to maximize their technological autonomy, Apple computers are an absolute nightmare. &nbsp;Although I still own an Apple laptop, I seldom use it and definitely do not love my iPhone. &nbsp;Apple products were deliberately designed to prevent their users from modifying them, down to the use of proprietary fasteners that require special Apple-only tools. &nbsp;I tried to get into an old Mac laptop with my sons a few years ago; we ended up with a lot of useless bent metal trying to force our way in. &nbsp;Apple does not want you to be able to fix your own computer—rather, it wants you to visit the “Genius Bar” at the Apple Store and look over all the new products while you wait for someone to fix your machine in the back room. &nbsp;The “genius” refers not to you, the helpless customer, but to the marketing guy who thought up this system.</p><p>Apple is constantly making its users adopt proprietary connectors that you are forced to buy from them. &nbsp;An example is the “lightning” connector that was first introduced on the iPhone 7 and replaced the old 3.5mm headphone jack. &nbsp;Apple claims that this change was made to improve the user experience, but really they just want to force you to buy new headphones or adapters. &nbsp;They’ve similarly changed the plug on their power cords so often that you have to discard one from just a couple of years ago in favor of their most recent model. &nbsp;Landfills around the world are brimming with useless Apple power adapters.</p><p>Microsoft, as I well remember, tried to get away with something like this in the 1990s. &nbsp;The programming language Java had been created as a common, open standard that would operate across a variety of platforms—Macs, PCs, Linux, and so on. &nbsp;Microsoft then tried to “fork” the language and create a version that would only run on its own machines, which it could do because so many people used Windows PCs. &nbsp;This became part of the Justice Department’s decade-long antitrust suit against Microsoft, which in the end forced the latter to stand down.</p><p>You can only get away with this sort of behavior if you hold a near-monopolistic position in the marketplace, and the huge scale of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon has become a major challenge for our democracy. Unfortunately, after the Microsoft case, the U.S. stopped trying to enforce antitrust laws against Big Tech. This is a pattern that has only recently been reversed.</p><p>So learning to build your own computer reduces your acquisition costs, keeps down operating expenses, means that you can fix your machine when it breaks down on a weekend, and otherwise gives you the satisfaction of knowing exactly what’s under the hood of your computer. &nbsp;You’ve clawed back a little bit of personal autonomy.</p>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The decision of whether to use a monorepo or a polyrepo structure for your source code can be a very emotional (maybe even religious!) battle. On its surface, it's not much different than "tabs vs spaces" or "vim vs emacs". Or is it?</p>
<p>In the following, I will attempt to draw objective, logical arguments for both approaches and also throw in a very popular third option: the hybrid.</p>
<h2 id="quickintro">Quick intro</h2>
<p>The <strong>monorepo layout</strong> consists of a single code repository where multiple projects coexist in a hierarchical directory structure. For example:</p>
<pre><code>├── lib
|   ├── lib
|   └── lib
├── lib
├── lib
├── lib
├── app
|   ├── lib
|   └── lib
|       ├── lib
|       └── lib
├── app
|   └── lib
└── big-project
|   ├── lib
|   ├── app
|   |   ├── lib
|   |   └── lib
|   └── app
|       └── lib
└── big-project
    ├── lib
    ├── lib
    ├── app
    |   └── lib
    └── app
        ├── lib
        └── lib
</code></pre>
<p>Each <code>lib</code> and each <code>app</code> would contain various other sub-directories to house the source code itself, depending on the language it is written in. You get the idea.</p>
<p>In <strong>polyrepo layout</strong> (sometimes also called <strong>multirepo layout</strong>), on the other hand, the code is spread across... well multiple repositories. The degree to which the separation between logical pieces of code can vary from language to language and from style to style. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here's an example possible structure.</p>
<pre><code>github.com/myorg/app1
├── docs
├── examples
├── src
└── tests

github.com/myorg/app2
├── docs
└── src

github.com/myorg/app3
├── lib
|   └── src
├── lib
|   └── src
└── lib
    └── src

github.com/myorg/lib1
└── src
</code></pre>
<p>Each repository is focused on specific functionality. The structure of the repository is usually heavily influenced by the best practices of the language they host.</p>
<p>A third alternative that some people use is the <strong>hybrid repository layout</strong>, whereby some components coexist in one or more monorepos, while others are separated in their own isolated, smaller repositories. Deciding which component goes where may be influenced by team ownership, the language of the code, whether the component is open or closed source, and other factors.</p>
<h2 id="judgingcriteria">Judging criteria</h2>
<p>The structure of your source code empowers or impedes various engineering processes. It is the lifeblood of your technical product and it needs to account for all the possible ways it can be used. To avoid boiling the ocean with this article, however, we will focus on the most popular use-cases and characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of importing</li>
<li>Ease of contributing within and across projects</li>
<li>Viewing diffs</li>
<li>Structure of releases</li>
<li>Builds and CI</li>
<li>Open vs closed source</li>
<li>Issue tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, we will make certain assumptions about the underlying technologies used: for example, we will assume that you are using GitHub for the repositories and the issue tracking. The considerations typically apply to most other setups that do not necessarily use these technologies. They work similarly.</p>
<h2 id="letstakealook">Let's take a look</h2>
<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>
<!-- ![Containers seen from above](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Shipping containers seen from above"></p><p>You can't talk about the code layout, without looking primarily at how code can be imported and reused. Different languages can vary wildly in the way code can be imported.</p>
<p>For example, in Go, you have the freedom to reference just about any package (directory) in any repository with ease. There are mechanisms to automatically download any remote code and use it, via the new <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">modules features</a>. For Go, it is just as easy to use monorepos or polyrepos for code imports.</p>
<p>In Java, on the other hand, you cannot simply import a GitHub repository - you have to first publish a JAR to an artifactory, and then reference that JAR in your Java-specific build file. So it becomes far easier to reference a package in the same repository than across repositories setup-wise. But the code can become unwieldy. For this reason, some Java monorepo layouts tend to stick with segmenting the code across separate modules, each possibly producing separate artifacts. See for example <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html">multi-module Maven builds</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript tends to be spread across multiple repositories typically. To use a package from one repository to another, however, the package needs to be published to NPM. It's less popular to use a monorepo layout with JavaScript, however, if you would like to experiment, there are a number of tools to help out with the directory organization, such that each project gets its own separate <code>package.json</code>. <a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna">Lerna</a> is one such tool.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: It depends heavily on the language. Even if the language requires an artifactory or a package repository in the middle when referencing code across repositories, it still seems like polyrepos are more popular. When using a monorepo layout, it's often preferable to create distinct modules of each project and some communities have developed tools to help with that.</p>
<h3 id="contributionswithinthesameproject">Contributions within the same project</h3>
<!-- ![Software engineers collaborating](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Software engineers collaborating"></p><p>Making changes to source code can be isolated to one specific area, or it can span multiple functional concerns and thus need to cross-project boundaries. The developer experience may vary depending on how the code is laid out.</p>
<p>When viewing changes to a single project, it is easier to visualize the history of changes in GitHub in a polyrepo setup, by simply navigating the list of pull requests. In a monorepo setup, however, all the pull requests are mixed together; your best bet, in that case, is to first open the specific sub-directory you are interested in and then clicking the <strong>History</strong> link. If you have squash merges enabled, you can easily navigate the PR from the commit message.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/history.png" alt="history"></p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions within the same project is easier with a polyrepo layout, as it is easier to track the history of changes per-repository rather than per-directory.</p>
<h3 id="contributionsacrossprojects">Contributions across projects</h3>
<!-- ![Whiteboard collaboration](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg" alt="Whiteboard collaboration"></p><p>When making contributions across multiple projects, there is a significant distinction. Arguably, this is one of the main reasons to use the monorepo layout. When everything is in a single repository, many cross-cutting concerns can be modified and submitted as a single, atomic PR. For example, you could write code for a new feature and make adjustments end-to-end: UI, backend, API, DB schema migration, documentation, etc. The simplicity of the dev-test and contribution process really shines in monorepos, when done right <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Atomic PRs also help to visualize changes for review. It is easier to see a feature take shape when the changes across projects are visible in one place.</p>
<p>In polyrepos, cross-cutting changes need to be performed as separate distinct PRs. Although it is more work to open separate PRs, it's sometimes useful to create the mindfulness that the components are landing asynchronously in production (for example, if these are separate microservices talking to each other).</p>
<p>One of the challenging aspects of contributing across multiple repositories is that the dependencies are often referenced as a pinned version number. If you change project B on the <code>main</code> branch and it is referenced by project A as <code>v1.2.3</code>, then you will need to work out a way to test project A with the latest of project B for development, or, as a workaround, perform a release of project B and update project A to now point to <code>v1.2.4</code>. This creates possible significant hurdles for the developer to go through and for this reason, developers get discouraged to contribute to other team's codebases unless they really have to.</p>
<p>Another possible side-effect of dependency version pinning is what I call <em>delayed integration breaking</em>: the <code>main</code> branch of project B no longer works with project A due to some change performed in the past. Project A has been pointing to <code>v1.2.3</code> for a long time, while project B has been evolving independently. The first time this is discovered is when a developer attempts to make a change to B, which is needed in A. This, again, contributes to the hurdles developers face when contributing across repositories and creates hidden technical debt.</p>
<p>Dependency version pinning is not a bad thing in and of itself. If the two projects are well separated and the team maintaining the dependency is aware of maintaining compatibility (and enforces this with proper testing), then this is often preferred. After all, the way we typically consume open-source software relies on this model and it is very successful. However, if two projects need to evolve together tightly, then a possible alternative might be always referencing the <code>main</code> branch version (in Java, this is known as the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_snapshots.htm"><code>SNAPSHOT</code> version</a>) as the dependency and thus being able to catch integration regressions much more quickly. During a release, all <code>SNAPSHOT</code> references would need to be updated to pinned versions, however.</p>
<p>Another option might be to use a bot that regularly updates dependencies. The support for such a bot may be language-specific, however. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/tenable/Kastle/pull/165">example of Scala Steward in action</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, in polyrepo setups developers have the option to use staggered dependency upgrades: the ability to update a dependency gradually across other projects and thus control the way a change is rolled out. In a monorepo setup, this would be achieved through other means, such as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">feature flagging</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions across projects is usually easier in a monorepo layout, as PRs can make changes across several components at the same time and there is no need to constantly update the referenced version of dependencies. In addition, integration breakages are obvious immediately.</p>

<figcaption>Compilers are the New Frameworks</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike React, Vue or Angular, that do the bulk of their work in the browser at runtime. Svelte is a compile time framework.</p><blockquote>A framework should be thing, that runs in your build step.</blockquote><p>It shifts that work into a compile step, taking our high level declarative components and turning them into efficient, imperative, low level code to manipulate the DOM directly.</p><p>All these results in a framework free vanilla js code at runtime.</p><p>The implications are:</p><ul><li>Faster initial load.</li><li>Faster payload delivery due to small size.</li><li>Unnecessary updates never happen. (Which you get to see when you put a breakpoint in a React app!)</li><li>Less performance hits on run time as all optimizations gets performed in compile time.</li><li>Unused CSS gets removed in the build step.</li><li>It even points out missing attributes, that are necessary.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>When doing image processing, rendering or converting between RGB color spaces, it is easy to end up with RGB values outside of the 0.0 to 1.0 range (or 0 to 255 for 8-bit colors). This normally means that it isn’t possible to encode the color and it needs to be adjusted somehow before being displayed or encoded (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScRGB">scRGB</a> is an example of an exception, and has a different range). The range of supported colors in a color spaces is referred to as a its <em>gamut</em>.</p><p>Many of the colors outside the gamut are still valid colors, they just can’t be encoded in the given color space. The colors that can’t be encoded can be categorized as follows (for RGB color spaces without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Imaginary_colors">imaginary primaries</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>One or more RGB values are larger than one, but none are negative</strong><br>These colors are too bright for the color space, but could be encoded at a lower luminance.</li><li><strong>One or more negative values</strong><br>These color are more colorful than the color space is able to encode. Some of these can be real colors, but they can also be colors more colorful than physically possible. This is a consequence of linear encoding of colors, which is able to encode colors that can’t exist in real life.</li></ul><p>The simplest technique for dealing with colors outside the valid range is to simply clamp <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> individually. The simplicity of this makes the technique widespread, but unfortunately it has significant drawbacks and can lead to unpleasant color distortions.</p><p>Here is an example of taking a photo and increasing its exposure and colorfulness significantly, with results displayed as sRGB. Colorfulness has been increased by scaling <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> chroma. RGB values here are simply clamped to the 0.0 to 1.0 range.</p><br><div><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg"><img alt="Original" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Unprocessed</em></p><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg"><img alt="Processed" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Processed with out of range values clamped</em></p></div><p>This is of course problematic. Hues are heavily distorted and all the details in the flowers are gone. Better methods are needed. Thankfully, this problem isn’t new and has been researched a lot over the years.</p><p>Two main research topics exist:</p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping">Tone mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping high dynamic range images to a lower dynamic range. This typically involves altering both colors inside and outside the gamut and sometimes involves different kinds of spatial filtering to keep details while reducing overall dynamic range.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Gamut_mapping">Gamut mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping colors from one color space to another and dealing with the mismatch in what colors can be encoded. This can either be done using <em>gamut compression</em> or <em>gamut expansion</em>, which adjusts all colors of an image, or using <em>gamut clipping</em>, which leaves colors that exist in both color spaces intact, while mapping colors outside the gamut back in range. For an overview see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">“The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey”</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Tone mapping, gamut expansion and gamut compression are all useful techniques, but will not be the focus of this article. Instead we will limit the scope to creating a practical alternative to clipping sRGB values, by looking at gamut clipping in the sRGB color space and on relatively simple, robust and portable algorithms. The source code for the operations shown is also available, at the <a href="#source-code">end of the article</a>.</p><p>The techniques investigated are also, with some additional work, applicable to other color spaces, and some of the building blocks can be for other things, such as gamut compression. Combining gamut clipping with tone mapping can also be useful since some tone mapping techniques may still produce colors outside the target gamut.</p><h2 id="gamut-clipping">Gamut Clipping <a href="#gamut-clipping"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h2><p>The goal of gamut clipping is to take colors that are outside the target gamut, and map them back to valid colors in a way that avoids perceived distortion and artifacts. In this article we also want to do this in a way that is reasonably efficient and simple to implement. Many techniques require complex iterative algorithms per pixel (or storing the results in 3D lookup tables) – those will not be considered here, but can be useful for many applications.</p><p>Instead we will take this commonly used approach:</p><ul><li>Work in a perceptual color space.</li><li>Keep hue constant, only change lightness and chroma.</li><li>Only project color along straight lines in the perceptual color space.</li></ul><p>For an overview of different approaches, see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey</a>.</p><p>As a color space, we will use the <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> perceptual color space, since it models hue, chroma and lightness well while being easy to work with mathematically. In particular, with Oklab, the shape of the gamut of an RGB color space is described by cubic polynomials, which are quite practical to work with compared to the equations you get with other spaces.</p><p>Since we have decided to keep hue constant, it is now possible to plot the problem in two dimensions, using lightness, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and chroma, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To better understand the shape of the sRGB gamut, let’s look at of slices of constant hue. These are sampled every 30 degrees:</p><br><p>Our goal is to find a way to map colors outside the gamut, shown in grey in the graphs, back into the gamut using straight lines.

If the intersection is with the lower edge, this is everything we need to do. If the intersection is with the upper half, the triangle is only an approximation and we need to refine the solution. Again, one step of Halley’s method is enough to do this with high accuracy.</p><p>Altogether, this is everything needed to find the intersection between a line and the sRGB gamut. To derive the numerical approximation of the location of the cusp, this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JdXHhEyjjEE--19ZPH1bZV_LiGQBndzs?usp=sharing">Google Colab Notebook</a> was used. With same method is should be possible derive approximations for other RGB color spaces.

choice of projection will always be a matter of preference. Overall I think preserving lightness does the best overall of the above methods (and others agree, it is a commonly used technique). One challenge with preserving lightness though is that all colors with <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L&gt;1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L&lt;0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> get projected to a single point, and that highly saturated colors can become almost completely desaturated if light or dark enough, even though sacrificing just a small amount of lightness would have resulted in a much closer match.</p><p>For this reason I’ve looked into creating new methods that mostly preserve lightness, but behaves closer to the single point projection methods for high and low lightness colors. The result is two new methods. They are novel as far as I am aware, but there are a lot of gamut mapping papers I haven’t read.</p><p>The first method is based on projection towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>5</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=0.5, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and the second based on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=L_{cusp}, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_045"><div><p>As our application scales to multiple users, we need to start thinking about scaling our servers and applications with it. Load balancing is the activity of effectively distributing traffic load across multiple servers.</p><p>This is how we achieve highly available applications that help us achieve scaling effectively.</p><h2>What is load-balancing?</h2><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Since nobody can afford a web server overload, we scale out our backend servers to multiple machines. The aim is to have a distributed architecture and to avoid having all users connecting to a single server and choke it up. Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page
            </p>
            <p><b>21M</b> resource URLs requested
            </p>
            <p><b>383K</b> errors logged
            </p>
            <p><b>88M</b> global variables logged
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.003%)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for linked resources</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.0001%)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (8.6%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For linked resources, HTTP 3 is about 100x more prevalent. How can this be true? Because all the sites are linking the same stuff:</p>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>

            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.

        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

<p><small>21 Jan 2021 — 8 min read</small></p>
</header>
<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>
<center>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent around 5 hours to write the content, and lost the same amount of time looking for a publishing software or Saas to generate beautiful PDF for developer-oriented content, with source code.

</center>
<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic
formatting options I needed: titles, italic, source code… And the source code
was highlighted!</p>
<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use
<a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which I already used for my VSCode. So I
created
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-dracula-theme">a custom theme</a>
for it. 🙂</p>

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good at generating HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using
<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>, which could have been a perfect
solution.</p>

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first
purpose, but I find it easier to use than Gimp or commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that
matters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>
(without video) from the book’s content…</p>
<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.
And since Markdown is text, it’s easy to keep track of the history using Git. 🙂</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

		<p>I've already described the differences between <a href="https://blog.luap.info/why-most-saas-companies-cant-be-successful-with-both-enterprise-and-smb-customers.html">Saas B2B SMB and Saas B2B Enterprise</a>. But to summarize, B2B Enterprise is when you customers buy you for your vision and your solutions and B2B SMB is when people buy you for your features. As a result B2B Enterprise is also usually when your customers are big companies (more than 250 employees).</p>
<h2>Nobody cares about the product in Enterprise</h2>
<p>Because the only people who care about the product are not the people who buy or sell your product. This can be simplified as : No important person cares about your product. I'm not even sure that the product quality of a B2B Saas company has any influence on the company's business success.</p>
<p>Let's first define a good product, a product of good quality. A good prodct is a product users are happy to use, it is heavily influenced by UI, UX and simplicity of doing common actions. If you want to understand if your product is good, talk to a new user, and ask him a feedback of your product, if he tells mostly things to improve, you have a bad product ! If most of your users are think the same, you have a bad product.</p>
<p>Let's look at the product quality of big Saas Enterprise products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Salesforce a good CRM  ?</li>
<li>Is SAP a good ERP ?</li>
<li>Is Team a good communication system ?</li>
<li>Is any Oracle product a good product ?</li>
<li>What about Workday, Atlassian, MongoDB, Alteryx ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people who use those tools will tell you that the products are shit, while still being more or less satisfied with the overall functionalities it offers them.</p>
<p>Of course not all products are like that, Zoom comes to my mind as a good product in the Saas b2b enterprise space. But if you look at the 50 most successful business Saas b2b enterprise software in the world, most of them will have a shitty product. There are several explanations of why it is like that:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the bigger and the older a company is the worse the product is going to become, so of course the biggest companies have the shittiest product</li>
<li>Second, people who buy the product, are not the ones who are using it, as a result product quality is never something they care</li>
<li>Third, A good product is beneficial for referrals or inbound marketing, but most of B2B enterprise companies get their customers through outbound marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>Should that change ? I don't think so. At the end of the day if you are obsessed about product quality you should not try to work in B2B enterprise. Working time is limited and the more you work on the product quality the less you work on other more important topics.</p>
<h2>How to be a successful product manager in Saas B2B Enterprise</h2>
<p>Most PM, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507">Inspired</a>, like the book and would like to work inside their Product organization the same way it is described in the book. But the book, and most product management articles you can read online, are focusing on creating great products, or products that customers love. But one thing you need to always have in mind when you are working for a business, is that the business is paying you because your work is going to bring them money. And in the case of Saas Enterprise, making great products is not what is going to bring money to your company.</p>
<p>The result of that mindset is that you will see very often inside Saas B2B companies. Customer support, customer management and product management clashing with Sales and the execs about how the product is not what the end users want. There is this perpetual stupid loop of sales and execs saying, we dont care about those things because that is not what customers wants and the end users focused teams saying, but this is what end users are telling us on a daily basis. Both of those teams are right, they just don't talk about the same people.</p>
<p>If at heart, being a product manager is creating products that customers love, then product management in Saas Enterprise is closer to <em>creating products which support the sales and customer team</em></p>
<p>If you look at your job from that angle, a lot of things change:</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on your users only, you need to focus on two kinds of groups, users and your sales colleagues. Most of the PM toolkits still apply when listening to users. But to listen to sales people things are different. You need to small talk with them, you need to go into sales meetings, you need to understand the sales cycle, you need to understand the value proposition of your company, you need to be in contact with sales guys.</p>
<p>First challenge : Every salesperson in the company is going to push you to build features that their prospects want. The sales team is not really a team, every member has its own objectives, and a small part of their salary comes from team objectives. So they are willing to 'fight' with each other to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>Second challenge: Sales people have no idea of what features their customers want. First because the customers themselves don't know what they want. Second, salespeople are trained to sell some kinds of products, and are not really good at guessing new ideas and finding what is important or not. They will most of the time repeat what a customer is saying, without even trying to understand what that means or if the customer really needs it.</p>
<p>Third challenge: There is a ton of politics in sales. Execs directly step in into the sales cycle, promising things to customers. Some prospects are 'strategic', some prospects are more important than others ...</p>
<p>So if I can give you a few advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be friend with sales people, you are going to tell them 'No' a lot of time (if not all of the time), but their feedbacks is important, so try to be as much friend with them as possible</li>
<li>Be friends with sales execs, involve them in your decisions, make them participate. They are not going to decide, but they will like being consulted, and will help you maintain a good relationships with them</li>
<li>Stop complaining that your product is not the best for your users. Your customers are not your users, treat them well but keep in mind they are not the only ones you need to care about</li>
<li>Always balance your decisions between what is great for your users and what is great for your sales colleagues. Are we spending enough time on things that help the business VS spending time on making users love the product ?</li>
<li>Keep fighting to improve the product because at some point a too bad product is going to be very bad for your company. But don't make product quality the most important decision in your prioritization and day to day decisions</li>
<li>Don't let the execs or salespeople or your manager make the decisions for you. Always stay in control. As soon as the execs are able to impose you their decisions, you lose all credibility as a product manager and you won't protect your developers, neither your users and it's going to be bad. You need to be able to say 'No' to your CEO, and you need to be able to tell him 'No' every day!</li>
<li>Forget what you have read in Inspired, almost none of it will help you be good in Saas Enterprise. Always search what impact this new thing is going to have in the overall product. Don't promise anything. Either say 'No' or say 'Yes' but don't do it afterwards. As a result it is also much more complex to evaluate a PM in that type of company.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have any idea on how bad a product needs to be to really harm your business. It is almost as if the worst products make the best businesses.</p>
<p>This post can look a bit negative but don't interpret that as a critic. Some PM will prefer working with AB Tests and KPIs and others will like of the environement of Saas Enterprise, I personally prefer the latter !</p>
<p>If you have any question, send me an email. </p>

A CrashLoopBackOff is possible for several  types of k8s misconfigurations (not able to connect to persistent volumes, init-container misconfiguration, etc). We aren’t going to cover how to configure k8s properly in this article, but instead will focus on the harder problem of debugging your code or, even worse, someone else’s code 😱</p><p>Here is the output from kubectl describe pod for a CrashLoopBackOff:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Name:           frontend-5c49b595fc-sjzkg</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>Namespace:      tedbf02-ac-david-nginx-golang-tmcclung-nginx-golang</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>Priority:       0</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>Start Time:     Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:55:49 -0500</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Labels:         app=frontend</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>                pod-template-hash=5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>                tier=frontend</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>Status:         Running</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>IP:             10.1.31.0</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>IPs:            &lt;none&gt;</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Controlled By:  ReplicaSet/frontend-5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>Containers:</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  frontend:</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    Container ID:   docker://a4ed7efcaaa87fe36342cf7532ff1de5cd51b62d3d681dfb9857999300f6c587</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    Image:          .amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    Image ID:       docker-pullable://.amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    Port:           80/TCP</span></p><p><span>18</span><span>    Host Port:      0/TCP</span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>20</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>      Reason:       Error</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>      Exit Code:    1</span></p><p><span>24</span><span>      Started:      Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>25</span><span>      Finished:     Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>26</span><span>    Ready:          False</span></p><p><span>27</span><span>    Restart Count:  9043</span></p></pre></div><p>Two common problems when starting a container are OCI runtime create failed (which means you are referencing a binary or script that doesn’t exist on the container) and container “Completed” or “Error” which both mean that the code executing on the container failed to run a service and stay running.</p><p>Here’s an example of an OCI runtime error, trying to execute: “hello crashloop”:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Port:          80/TCP</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    Host Port:     0/TCP</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    Command:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      hello</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      crashloop</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      Reason:       ContainerCannotRun</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      Message:      OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:370: starting container process caused: exec: "hello": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      Exit Code:    127</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>      Started:      Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      Finished:     Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p></pre></div><p>K8s gives you the exit status of the process in the container when you look at a pod using kubectl or <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s" title="k9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">k9s</a>.

The Dockerfile schema is quite lenient and allows users to set <code>Cmd</code> without <code>Entrypoint</code>, which means that the first argument in <code>Cmd</code> will be the executable to run. </p><p>Note: k8s uses a different naming convention for Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code>.

In order to get the startup command when you’re dealing with someone else’s container, we need to know the intended Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> of the Docker image.

First, we pull the container locally using <code>docker pull</code>, then we inspect the container image to get the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code>:</p><ul><li><code>docker pull &lt;image id&gt;</code></li><li><code>docker inspect &lt;image id&gt;</code></li></ul><p>Here we use <code>jq</code> to filter the JSON response from <code>docker inspect</code>:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>david@sega:~: docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>7.10.2: Pulling from elasticsearch/elasticsearch</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>ddf49b9115d7: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>e736878e27ad: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>7487c9dcefbe: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>9ccb7e6e1f0c: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>dcec6dec98db: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>8a10b4854661: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>1e595aee1b7d: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>06cc198dbf22: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>55b9b1b50ed8: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>Digest: sha256:d528cec81720266974fdfe7a0f12fee928dc02e5a2c754b45b9a84c84695bfd9</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>Status: Downloaded newer image for docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>david@sega:~: docker inspect docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2 | jq '.[0] .ContainerConfig .Entrypoint'</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>[</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  "/tini",</span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  "--",</span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  "/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh"</span></p><p><span>20</span><span>]</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>david@sega:~: docker inspect docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2 | jq '.[0] .ContainerConfig .Cmd'</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>[</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  "/bin/sh",</span></p><p><span>24</span><span>  "-c",</span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  "#(nop) ",</span></p><p><span>26</span><span>  "CMD [\"eswrapper\"]"</span></p><p><span>27</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="the-dreaded-crashloopbackoff">The Dreaded CrashLoopBackOff</h2><p>Now that you have all that background, let’s get to debugging the CrashLoopBackOff.</p><p>In order to understand what’s happening, it’s important to be able to inspect the container inside of k8s so the application has all the environment variables and dependent services.

Using the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> you discovered earlier, you can execute the intended startup command and see how the application is failing.</p><p>Depending on the container you’re running, it may be missing many of the tools necessary to debug your problem like: curl, lsof, vim; and if it’s someone else’s code, you probably don’t know which version of linux was used to create the image. We typically try all of the common package managers until we find the right one. Most containers these days use Alpine Linux (apk package manager) or a Debian, Ubuntu (apt-get package manager) based image. In some cases we’ve seen Centos and Fedora, which both use the yum package manager.</p><p>One of the following commands should work depending on the operating system:</p><ul><li><code>apk</code></li><li><code>apt-get</code></li><li><code>yum</code></li></ul><p>Dockerfile maintainers often remove the cache from the package manager to shrink the size of the image, so you may also need to run one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>apk update</code></li><li><code>apt-get update</code></li><li><code>yum makecache</code> </li></ul><p>Now you need to add the necessary tools to help with debugging. Depending on the package manager you found, use one of the following commands to add useful debugging tools:</p><ul><li><code>apt-get install -y curl vim procps inetutils-tools net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>apk add curl vim procps net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>yum install curl vim procps lsof</code></li></ul><p>At this point, it’s up to you to figure out the problem. You can edit files using vim to tweak the container until you understand what’s going on. If you forget all of the files you’ve touched on the container, you can alway kill the pod and the container will restart without your changes. Always remember to write down the steps taken to get the container working. You’ll want to use your notes to alter the Dockerfile or add commands to the container startup scripts. </p><h2 id="debugging-your-containers">Debugging Your Containers</h2><p>We have created a simple script to get all of the debuging tools, as long as you are working with a container that has curl pre-installed:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>/bin/sh -c </span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>curl</span><span> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/releaseapp-io/container-debug/main/install.sh</span><span>)</span><span>"</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve learnt how to spot and investigate the CrashLoopBackOff errors in containers.

<p>Client, executives, and business owners always have one question at the start of a software project:</p>



<h4><em>“When will it be done?”</em><em></em></h4>



<p>If you’ve been working in software development for more than a month, you know this question is a trap.</p>



<p>Software development isn’t an assembly line where each task is measured down to the second. You’re creating a product that’s literally never existed before. There will always be uncertainty about the timeline.</p>



<p>Even so, software development is a business, so we have to accommodate the people we build software for.</p>



<p>They need the best estimate we can give them, and we need to avoid promising something we can’t deliver.</p>



<p>Which brings me to the focus of this article:</p>



<h4><em>How can I create an estimated timeline that my stakeholders will accept—but won’t lead to unrealistic deadlines for me and my team?</em><em></em></h4>



<h2>Ideal Days vs. Story Points: Two Common Methods</h2>



<p>GRAPHIC</p>



<p>In the quest to create better project estimates, developers have come up with all kinds of systems.</p>



<p>Two very common ones are:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ideal days (or similar time-based estimates)</li><li>Story points</li></ol>



<p>Both can be used to create project timelines, and both have their pros and cons.</p>



<p>One method is reliable, data-driven, and stable.</p>

<h2>1. Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

<p>Here’s a simple definition of for the ideal days method of estimating work:</p>



<h4><em>Ideal days is an estimate of the number of days your team would take to complete a project if they worked on nothing else and had no interruptions.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>In this context, “interruptions” means anything that causes the team to stop work on the project, including team meetings, training, other projects, illness, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a team of three developers might estimate a total of 45 ideal days to complete a project. If they had no interruptions and worked on nothing else, that would be an estimated timeline of 15 days.</p>



<p>No team exists without at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;interruptions.</p>



<p>For that reason, many teams might estimate somewhere between 20 and 30 days in this situation, depending on how optimistic (or realistic) they are.</p>



<h3>Pros of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are two main pros to the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>It’s concrete and intuitive</li><li>Clients and outside stakeholders understand it immediately</li></ul>



<p>When you tell a client, “this project should take 20 days,” you don’t have to educate them about the process you’re using or a new idea. They already understand the concept of time estimates expressed in hours, days, or months.</p>



<p>In most cases, clients and outside stakeholders will ask for an estimate given in days, weeks, or months—which is the main reason the ideal days method is so popular.</p>



<h3>Cons of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are three major problems with the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>Human beings are scientifically proven to be outrageously bad at estimating how long things will take;</li><li>Ideal days are often calculated based on the ideal case scenario, not a data-backed review of actual work completed on similar projects;</li><li>In practice, software teams often miss their promise date when using the ideal days method.</li></ul>



<p>This is not news to developers, of course. It’s no secret that we’re all bad at estimating time.</p>



<p>Despite these drawbacks, though, ideal days remain a popular method of estimating time. That brings us to the other most popular method: Story points.</p>



<h2>2. Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1270" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg" alt="Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-768x381.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1536x762.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-2048x1016.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a definition of story points:</p>



<h4><em>Story points are an estimate of the effort—not time—required to complete a task within a larger project.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>As you probably know if you’re reading this article, the term “story points” comes from the idea of user stories, a key idea within Scrum and Agile project management methodologies.</p>



<p>If you’re creating a new report for small business owners, for example, your user story might say:</p>



<p><em>As a small business owner, I want a daily report of my revenue for the previous day.</em><em></em></p>



<p>Story points are the estimates of the effort it will take to build all the features needed to create the experience described in the user story.</p>



<h3>Story Points Use a Relative Scale</h3>



<p>Story points are often assigned using the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) or some other relative scale.</p>



<p>We may not know <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how big a task is, but we know that changing a background from blue to green might be a 1 while building a new drop-down menu might be a 3 by comparison.</p>



<h4><em>Importantly, you should </em><em>never, ever</em><em>&nbsp;mix story points with ideal days or any other time-based estimation method. That includes the common practice of pegging story points to a certain number of hours or days (e.g., “One story point = one day”).</em><em></em></h4>



<p>Doing so strips your team of the most powerful reason to use story points—increasing your velocity.</p>



<h2>Pros of Story Points</h2>



<p>High-performance software teams don’t operate at one speed.</p>



<p>Instead, as they work their way through a project, they find ways to do it better, faster, and with less waste.</p>



<p>That means two vitally important things for your team:</p>



<ul><li>After you’ve been through three sprints, you will have a <em>very</em>&nbsp;strong understanding of how fast the team is moving—its velocity;</li><li>The velocity will increase over time as the team finds new ways to complete the work faster and with less waste.</li></ul>



<p>For example, it may take your team five days to complete the first 100 points of a project.</p>



<p>If so, your <em>velocity</em>&nbsp;over that first week is 100.</p>



<h3>Story Points Example Estimate</h3>



<p>Say you’re using one-week sprints for a 1,000 point project.</p>



<p>After three sprints, the team completes 104, 109, and 117 story points, respectively.</p>



<p>That’s an average velocity of 110, which is very strong evidence of the team’s capacity for this particular project <em>even with</em>&nbsp;normal interruptions. This is in stark contrast to the ideal days method, which assumes no interruptions and no other priorities.</p>



<p>You can now go to your stakeholders and confidently report that the 1,000 point project should be complete in a total of nine weeks.</p>



<p>If your team is increasing its velocity as it works (as it should!) there is a very good chance you’ll be able to deliver the project <em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of your promised delivery date.</p>



<h2>The Cons of Story Points</h2>



<p>While story points have many advantages, there are a few downsides, including:</p>



<ul><li>Story points are abstract and difficult to understand;</li><li>You might not be able to make a good timeline estimate right at the outset of a new project;</li><li>You’ll have to work hard to educate clients about the method and communicate with them often about the team’s progress.</li></ul>



<p>The abstract nature of story points means you’ll have to work much harder at communicating with clients, executives, and outside stakeholders.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the project, they’ll want you to tell them <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how long the project will take—along with how much it will cost.</p>



<p>And in truth, you won’t <em>really</em>&nbsp;have an accurate estimate for them. It will be three sprints before you have an accurate velocity number you can use to make a data-backed projection.</p>



<p>For that reason, your initial estimates will be more uncertain than your estimates once you get the team moving.</p>



<p>That issue will be a point of concern for many clients, salespeople, or executives. They’ll want a firm timeline <em>before</em>&nbsp;they approve the project.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s a straightforward way to create high-quality initial estimates even before you have a data-backed velocity number.</p>



<h3>How to Create an Initial Delivery Estimate Using Story Points</h3>



<p>The good news is: initial estimates using the story point method aren’t any less uncertain than the ideal days method.</p>



<p>If your team has completed similar projects to the one being proposed, review the completed sprint boards, then use the velocity the team achieved on those projects as a starting point for your estimate.</p>



<p>This lets you create realistic, data-backed estimates for the timeline of your project, ones that will get more accurate as you begin the project and start completing the work.</p>



<p>As a bonus, if you review the completed sprint boards of similar projects with your client or stakeholders as you give them your initial estimate, it will make you look like you <em>really</em>&nbsp;know what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Data-driven methods have that effect on people. 🙂</p>



<h3>Story Points Create Better Outcomes</h3>



<p>Despite its downsides, we believe story points create better outcomes for everyone involved in software development, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fewer last-minute overtime or weekend work;</li><li>More on-time projects;</li><li>Happier clients;</li><li>Happier developers;</li><li>Less overtime and write-offs—which leads to more profitable projects.</li></ul>



<h2>Use Time Tracking with Story Points for Full Visibility Within Your Sprints</h2>



<p>Story points are awesome for scoping and planning work, and velocity (once you have a real number based on at least iterations) is the most accurate way we know to calculate project timelines.</p>



<p>Together, story points and velocity are the antidote to fussy clients who want to know: “How long will this take!?”</p>



<p>Internally, however, once you’re inside a sprint, story points leave a gap in your visibility to the work being completed.</p>



<p>For example, imagine your team sets 20 points of work for a two-week sprint.</p>



<p>In Scrum, you never move a task to “complete” until it’s fully complete—ready for the user to use.</p>



<p>Five days into a ten-day sprint, you might still have 20 points remaining as “unfinished” on the sprint board.</p>



<p>You’re halfway through the sprint, but you have no information about how it’s going. You have 20 points of work remaining, but will it take five days to complete as you planned? Three days? 15 days?</p>



<p>At this point in the sprint, you have no data to make that projection.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like waking up in the morning, looking at your clock, but the only data you see is the year. It’s useful to know what year we’re in, but it doesn’t tell you if you’re running …</p></div></div>

<h4>The GPD P2 Max is a hyper-powered cross between a palm pilot and an ultrabook - it's a cyberdeck by any other name...</h4>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<table>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>


</td>

<img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/ghetto_cyberdeck.png" alt="The most ghetto cyberdeck... IN THE WORLD!">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

	<h2>
Why though?
	</h2>
	<p>
I know, I know, the topic is already covered by some excellent tutorials and explanations. To name a few,

	<ul>
	<li>

	<li>
Bruce Dawson's <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/category/floating-point/">blog posts</a>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
But I think that reexplaining some obscure concepts with different words (and buttons) might still help someone understand them better. And in the end, make fewer mistakes, write faster code, and create better software in general.
	</p>
	<p>
So I wrote this tutorial. It has C++ code samples, clickable models, and even quests and puzzles. I used everything, every trick I know to explain things in the clearest way possible. If you think your understanding of floating-point computations still could be improved after reading all the other tutorials, this page should help you.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's get started, shall we?
	</p>

	<h2>
But first! Meet the 6-bit <span id="index_integer_number">integer number</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Floating-point numbers were invented to represent real numbers. Like <span>0.5</span> or <span>3.1415926</span>. The ones that can't be represented by integers like <span>1</span> or <span>3</span>. But in fact, floating-point numbers are made of integers, so you should probably learn them first.
	</p>
	<p>
At the very low-level, all computers do is crunch integers. And only some finite subset of them. Computers operate with bit tuples, and there are only as many different combinations of bits as <span>2<sup>n</sup></span> where <span>n</span> is the length of a tuple, and these combinations are your numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have 1 bit, you can only have two numbers: 0 and 1. If you have 2 bits, there are 0, 1, 2, and 3. If you have 8 bits, you have 256 different numbers, if 16 — 65 536, 32 — 4 294 967 296, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
Since 2-bit tuples provide too few numbers and 64 bit — too many, here's a nice and compact model of a 6-bit integer number.
	</p>
	<canvas id="integer" width="640" height="200"></canvas>
	
	
	<form>
		<b>Quest 1.</b> Please make the model show <span>31</span>.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
Integer numbers are not universally standardized but there are some common conventions. For instance, the most common way to represent negative integers is by using the higher half of the range.
	</p>
	<p>
This means that by constantly incrementing the model, at some point you'll see: <span>..., 29, 30, 31, -32, -31, -30, ...</span>
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 2.</b> Please make the model show <span>-32</span>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
It looks a little odd when you meet this jump, but it all makes perfect sense when we see all the range in one picture. Let's pick an even simpler model. The 1-digit decimal number will do.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr><td><b>Unsigned 1-digit decimal</b></td><td><b>Signed 1-digit decimal<b></b></b></td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>-5</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>-4</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>-3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8</td><td>-2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>9</td><td>-1</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	<p>
The first half of the range is shared between signed and unsigned types. Then there's a leap back for the signed ones. After that, they diverge by exactly half a range.
	</p>
	<p>
If you take overflows into consideration, it starts to seem natural. Yes, signed numbers overflow at half-range, but unsigned numbers overflow too, only half a range later. It's like two continuous rolls of numbers going along each other.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr><td><b>Unsigned 1-digit decimal</b></td><td><b>Signed 1-digit decimal<b></b></b></td></tr>
	<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
	<tr><td>9</td><td>-1</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>0</span></td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>1</span></td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>2</span></td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>3</span></td><td>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>4</span></td><td>4</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>5</span></td><td><span>-5</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>6</span></td><td><span>-4</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>7</span></td><td><span>-3</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>8</span></td><td><span>-2</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>9</span></td><td><span>-1</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td><span>0</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td><span>1</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td><span>2</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td><span>3</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td><span>4</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>-5</td></tr>
	<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>
Please don't write your code expecting this behavior, though. Integer overflows are not universally standardized. And even if they work properly for your case, exploiting overflows makes code obscure, error-prone, and often non-portable.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Puzzle 1.</b> What will this C++ program print out?
		<p>
This puzzle requires significant C++ knowledge. If you're not familiar with the language, feel free to guess.
		</p>
		<div>
		<pre id="code_1">  // built with Clang 3.8 on Intel Core i7
  uint16_t a = 50'000;
  uint16_t b = 50'000;
  uint64_t c = a*b;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; c;</pre>
		</div>
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
With proper convention, integer numbers may represent some non-integer values. For instance, <span>0.45</span> of a meter is <span>45</span> centimeters. <span>45.6</span> centimeters is <span>456</span> millimeters.
	</p>
	<div>
	<p>
456 mm = 45.6 cm = 0.456 m
	</p></div>
	<p>
It's just a matter of representation. It's all about where to put the decimal point.
	</p>

	<h2>
Speaking of which, meet the 6-bit <span id="index_fixed_point_number">fixed-point number</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
With things like price tags or body temperature, we know where the decimal point goes. These things could be manipulated with the decimal point in mind.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Just as that, we can turn an integer number into a fixed-point number by assigning a place to put the binary point. In this model, the binary point is put after two bits, so it's still an integer, but now it measures quarters, so it can now represent some subset of real numbers such as <span id="fp_15">1.5</span>.
	</p>
	<canvas id="fixed" width="640" height="200"></canvas>
	
	<p>
Fixed-point numbers are still integers, but they are integer numbers of fractions.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 3.</b> Please make the model show <span>-8</span>.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
You can add and subtract them like the regular numbers, but you have to introduce more elaborate rules for division and multiplication. And you have to watch for overflows and underflows accordingly.
	</p>
	<p>
Sometimes fixed-points are fine, but they can get cumbersome with a lot of calculations. With fixed bit tuple size, you have to choose where to put the binary point to lose as little precision as possible on any arithmetic operation. Wouldn't it be great if something did that for you?
	</p>

	<h2>
And finally, meet the 6-bit <span id="index_floating_point_number">floating-point number</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Floating-point numbers are that popular because they work fine even if you don't think about where the decimal point is where it shall appear after the computation.
	</p>
	<p>
They come from <i>scientific</i> (also known as <i>exponential</i>) notation. With this notation, you can compactly write both astronomical and subatomic values.
	</p>
	<div>
	<p>
	m<sub>Sun</sub>: <b>1.989e+30</b> kg</p><nobr>Mass of the Sun, which is 1989000000000000000000000000000 kg</nobr>
	<p>
	m<sub>e</sub>: <b>9.1093897e-31</b> kg</p><nobr>Mass of an electron, which is 0.0000000000000000000000000000091093897 kg</nobr>
	</div>
	<p>
Just like a number in scientific notation, a floating-point number has a sign, some meaningful digits, and an exponent.
	</p>
	<canvas id="floating" width="640" height="200"></canvas>
	
	<p>
The three major differences are:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>
it's all binary not decimal;
	</li>
	<li>
the exponent value goes before meaningful digits;
	</li>
	<li>
and since it's binary, and all the numbers, except for <span>0</span>, start with <span>1</span>, you don't even have to write down the first <span>1</span> most of the time. It will be there implicitly. Saves you a whole bit!
	</li>
	</ol>
	
	<form>
		<b>Quest 4.</b> Please make the model show <span>1</span>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Only for the very small numbers, when we want our exponent to be smaller than we can afford, we omit the implied <span>1</span>. In scientific notation, it's like writing <span>0.00123e-45</span>. It's not normalized. So we call these numbers <i><span id="index_subnormal_numbers">subnormal numbers</span></i> or <i><span id="index_denormalized_numbers">denormalized numbers</span></i>.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 5.</b> Please make the model show <span>0.25</span>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Since you're still working with bits, and every number is still just an integer in disguise, you can imagine a floating-point number as an integer number <nobr>of <span>2<sup>n</sup>s</span></nobr>.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 6.</b> Please make the model show <span>2</span>.
		
		
	</form>
   <p>
Unlike integer numbers, floating-point numbers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">standardized</a>, and the standard specifies several useful conventions. The whole range of possible bits consists not only of numbers, but of two distinct zeros, two values for infinitely large values, and a whole subrange of “not a number”s.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
To understand what are the special infinite values for, you should probably understand floating-point zeros first.
	</p>
	<p>
They are not actual zeros. Instead, they model anything that is absolutely smaller than the smallest representable number. Of course, they may occasionally represent an actual zero, but there is no way to tell if they are. So they should be treated as small numbers and not <span>0</span>. And as such, they deserve to retain their signs.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_2">  auto min_float
    = std::numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::denorm_min();
  std::cout &lt;&lt; min_float;
  // prints 1.4013e-45


  std::cout &lt;&lt; min_float / 2.f;
  // prints 0


  std::cout &lt;&lt; -min_float / 2.f;
  // prints -0
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
The smallest representable number is the smallest denormalized number. One half of it is semantically a number, but pragmatically a zero.
	</p>
	<p>
Denormalized values are not universally available. If you don't want that precision, you can win some performance by turning them off.
	</p>
	<p>
Speaking of performance, some of the compiler optimizations are algebraic. This means that the compiler optimizes floating-point numbers such as if they were real. Usually, it's not a problem. Sometimes it is.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Puzzle 2.</b> What will this C++ program print out?
		<div>
		<pre id="code_3">  std::cout &lt;&lt; 0 - (min_float / 2.f);
		</pre></div>
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
When you divide a non-zero number by zero, you get infinity. And just like floating-point zeros are not zero, these are not infinite. These are just numbers that are too big to be represented.
	</p>
	<p>
There are also numbers that can't possibly be represented in this model at all, like square roots of negative numbers. Technically, they are still numbers, but being complex numbers and not real, they don't have the representation. Operations that take numbers as input and can't provide numbers as output return special “<span id="index_not_a_number">not a number</span>” values then.
	</p>

	<h2>
<span id="index_representation_error">Representation error</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Of course, numbers that get to be represented in floating-point numbers, are usually represented with an error. We have only that many bits, that many combinations, and the real number's range is infinite. You can't squeeze an infinite range into a finite set.
	</p>
	<p>
When a number doesn't have the representation, we pick the nearest number that has one instead.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
The difference between their values is our representation error.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 7.</b> Using the dial, please enter a number with the error of <nobr>exactly <span>0.001</span></nobr>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
The common misconception is: since our smallest representable numbers are small, the representation error should be small too. But remember, we are talking about integer numbers of <span>2<sup>n</sup></span>s. The greater the <span>n</span>, the greater the possible representation error is.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 8.</b> Using the dial, please enter a number with the error <nobr>of <span>1000</span></nobr>.
		
		
	</form>

	<h2>
<span id="index_computational_error">Computational error</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Still, the representation error is not our worst enemy. Any real-world number we collect from a sensor, or a user interface, has its own error anyway. And it usually dwarfs the representation error of floating-point numbers. 
	</p>
	<p>
However, as we process the data, we introduce computational error, too.
	</p>
	
	

	<p>
Computational error is not …</p></div></div>

January 26, 2021 | https://digitstodollars.com/2021/01/21/hardware-is-hard/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://digitstodollars.com/2021/01/21/hardware-is-hard/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We have written a lot about the blind spot the US venture ecosystem has for <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2019/09/30/3042/">semiconductors</a> (<a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/08/10/not-a-drop-for-you/">and here</a>) and hardware more generally. We recently helped a venture firm conduct due diligence on an electronics company, which put us in the awkward position of having to walk in someone else’s shoes. Sympathy for the devil, and all that. In our posts we have attempted to be fair, pointing out that US VCs are making sensible economic decisions albeit on a short-sighted viewpoint. Investing in hardware is much more capital intensive and thus risky than investing in software. In this post, we want to work through some of the math behind that. </p>



<p>Let’s say we have a company, Unicorn Electronics, that wants to build The SmartHorn <sup>TM</sup>, a device that magically solves customers’ problems perfectly. How do we get the company to “escape velocity” – positive cashflow sufficient to fund the company’s immediate growth needs?</p>



<p>First, Unicorn needs to design the Horn. Depending on how complex the device is this can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, from a third party design shop. Some people can do this design themselves, others are going to need outside help. For our purposes, let’s say the Horn design costs $500,000. This amount gets the company the “blueprints” and a few prototypes.  </p>



<p>But most devices today are fairly complex. Even if the hard computation is done in the cloud or in the app, the device itself needs to be able to function, to be programmed and to communicate with the Internet. That means firmware. This is low-level software, and not only is their no standard “firmware” programming language or operating system, pretty much every chip company has its own instruction language. Hiring firmware engineers is not that expensive in dollars, but it can be very expensive in time. Here’s a typical scenario. The design shop hands the firmware designers some prototypes. The firmware team finds a bug that requires a new wire or capacitor. So the design firm has to build (by hand) a new prototype. The firmware team then finds that two of the chips are not speaking to each other – the Bluetooth and the temperature sensor for instance. Is the problem in one chip or the other or somewhere in the wiring in between? Often this will mean the design team needs to spin up yet another prototype. And since these teams are likely in different cities, if not different countries, every re-spin loses days in shipping and re-work. </p>



<p>So far, we have spent $500,000 and a month on the design, and $100,000 and four months on firmware.</p>



<p>Now we have to find a manufacturer. This company will need to create tools and molds as well as designing a manufacturing flow. They can do this fairly quickly, but as they are operating on expensive machine tools, they will have minimum quantity requirements. These can be as low as a few thousand units, but here is where the costs really start to add up. </p>



<p>Let’s say the SmartHorn costs $100 in parts and manufacturing, but the manufacturer requires a minimum of 5,000 units. Then the tricky part becomes sourcing parts. The global electronics supply chain is incredibly tight right now. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/10/27/what-is-happening-to-the-supply-chain/">We wrote about this back in October</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html">New York Times was catching up last week</a>. Lead times for many parts can be several months, and frustratingly it is hard to predict with often some of the lowest value parts in the shortest supply. So add $500,000 (5,000 units X $100 BOM) and four months. </p>



<p>Then we enter into a whole sea of minutiae. The device will need various certifications UL, FCC, etc. Add $50,000, but fortunately this can be done while the manufacturing is ramping up. But there are bigger costs as well such as insurance. Most distributors (i.e. retail) and enterprise customers will want the company to maintain a range of insurance policies, tack on another $50,000 or so. Then we have to factor in shipping and customs and taxes, so maybe $20 per device. </p>



<p>Next up, the company has to factor in warranties and returns. The accountants have requirements for setting reserves for these, but a rough rule of thumb (sufficient for our purposes here only) is 10% of the costs of the materials needs to be set aside to cover the cost of returns and replacements. </p>



<p>Finally, the company has to contend with marketing. This amount can range from nothing to A Lot, depending on whether they are selling to consumers or to a single large enterprise customer. A basic PR budget and some content marketing runs about $50,000, plus or minus. </p>



<p>Adding this up we have the following budget:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Item</td><td>Amount</td><td data-align="center">Time</td></tr><tr><td>Design</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Firmware</td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacture</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Certification</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Shipping </td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Sub-total Cost of Goods Sold</td><td>$1,350,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Warranty Reserve</td><td>$135,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>$1,485,000</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>9 Months</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this has to take place before the company can collect any revenue, unless they have done some form of crowdsourcing. So just to break even the company has to charge $297/unit, and to get a 50% gross margin the retail price would need to be $594. </p>



<p>We also need to factor in software costs. For this example, we will assume Unicorn Electronics does their own app and back-end software. The company could probably build all of the hardware and software with a team of ten people. If the average salary is $150,000 year (assume some expensive onshore talent and some less expensive offshore talent), the total comes out to $1.5 million for a year. </p>



<p>So $1.485 million in hardware costs and $1.5 million for headcount, for a total of $2.985 million. The company then sells 5,000 units for $594 a piece or $2.97 million in revenue and yielding a net <em><strong>loss</strong></em> of ($15,000). Hardware can be dispiriting.</p>



<p>The good news is that there is a heavy fixed costs component to this model, so tweaking a few variables can have a big impact. For instance, if they raise prices by $6/unit to an even $600, the net profit goes to $15,000 (positive). Sell an additional 1,000 units and the net profits are close to half a million dollars. If they sell 100,000 units then the company has a path to becoming a true Unicorn. There is a lot of leverage in the model, which is why people keep trying to build hardware. </p>



<p>That being said, the realities of hardware can be daunting. Take the $3 million the company needs to get a product out the door, a similarly sized team could build a software application that can potentially grow much faster and they would still have a million dollars to do customer acquisition. Compounding this, the software would come with a recurring revenue stream. The trouble with hardware is that for the company to grow, they have to come out with the Smart Horn 2 and the Smart Horn 3, and go through all of the above again, and again. </p>



<p>Hardware has immense financial leverage, but the upfront costs and more crucially the time required are daunting. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="https://rudderstack.com/blog/the-complete-customer-data-stack/">Your data warehouse is the platform your customer data stack is built on</a>. It acts as a robust central system for driving critical business decisions while maintaining a unified source of truth for your entire organization. Businesses are constantly looking to improve their product or marketing strategies to get an extra edge over their competitors. Data warehouses help you get that competitive edge by serving analytical data to make fact-based decisions that drive innovation and business growth. While teams turn those analysis-driven insights into strategies and tactics, it’s tough to activate the warehouse’s actual data that the insights are based on.</p>
<p>To make it easier to utilize and activate all of the analytics your teams build, we’re launching a new feature called RudderStack Warehouse Actions. Warehouse Actions enables you to leverage processed customer data stored in your data warehouse and directly route this enriched information to your entire customer data stack.</p>
<p>In this post, we detail Warehouse Actions. We explain how configuring your warehouse as a data source can fully unlock your data’s value, how Warehouse Actions works, some of its benefits, and how to set it up in RudderStack.</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iafB9gyoWtc?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<h2>Why Warehouse Actions?</h2>
<p>Data warehouses are an indispensable tool as they enable decision-makers to access data quickly through business intelligence tools, SQL clients, and other analytical applications. Without a data warehouse in place, you are forced to rely on the individual (siloed) applications you use and the raw data from each for analysis. </p>
<p>A warehouse helps guarantee that your data is unified, consistent, and high-quality by eliminating duplicate records, errors, and inconsistent information. It also enables your teams to perform deep analysis and modeling on your data, something that is nearly impossible without a warehouse.  Given the quality of the data in your warehouse and your teams’ can derive from it, it makes sense to use the customer data in your warehouse to activate your customer tools. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions makes feeding customer insights into your customer data pipelines easy by turning tables into event streams that can trigger activation in your downstream customer tools. </p>
<h2>How Warehouse Actions Works</h2>

    </span><figcaption>Warehouse Actions Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>RudderStack makes it easy to collect data from different sources, event and non-event, and securely ingest them into your warehouse. Once data is successfully ingested, your teams can then apply advanced queries or models to generate valuable data composites (either tables or views) that are frequently materialized (aka written) as their tables and stored in your data warehouse. For example, <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> can be used to transform data within your warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt turns these select statements into tables and views.</p>
<p>With Warehouse Actions, any updates to the analytics-derived datasets that live in your warehouse can be collected by RudderStack and pushed as events to all of your customer tools.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using a Warehouse Actions</h2>
<p>Even if collected and unified across multiple touchpoints, customer event data may lack the necessary information to build complete or enriched customer profiles. Event data alone doesn’t give context into any of the information stored in your customer master data, campaign data, or even your advertising data. When you have data from sources beyond events that could make your customer profiles better or enable deeper, more meaningful analysis, you need a data warehouse. Your warehouse is where you can combine all of these different types of customer data to define better customer profiles and derive more meaningful insights from more in-depth analysis. With Warehouse Actions, you can route the customer insights in your data warehouse to third-party tools for further activation. </p>
<p>For example, when running a new marketing campaign, you are often challenged with gathering the “right data” for personalized emails,  push notifications, or targeted audiences. This “right data” often starts with simple data, such as name and email address, and then expands to complex customer data, including behavioral traits, products viewed, subscriptions enrolled, and so on. All of the data you need to make the “right data” is either already in your data warehouse or easily could be. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions lets you action on the “right data”, routing the outputs of your team’s analysis to all of your customer tools. As a result, it is significantly easier to help your marketing teams build and automate things like customized recommendations for campaigns. Also, it allows your product team to build win-back flows for users likely to churn. </p>
<h2>Setting up Warehouse Actions in RudderStack</h2>
<p>We will use a real-world example to walk through how to set up Warehouse Actions. Let’s say your company wants to use the number of log-ins over seven days to calculate a lead score for new users. Multiple log-ins will increase the lead score. </p>
<p>Let’s also say that because you use RudderStack Event Stream and RudderStack Cloud Extract, you have the log-in event data from your website, iOS app, and Android app, as well as the lead records from Salesforce in your warehouse. You can use SQL (or another method of querying the data) to build a simple model for calculating each lead score. The result is a table in your warehouse that lists Salesforce leads and their associated score. </p>
<p>In Snowflake, the query to calculate lead score and produce a table might look something like this: </p>

<p>With Warehouse Actions, you can easily pull the updated lead profiles from the table in Snowflake back through RudderStack and send them to Salesforce, meaning your sales team will have the most up-to-date status on new signups. Because the table is translated into an event stream, you can also route it to any other tools that need the lead score, like marketing automation and customer experience platforms. </p>
<p>Configuring Warehouse Actions is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Pachyderm Uses Warehouse Actions to Automate Their Onboarding E-mails</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a>, an enterprise-grade, open-source data science platform, implemented Warehouse Actions for lead qualification. After creating an account, the first action Pachyderm wants their customers to do is create a workspace. They encourage users to do this in a series of drip emails sent through <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>, but they don’t want these drip emails to go out to customers that have already created a workspace. This data is already in their data warehouse, and now, with Warehouse Actions, they can automatically exclude these customers from this drip email series.</p>

    <p>2021-01-26 08:59:23+00:00</p>
    <p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> is the “new” (13 years old already) display server technology on Linux, which is supposed to replace
the antiquated X11. It promises better security, performance, portability, everything, compared to X11, and
it sure does deliver, provided that you’re not using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">unsupported graphics cards</a>.
You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIctzAQOe44">this talk / rant about X11</a> to get an idea about how bad it is.</p>

<p>Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their window manager doesn’t have a
Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others, all having their unique feature-set). Some may wonder “hmm maybe I can port it myself”. I wrote this post to make you (re)consider that.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas of Wayland is that it’s merely a specialised IPC protocol, and the communication is
strictly between the clients (applications on your screen mainly) and the server.</p>

<p>The server is what we are interested in now. Unlike X11, where the server is X.Org and the window manager
is just an X11 client with special privileges, on Wayland the window manager is also a server and a compositor. In fact, the correct terminology is “Wayland compositor”. This piece of software has the
task of doing everything it wants with the clients, which is usually among the lines of showing them
on the screen and giving them inputs events from your keyboards, mice, touchscreens etc. In fact, <a href="https://mir-server.io/">no one
stops you from leaving window management as an API</a>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I prefer using GNOME under Wayland, because it has the most stable, fully-featured and “just works”
experience there is. However, I wanted a better way of organising windows on my screen than leaving them
shuffled around. Tiling was also not good, because every time you launch a new window, the others get
shrunk to fit, which is not good on a small laptop display.</p>

<p>Luckily I discovered <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. It’s perfect for laptops, instead of
shrinking your windows, it just renders them off-screen. To switch between one or the other you can just
flick three fingers on the touchpad. It’s great. It’s also “glossy” and polished and has great UI and animations.</p>

<p>It has some disadvantages though, mainly concerning its speed. I find it sluggish, and it’s no surprise that
like all other GNOME Shell extensions, it’s a JavaScript behemoth. PaperWM still uses the GNOME Tweener
framework for its animations, which is entirely written in JS. Because of that, it needs to communicate with the main
GNOME compositor process on each operation. And because we’re talking animations, said operations happen
for <em>every frame</em>. That means there is JS executed for every frame, 60 times a second. It’s horrible!</p>

<p>BTW nowadays GNOME uses animations implemented in C (since GNOME 3.34), the “GNOME runs JS on every frame” statement is for the most part false today.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficiency of PaperWM, it also means that it drains my battery quickly, which is bad for a laptop!</p>

<p>So, because I am a student with a lot of free time, together with <a href="https://alexge50.com/">Alex</a> we figured we shall develop a scrollable tiling (PaperWM-like) Wayland compositor. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard">Cardboard</a> (get it??). It also has the nicety of
being controlled and configured by a remote control program, like bspwm.
Neither Alex nor I had experience with any kind of Wayland development. However, I wrote <a href="https://tudorr.ro/software/windowchef/">an X11 window manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tudurom/disputils/">some XRandR querying utilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom/ruler">a window rule daemon</a>. Alex has experience
with <a href="https://git.alexge50.com/a/gie">graphics programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexge50/libwatchpoint">C++ devilry</a>.</p>

<p>Our “tech stack” was <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>, which is an exceptional Wayland compositor library (apart from its lack of documentation). The description from the README is spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I (because I wrote most of the Wayland-interfacing code) realised soon that there is still a lot of boilerplate involved in writing a compositor, much more than for an X11 window manager,
namely setting up your own rendering code, registering and storing input devices and screens in your own data structures, passing input events to windows, calculating bounds for bars
and other overlays (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml"><code>layer-shell</code></a>) and others. X11 handles all of this for you,
the window manager just reacts to events regarding window inputs to establish its behaviour. With Wayland, you handle everything, even with wlroots. The upside is that if you don’t like the way X11 does something
(which is a given), not only that you can do it in your own way on Wayland, you are required to do so.</p>

<p>Because we weren’t really prepared for what writing a compositor involved, we thought that it must be approached like a “normal” program: split code into modules, each with their own responsibilities, call wlroots to do its thing, the usual stuff.
We are writing a program in our way and wlroots lets us “interface with Wayland”. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>We were as careful as possible to separate responsibilities into different structures / classes, yet we ended up with most functions taking a pointer to <code>Server</code> as their first parameter.
<code>Server</code> is a singleton holding all the other “sub-modules” in it. It represents the compositor itself. The reason most functions need <code>Server</code> is that everything is related to everything,
not because of a mistake in structuring the code, but by design. This is what a compositor requires, the problem of writing a compositor is somewhat complex because it has a great deal variables ranging
from input events, drawing on the screen, creating behaviours that the user leverages, reacting to application events. All of them can affect the other, you can not separate the thing into modules.
The best you can do is separate the code in different files and folders based on some criteria, like grouping data structures with related routines.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take damage tracking. For starters, because the compositor is also tasked with rendering the content and displaying it on the screen, we have some rendering code that runs on every frame.
Damage tracking is tracking which areas of the screen have changed in an amount of time. An example would
be typing a letter in the terminal. The place where the cursor is changes to the letter you typed, and the cursor advances.
If there is no change, the frame is not rendered, as it would look
exactly the same as the previous one, which would be a waste of processor time.
This way, instead of re-rendering everything 60 times a second (I assume that you use a common display), we can render and paint as little as possible to account for the changed region.
You can read <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2019/intro-to-damage-tracking/">an introduction to damage tracking</a> written by one of the main developers of wlroots.</p>

<p>I have just implemented the most basic form of damage tracking: do not render the frame if nothing on the screen changes.
It doesn’t track the damage itself, just that it exists.
To do this, I first added a <code>wlr_output_damage</code> object to my <code>Output</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct Output {
</span>    struct wlr_output* wlr_output;
    struct wlr_output_damage* wlr_output_damage;
<span>+   struct wlr_box usable_area;
</span>    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure tracks the damage accumulated per-output, as rendering is also per-output (this means that you can use screens of different refresh rates, yay!). However, to make this initial attempt at
damage tracking easier, I decided to trigger rendering for all attached outputs. I added a <code>set_dirty()</code> function to the <code>OutputManager</code> class that does just that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>OutputManager</span><span>::</span><span>set_dirty</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>output</span> <span>:</span> <span>outputs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>wlr_output_damage_add_whole</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>wlr_output_damage</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This marks every output as entirely damaged, and as such triggers a render.</p>

<p>With this function set into place, I had to identify when does the “screen” change, namely when a window “commits” (changes its contents) and when a window is moved. The window move is one example
of the way everything is related to everything in the …</p></article></div>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has a very lively and fast-paced open source ecosystem, with a ton of contributors working on a ton of awesome projects.</p><p>And if you are asking – what can I build in Rust? The answer is almost everything.</p><p>This article will feature some of the open-source Rust libraries, frameworks, and repositories that could be useful to study or use for your own project.</p><p>For your convenience, I’ve split them into fields such as web development, game development, blockchain, and others. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="web-development-frameworks-for-rust">Web development frameworks for Rust</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/t4/t4mp0qkr.1_(45)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust web development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Can you build a web app with Rust? Definitely!</p><p>Rust has multiple extremely fast web frameworks – Rocket, Actix Web, and Yew – and you can use the one that matches your needs and preferences.</p><h3 id="rocket">Rocket</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket">Rocket</a> is the most accessible web framework in the Rust ecosystem for beginners. It is highly customizable and helps you kickstart a new application quickly. At the same time, it avoids a lot of unnecessary boilerplate. Rocket also has many features included, which means that you won’t need to go far from the framework to build everything you need.</p><p>In contrast to Actix Web, the framework runs on nightly Rust – the “experimental” version of the language.</p><h3 id="actix-web">Actix Web</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web">Actix Web</a> is usually thought to be more performant and stable than Rocket. Underneath, it works with the actor model used in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#process-oriented">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html">Akka</a>.</p><p>In contrast to Rocket, it’s less “batteries included”, meaning that you will most likely need to use third-party libraries for extra functionality.</p><h3 id="yew">Yew</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">Yew</a> is a Rust framework for creating web apps with WebAssembly. Among its main benefits, it lists a component-based framework like in React and Elm, outstanding performance because of the multi-thread support, and JavaScript interoperability.</p><p>As of now, it is not production-ready but should be an excellent choice for side projects and internal tooling, especially if you want to work with WASM.</p><h3 id="zola">Zola</h3><p>If you need something quick and simple to serve a static website, <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola">Zola</a> is a fantastic tool to create fast and scalable web pages without any other dependencies or JS bloat.</p><h3 id="warp">Warp</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> is a web server framework written in Rust. In comparison to Rocket and Actix, it is rather slim for a web framework and will provide you only with basic functionality out of the box.</p><h2 id="game-development">Game development</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/cu/cubf89sc.2_(36)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust game development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is exceptional for game development for the same reason that C++ is: it is predictably performant. Here are some of the engines you can use to build your own Rust game.</p><h3 id="bevy">Bevy</h3><p>Two of the main Rust game engines are Bevy and Amethyst. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">Bevy</a> is the newer and cooler one. It is a simple, data-driven engine and can essentially be called Amethyst 2.0 since it is heavily inspired by it.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qjc0V58lB7A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>For more info on Bevy, you can check out the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">Bevy book</a>.</p><h3 id="amethyst">Amethyst</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">Amethyst</a> is the more mature one of the two and, because of that, has more features that you might need for a large-scale project and better integrations with 3rd party libraries. But, Bevy is catching up fast. If you are searching for an engine for your new project, I’d recommend looking at them both and seeing which one you like better.</p><h3 id="ggez">ggez</h3><p>If you are searching for something simple to start off, <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez">ggez</a> is a lightweight cross-platform game framework for making 2D games with minimal friction.</p><hr><p>If you want to read more on game development in Rust, check out <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">Are we game yet?</a></p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating systems</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/zd/zdu35vif.3_(34)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust operating systems" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is an excellent alternative to C in operating system development since it offers the same level of performance while taking care of memory safety.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've made it to the third and final part. Incredible. I applaud you. <br></p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/2020-in-review-1">Part 1: The Product and the Trivia Itself </a></li><li><a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/2020-in-review-2">Part 2: The Business Side of WCT</a></li><li>Part 3: The Technical Side of WCT ( &gt;&gt; you're reading this part)</li></ul><p>We love writing trivia and we love turning that trivia-love into trivia-money, but we also love making software. At the end of the day, without software I’m just a man yelling out random trivia facts into my webcam.<br></p><p>Here’s the four key technical areas where we invested Ryan’s brainpower:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Transitioning to Webflow</li><li>A/B Testing Trivia Difficulty Settings</li><li>Digging the Distribution of Slack and Teams</li><li>Automation and Algorithms</li></ol><h2>1. Transitioning to Webflow</h2><p>Remember how earlier I wrote that co-founder Ryan had written 100% of our code? Well, we decided to make life easier by moving the front end “marketing site” off Ryan’s plate and onto mine.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Inspired by this <a href="https://twitter.com/tylertringas/status/1250521285630836741?s=21">Tyler Tringas tweet</a>, we started looking into what it would take to migrate our existing “marketing site” onto a “no-code” platform like Webflow. Well, not like Webflow. Specifically Webflow.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We found a contractor through Webflow’s <a href="https://experts.webflow.com/">market of “Experts”</a> and in two weeks we had fully migrated our site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d7405fce7407ccfeb2_0qaOYceifcBgW2wIF5bw4lbZMUZJwYAFAidQZ08w2_mP8N2LMRcFEXmxIHRX02wivu-DEzeWXj33cVVC5-7ZuBXL02WFJGfewz6KdpMSqp-OfDE4Imjiz1KgDf5eO3UmUTNIOEPH.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The website today as seen via Webflow.</figcaption></figure><p>Our site. Not our entire app. We created a subdomain so that everything behind “auth” (i.e. logging in) remains app.watercoolertrivia.com. That is our web application, and Ryan builds those pages with our other engineering contributors.<br></p><p>Moving the marketing site to my plate meant I could build new pages quickly, run promotions, and set up design tests without slowing down Ryan from building more important and more impactful features. Plus I got to up-skill. I’m no Webflow expert, but I can scratch together a <a href="http://yearly-faves.com/">fun side project</a> every now and then on the platform now. <br></p><h2>2. A/B Testing Trivia Difficulty Settings</h2><p>A/B testing is one of the many deities in the polytheistic church of Silicon Valley. Or something. So we hopped aboard.<br></p><p>Specifically, we’d heard for a few months that groups were disengaged during their free four-week trial of Water Cooler Trivia because the trivia questions were too hard. We heard this feedback, but didn’t act. That makes us bad entrepreneurs. Oops!<br></p><p>Then we did act.&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>We tweaked what it means to be an “Easy” quiz. It used to mean that we give you questions with an average 70% correct. We moved that to a floor instead of an average.</li><li>For half of new trials, we <em>defaulted</em> the group into the Easy setting rather than the Medium difficulty setting we had traditionally used as default.<br></li></ol><p>Making that change to half the groups meant we could measure the impact.</p><h3>The results</h3><p>Ultimately, the easier difficulty setting had a statistically-significant impact on increasing the share of free trials that converted to paying Water Cooler Trivia customers. Specifically,&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>For groups with easier quizzes, the share submitted increased by 5 percentage points (+10% relative)</li><li>For groups with easier quizzes, the # of correct responses per quiz increased from 5.1 to 5.8 per quiz (most quizzes are 10 questions). Getting more questions right feels good.</li><li>For groups with harder quizzes, they actively <em>changed</em> their difficulty setting away from the default at 2.5x the rate of groups with easier quizzes<br></li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d78be75fd0ab80c098_YCICSmmsV_F2HFnlX6Iw7a8htrNM6VkcrDjkNIWGCWRF8tVpvpn8VJbtw5HUhkGslaJ4LLh1RYqdT_xzHTaVRl3mUsDe-YxSSSIyMyAEMj-D0C_y8XLiijG9jaOltTEZ_jtCB0WC.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Yep, we track our experiment results in Google Sheets.</figcaption></figure><p>So we rolled out the winning treatment. And eventually we launched even more difficulty settings. Accessibility rules.</p><h2>3. Digging the Distribution of Slack and Teams</h2><p>Technically our Slack integration was released in late 2019 and our Teams integration was released in early 2021. <em>Editor’s note: the integration is in the final stages of Microsoft’s approval process as of Jan 25, 2021</em>. However, we still consider integrations a key part of our year.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d7ace92c3cb295bc25_nwdtr8PDiCecKwFj7tycNeD2EUG9_ruXUa222ZKUgerLRypAm1B3ZqQyoBSTrEQ7GXDqh1Ldw8F2kFCIL-jEOuKJTuXfnxWEIhAEpV6X2NBMPF-GgFpqTesr9gQB_ZZrGTMtewqw.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Slack works on mobile as you can clearly tell here.</figcaption></figure><p>Groups that sign up via Slack engage with Water Cooler Trivia about 2.5x more than groups that sign up via email. Realizing that, we added “Sign up with Slack” directly to our homepage. The popularity of both Slack and Teams exploded during the shift to remote work, so we doubled down on our product marketing and experience in the Slack and Teams apps.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Automation and Algorithms</h2><p>Free-text trivia rules. It’s more satisfying to pull that European capital or Indonesian ingredient from the back of your mind than randomly guessing multiple choice option C.<br></p><p>Of course, grading free-text responses is significantly more challenging than multiple-choice and true-false. We increase the challenge by declaring “spelling doesn’t matter” on each quiz. It’s cool with us if you don’t know the difference between Schwarzenegger and Schwartzenegger.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d7b8169256a65024e8_7e98ggQzpLL_mBw4FpCn_oVrc2QbtZBRRsFIooEVjMBGQVMuRgZKqMtOlWQQ7wnGaXi-qIvNM6ud9jdTAAxF9vXuPsy2XMpTTOKcmInKGlnv0-Q0bpaSJSf7GwAyWxUSdpK3Xofi.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We did use a keyboard to make these changes, but it wasn't this keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p>Historically, we’ve used a few clever tricks to keep false negatives and positives low (&lt;0.5% of all responses). As the business has grown, we’ve had more manual grading on our plate, often requiring grading in the middle of the night.<br></p><p>We worked with a data scientist to assess eight different free-text matching algorithms on a set of thousands of our own hand-graded trivia responses. Some of the concepts:</p><ul role="list"><li>Vowel-stripping</li><li>Levenshtein distance</li><li>Token sort ratio</li><li>Token set ratio<br></li></ul><p>Unsurprisingly, we quickly discovered a tradeoff between&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Increasing the share of responses “autograded” and</li><li>Minimizing error rate<br></li></ul><p>At one extreme, the “fuzzy partial ratio” matching algorithm (more detail <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy">here</a>) was the most “aggressive” variant.&nbsp; Although it would have reduced our manual grading by ~50%, it was likely to introduce hundreds of grading mistakes per week.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We opted for a more conservative approach: “fuzzy token sort ratio.” We expect it to reduce our manual grading burden by ~10-15% without adding an increase in errors.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, in way more detail than you wanted to know, that was our 2020 at Water Cooler Trivia HQ. We’re thrilled to have you with us as we roll out more features and <a href="http://app.watercoolertrivia.com/signup">keep the weekly trivia fun rolling</a> for your team in 2021.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eac6192807ea6b9679cf771/5fd2e2b18c2626f02925e9ad_Screen%20Shot%202020-12-07%20at%201.31.43%20PM.png" height="148" alt="Collin Waldoch - one of the Water Cooler Trivia founders"></p><div><p>Collin Waldoch is a co-founder of Water Cooler Trivia.&nbsp;He writes the questions.

<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sq/index.html"><code>sq</code></a>, version 0.23, which is meant for general use.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is a command-line tool that intends to expose much (but not all!)
of the functionality that the library provides.  Although we fully
intend for <code>sq</code> to be an OpenPGP swiss army knife, and that the truly
arcane should—in general—be possible, we firstly want <code>sq</code> to be
usable by humans at the command line.  We understand this to mean that
it should be possible to use <code>sq</code> to tweak and twiddle OpenPGP data.
But, those who have the desire to use Sequoia to frob it will need to
use the library.  And, they are probably better served by it anyway.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> has a subcommand-style interface similar to git.  This has the
advantage that every command has its own option name space, which
makes it much easier to understand exactly what options influence a
given command.</p>
<p>In terms of functionality, <code>sq</code> already provides the base operations
that any OpenPGP user needs in their day-to-day use: key generation
(<code>sq key generate</code>), encryption (<code>sq encrypt</code>) &amp; decryption (<code>sq decrypt</code>), signing (<code>sq sign</code>) &amp; verification (<code>sq verify</code>), key
certification (<code>sq certify</code>), and key server (<code>sq keyserver</code>) &amp; <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-11">web
key directory</a> (WKD) (<code>sq wkd</code>) interaction.  It also includes some
utility functions.  It can generate a WKD (<code>sq wkd generate</code>), encode
and decode <a href="https://autocrypt.org/level1.html#the-autocrypt-header">Autocrypt headers</a> (<code>sq autocrypt</code>), manipulate keyrings
(<code>sq keyring</code>), inspect OpenPGP-related data like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)"><code>file</code></a> does (<code>sq inspect</code>), and pretty print an OpenPGP file’s contents (<code>sq packet dump</code>).</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is still missing a fair amount of functionality.  In particular,
there is no public or private key store.  (Although prototypes exist.)
This means all OpenPGP certificates must be stored in files, which is
not scalable.  Also, many necessary and useful commands are still
missing.  For instance, it is not currently possible to add new
subkeys to a certificate, or change their expiration date.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is also not ready to be used from scripts.  Although we are
unlikely to change the current API, the bigger problem is that <code>sq</code>’s
output is not machine readable.  In the medium term, we plan to add a
<code>JSON</code>-output mode to every command.  Given the legion of <code>JSON</code>
parsers, this should effectively eliminate the need for tools that
consume <code>sq</code>’s output to have to parse it manually, and will hopefully
eliminate an entire class of common security-sensitive bugs.</p>
<p>Until now, we haven’t published <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sequoia-sq"><code>sq</code> on <code>crates.io</code></a>, and we’ve
discouraged packagers from including it in their distribution.  We now
think that <code>sq</code> is ready for general use.  If you have suggestions,
please <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/contribute/">reach out</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-demo">A Quick Demo</h2>
<p>Creating an OpenPGP key is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq key generate --export /tmp/alice.sec -u 'Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;'
</code></pre><p><code>sq</code> saves the key in <code>/tmp/alice.sec</code> and a generic revocation
certificate in <code>/tmp/alice.sec.rev</code>.</p>
<p>We can use <code>sq inspect</code> to examine the new key’s structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq inspect /tmp/alice.sec
/tmp/alice.sec: Transferable Secret Key.

</code></pre><p>Here we see that <code>sq</code> uses ECC by default, and generates a signing
subkey and an encryption subkey.  (<code>sq key generate</code> has options to
tweak both the cipher suite and the key’s structure.)  <code>sq</code> generates
a signing subkey by default to prevent an attacker from repurposing a
signature over data as a certification or binding signature.</p>
<p>The secret key material is unencrypted by default.  Supplying the
<code>--with-password</code> option will cause <code>sq</code> to prompt for a password and
use it to encrypt the secret key material.</p>
<p>We can use <code>sq packet dump</code> to get even more details:</p>

</code></pre><p>For the sake of brevity, I’ve only shown the User ID and the
corresponding self signature.  An interesting thing to note here is
the <code>salt@notations.sequoia-pgp.org</code> notation.  This is a random
32-byte value, which Sequoia inserts into every signature by default.
Because it is unpredictable, it is harder for an attacker to trick a
user into signing a specific message.</p>
<p>It is possible to get even more details by supplying the <code>--hex</code>
option to <code>sq packet dump</code>.  This causes it to print a descriptive map
of the packets' contents, which is useful if you are dissecting an
OpenPGP message.</p>

</code></pre><p>To turn a key into a certificate (i.e., to remove the secret key
material), we can use the <code>sq keyring filter</code> subcommand:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq keyring filter --to-certificate /tmp/alice.sec &gt; /tmp/alice.pgp
</code></pre><p>And using <code>sq inspect</code>, we see that we now have a certificate and not a
secret key:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq inspect /tmp/alice.pgp
/tmp/alice.pgp: OpenPGP Certificate.
...
</code></pre><p><code>sq keyring filter</code> also allows the user to specify a few predicates to
actually <em>filter</em> the keyring.</p>
<p><code>sq keyring</code> has other useful functionality.  It can split a keyring
into individual keys and it can merge multiple keys or keyrings
into a single keyring.</p>
<p>To sign and encrypt a message, we specify one or more certificates for
the recipients, and one or more keys for the signers.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo "Hello, woods!" | sq encrypt --recipient-cert /tmp/bob.pgp --signer-key /tmp/alice.sec &gt; /tmp/msg.pgp
</code></pre><p>Decrypting and verifying the signature is similar:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq decrypt --recipient-key /tmp/bob.sec --signer-cert /tmp/alice.pgp /tmp/msg.pgp
Encrypted using AES with 256-bit key
Compressed using ZIP
Good signature from 4D4D 029F 2206 7039
Hello, woods!
1 good signature.
</code></pre><p>(If you are interested in examining the structure of the message at
the byte level, be sure to try the <code>--hex</code> option.)</p>
<p><code>sq</code> can also fetch keys from key servers:</p>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>Every so often I get asked for advice on how to become an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/">AWS Hero</a>.</p><p>The specific answer isn’t that interesting – “get involved in the community and hope someone nominates you as a Hero” seems to be the process at AWS. I understand that the <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview">Microsoft MVP process</a> is a bit more transparent and better prescribed.</p><p>But the general question of “how do I become well-respected in my chosen technical specialty” is VERY interesting. Even if you don’t have any aspirations to build a public following, there is tremendous career value in becoming the go-to person within your technical niche.</p><p>The person who everybody on your team comes to with their toughest question about that language or framework. The person who knows where all the bodies are buried in ActiveDirectory or Typescript or DynamoDB. Those folks have great careers and job security because authoritative knowledge like that is rare.</p><p>To some extent, it’s rare because wisdom only comes with experience. But I know plenty of engineers who’ve sat in the same chair for ten years getting the same year of experience ten times. Heck, I’ve been there myself; I spent a couple of years as an “accidental DBA” who never really learned that much about SQL Server beyond what the daily firefighting required.</p><p>I used to spend a lot of time wondering how other people seemed to level up so quickly on new technologies. How do you break through that stagnant cycle of learning and forgetting stuff in bits and pieces, using the same technology for years without ever feeling like an expert?</p><p>A few years ago I learned a secret for doing this, a cheat code if you will, from my fellow AWS Hero <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/author/jared-short">Jared Short</a>. This is his secret recipe for leveling up in tech:</p><p><strong>Read the documentation for one job-relevant technology, cover-to-cover, every week. </strong></p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forrest is giving away my secrets, but it's true. I'd estimate around 700+ hours of just reading AWS docs over my career with intent to retain / learn (not just reference). It feels silly until you almost immediately understand some esoteric side-effect or behavior. <a href="https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI">https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI</a></p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347629518312378369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><h2 id="h-reading-docs-the-wrong-way-and-the-right-way">Reading docs: the wrong way and the right way</h2><p>I get it, that doesn’t sound revolutionary. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>” is literally as old as computing itself. It’s the classic kiss-off answer to questions you ought to be able to Google.</p><p>And that betrays a key limitation in how a lot of us think about documentation. We think of it tactically, as a resource to query when we have a specific question or encounter a particular error. We use docs to fill in our <em>known unknowns.</em></p><p>That’s how you can get stuck for years, say, administering a PostgresSQL cluster and never really becoming that deep of an expert on Postgres. If you only learn something new when the situation demands it, your mental model of Postgres (or whatever) will look like a gradually expanding version of this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2181" height="1647" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2181w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1536w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2181px) 100vw, 2181px"></figure><p>Over time, as you encounter more new use cases for the technology, you’ll burn more “never forget” bubbles into the mental model. But you’ll still have this heavy sense of unknown unknowns hanging over you, and you’ll never be sure if you’re really using the optimal approach to solve a new problem.</p><p>Instead, Jared’s approach is to read docs strategically<em>, </em>preemptively, curiously: as a way to fill in your <em>unknown unknowns</em>. The things you might not encounter in ten years, but that would cost you two days of troubleshooting if you ran into them tomorrow.</p><p>Read docs like novels (cover to cover), not like dictionaries (look up the term, cross-reference, and stop). Over time, that strategy will lead to a mental model of your professional domain that looks more like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="727" height="549" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 727w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px"></figure><p>(This is <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/how-many-certifications-do-i-need-to-get-a-cloud-job">the same benefit</a> you get from studying for certifications, by the way: you’re building a mental map of the domain, so you don’t have to stumble through the darkness on every new quest.)</p><p>On the surface, that sounds simple, but it’s far from easy. Here are three common objections people raise when I advise reading docs as a career-advancement strategy:</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-a-photographic-memory-i-ll-never-remember-a-bunch-of-random-docs"><strong>“I don’t have a photographic memory. I’ll never remember a bunch of random docs.”</strong></h4><p>Back when I was in college, a well-meaning friend convinced me I should read a book on SAP. Forget today — I couldn’t have told you a single thing about SAP <em>ten minutes after finishing that book</em>. I’d never been inside an enterprise, much less understood the problems these ERP integrations I was reading about were supposed to solve. It was like trying to talk to the aliens in the movie <em>Arrival</em>: my brain was the wrong shape.</p><p>Likewise, you probably won’t get much value out of glancing through docs for a technology you don’t use and have no context for.</p><p>So do these two things:</p><p>1. <strong>Focus on docs for technologies you are already using</strong>. We’ve all had that mind-numbing feeling when plowing through some esoteric text that doesn’t relate to our daily lives, where you glaze over for three pages and then go, “what did I just read?”</p><p>Avoid this by focusing on docs for technologies or languages you’ve already got a vested stake in – say, because they’re on your plate at work or you’re trying to build them into a side project.</p><p>Encourage active reading and engagement with the information by asking yourself questions like these as you read:</p><ul id="block-ef7bb5e0-252c-434f-98de-116c8c0e2003"><li>Did I understand that? (If not, maybe read the section again)</li><li>Does what I just read match my existing mental model of how this technology works? (If not, do I need to go review a different doc and then come back to this?)</li><li>Could this feature or fact help me on my current project?</li><li>If I had known this six months ago, what would I have done differently? (“Chosen a different technology” is a totally acceptable answer!)</li></ul><p>Then, <strong>2. Read those docs repeatedly, on a schedule, over and over</strong>. Seriously. If you’re on a team that’s building out centralized CI/CD for Azure, maybe read the part of the Azure DevOps docs on pipelines this week and the part on build agents next week, and when you get to the end, start over. The cloud changes fast. You’ll fold in new information at the same time you’re reinforcing the old.</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-time-to-read-a-bunch-of-documentation"><strong>“I don’t have time to read a bunch of documentation.”</strong></h4><p>Yes, and weeks of work can save you hours of planning. Maybe use some of the time you currently spend injecting “HERE” print statements into your code to figure out why it’s not working.</p><figure><img src="https://faasandfurious.com/pages/debugging-tactics.png" alt="Debugging Tactics"></figure><p>More seriously, it’s not a bad idea to block a bit of time on your calendar each day – 30 minutes, even –  for targeted doc-reading. You may find it hard to carve that time out of your workday, but defending time and setting expectations with your manager is its own skill, worth practicing. Call the block of time “deep work.” It is.</p><h4 id="h-the-docs-for-technology-x-are-no-good-trust-me-they-re-not-worth-reading"><strong>“The docs for [technology X] are no good. Trust me, they’re not worth reading.”</strong></h4><p>I don’t always buy this excuse. The docs might not be that bad; you might just have the wrong expectations.</p><p>For example, the AWS documentation gets <a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1347737875991777280">a terrible rap</a> for being wordy and poorly-organized. And it’s maybe even worse than you’ve heard – if you’re trying to look up the name of an IAM action or the syntax of a CLI command, that is.</p><p>But as an educational tool that dives deep on the architectural underpinnings and technical limitations of services, the AWS docs are <em>fantastic. </em>They’re better than any book you could ever buy about the cloud. (And the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Builder’s Library</a> is better still.) The AWS docs are designed not just to be referenced, but to be read. Read ’em!</p><p>On the other hand, some types of docs like step-by-step tutorials are very much designed to be referenced during hands-on builder time. It may not make sense to spend a lot of time reading those in the abstract. So bring your common sense.</p><p>However. There are also plenty of technologies out there where the docs are truly incomplete, out of date, or just plain wrong – many smaller open-source projects, in particular.</p><p>Turns out you have another option here, at least for OSS projects: <em>read the source code.</em> Not sure what a module does, what its edge cases are, what the error code means? Read the source code and find out! It might be faster than (and will definitely be at least as accurate as) looking for the answer in the docs, <em>even if the docs are pretty good. </em></p><p>If you write code for a living, reading other people’s shipped, battle-tested code — not just PRs from your own team — is genuinely one of the most transformative things you can do for your career. Because while you’re answering your immediate question, you’ll also be picking up style, organization, and technique from professional programmers operating under all kinds of interesting constraints. Seriously. Read code.</p><p>(And then, if it’s open-source, maybe consider contributing some docs!)</p><h2 id="h-what-do-i-get-out-of-all-this"><strong>What do I get out of all this?</strong></h2><p>If you read a targeted set of docs consistently over a sustained period — say, a couple of years — while actively practicing on that technology, you will be able to perform magic. That’s a promise.</p><p>Let’s go back to Jared Short again for an example. (Yes, I checked with Jared, he graciously agreed to let me spill his secrets in this piece.) As an engineer at an AWS shop, Jared …</p><ul><li>Reads the documentation for one AWS service, cover to cover, every week.</li><li>Blocks daily time for this on his calendar.</li><li>Focuses on services he’s actually using at work (he tells me that so far in 2021, he’s been through all the docs for Lambda, AppSync, and Step Functions).</li></ul><p>Jared’s been doing this week in, week out, for *years*. And that  unglamorous commitment lets him perform nerd magic like this:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I needed to understand extensions better for a thing, read the docs cover to cover like an insane person.</p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347612782389301249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>If you don’t want to take the time to read that whole Twitter thread, let me sum it up for you.</p><ol><li>An experienced AWS engineer encounters a weird behavior: AWS Lambda seems to be executing code when it should not be. He posts a plea for help on Twitter.</li><li>Other experienced engineers take a look and go, “huh. Weird.” To be clear, this is not a case of RTFM. The problem is nontrivial and the solution, if there is one, is not well-known. …</li></ol></div></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_219370"><div><p>Today a lot of valuable digital construction data (BIM data and beyond) is locked up in closed proprietary data formats which are bound to aging software packages developed by a single software vendor. As a result, stakeholders in the construction process (e.g. contractors, sub-contractors, estimators, specification writers, owners, facility managers, etc.) are unable to fully leverage the BIM data to make better decisions or optimize their processes. Some of the negative results are miscommunication and misunderstanding between stakeholders, inaccurate estimation, change orders, scheduling and planning conflicts, errors in constructability, and so on.</p><p>Two decades ago, it was common practice for data formats to be only read and written by a single piece of software, on a single platform. This is no longer adequate.</p><p>As the internet has grown in importance, and as computing devices have become more specialized, well-designed open data exchange formats such as PDF, HTML, JPEG, MP3, MP4, and XML have become crucial to the effective exchange of data.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_228680"><div><p>So what is an open format, why is it good for the construction industry? First, according to Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p><em>An open format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open formats, closed formats are considered trade secrets.</em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975570419_24188"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Customers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607435564498_23818"><div><p><em>As a customer, it is risky to build a dependency on technology based on a single vendor’s closed format. </em>Users place themselves entirely at the mercy of one business: their pricing, tooling, and support. This has proven to be a real problem for customers that have their data locked up behind a walled garden that they must pay exorbitant amounts of money to have limited access to it.</p><p>This is a relic of an older business model from the time when most computing was done in isolation on a single machine. This model is extremely outdated. </p><p>Customers expect to be able to have contextual views of the same data across different platforms with varying capabilities.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975833465_16265"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Businesses</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975950758_13055"><div><p>Technology that is open is better.

It has become the default asset transmission format in the games industry. Even though FBX has a free SDK, it is not open format. Reading and writing FBX files requires the binary SDK and it cannot be ported to web-browsers. FBX was originally designed for animation data. It does not do a good job of conveying the semantics of BIM data and is inefficient at handling large geometry.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976375619_14778"><p><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0"><strong>glTF</strong></a><strong> (GL Transmission Format)</strong> is an open data exchange format for 3D geometry and animation data that was designed specifically for WebGL.

This means that to make a rendering, the parametric surfaces and solids must go through a very lengthy conversion process into a triangular representation appropriate for rendering by the GPU (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphical Processing Unit</a>). The GPU specializes in drawing lists of triangles very quickly. The conversion of a parametric surface to a triangular format is called “triangulation” or “tessellation”.</p><p>The process of triangulating complex intersecting parametric surfaces is very time consuming for a computer, and hard to do correctly. It requires a specialized library, called a geometry kernel. With the goal of reducing the time required to display the geometry, this made IFC unacceptably inefficient for us.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976621178_36617"><p><h3>Our Findings Left Us Searching for More Answers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976943187_17825"><p>We found that these formats required too much complexity to parse large scale BIM projects correctly and efficiently on low-power devices, and they had no built-in mechanism to carry the structured BIM data.

            <div data-animation-name="slideInUp">
              <p>As a startup or small business, your product is important. Probably the most essential asset for your company. A good product means that you get to sell, make money, and keep existing. With this in mind, itâ€™s understandable to want to build the perfect product. But what if thatâ€™s not the answer? History is full of examples of companies that launched what they thought was the perfect product and watched it fail in slow motion. What if I told you that the solution isnâ€™t to try building the perfect product but to start with a shitty one.</p>

<h2>What Defines a Good Product?</h2>
<p>Before we go on, letâ€™s define what a good product is. Simply put, itâ€™s what your customers are willing to buy because it solves a problem. When itâ€™s really good, customers tell their friends and family all  about it.  In the words of Clayton Christensen, they're hiring that â€˜productâ€™ (or service) to get a job done.</p>

<p>Think of it like this. When your kitchen pipes are clogged, you hire a plumber. If you're hungry, you hire a pizza. Need to move around? Hire an Uber. Building a good product means that it solves your customer's problems so well that they're happy with the purchase.</p>

<p>If this is what a good product is, then why would you ever build a shitty one? Because itâ€™s very rare — almost impossible even — that youâ€™ll develop the perfect product right out of the gate.</p>

<p>You need to start somewhere. And thatâ€™s often with a <strong>less-than-optimal product.</strong> You need this at first to <strong>figure out what your customers really want.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, you're looking for a product-market fit.</p>

<h2>Finding Product-Market-Fit</h2>
<p>When we talk about a shitty product, we don't mean you should intentionally build a bad one. Just don't strive for perfection yet, especially if you're unsure who your customers are and what they want.  Your customers are the final arbitrators of how good your product is, so your focus at every stage of developing the product is to find out if they want what youâ€™re building. This is what a product-market fit is all about.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-market-fit/" target="_blank">According to Marc Andreesen</a>, an entrepreneur and investor credited with developing the concept, said product-market fit means finding a good market and a solution good enough to satisfy that market. With a good product-market fit, your target customers are buying your solution, using it, and talking about it to other people on a large enough scale to sustain the companyâ€™s growth and profitability.</p>

<p>To find a good product-market fit, youâ€™ve got to find out what your market wants and ensure that the product contains that. This is where the shitty product comes in.</p>

<p>Building a perfect product is expensive and time-consuming. Unfortunately, if your product doesn't fit the market or vice versa, then all that time and money will be wasted. When building something new, your first goal isn't to create a perfect product; itâ€™s to figure out what your market is and what potential buyers want. When you figure this part out, you can then channel your energy to perfecting the product.</p>

<h3>Start with an MVP</h3>
<p>No, not the best player on the sports team. Here, MVP means Minimum Viable Product -- the smallest and cheapest version of your product that you can produce to find out if you have a good product-market fit. Itâ€™s essentially your â€˜shittyâ€™ product. Think about it like this, the goal of your MVP is to find out with the first version if thereâ€™s a viable market for it. If there is, then you can work on improving the MVP to make a stronger offering.</p>

<p>Take the example of the Ford Edsel. It failed so badly that the word â€œEdselâ€� on Dictionary.com has a slang definition of â€œSomething useless; a fiasco.â€� <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/03/AR2007090301419_5.html" target="_blank">Ford launched the Edsel</a> in 1957, and they were designed to be flashy rather than practical. After praising the cars for months, Ford unveiled the new line of Edsels on-E-day.â€™ Almost 3 million people visited showrooms, but only 64,000 units were sold. The line was finally killed in 1959, costing Ford almost $2 billion in losses. Thatâ€™ll be worth over $17 billion today.</p>

<p>Among all the other factors contributing to the lineâ€™s failure, spending so much time to develop a perfect car without any validation from the market was perhaps the biggest. They obviously didnâ€™t understand what their market wanted, and it cost them badly.</p>

<p>When building your product or service, especially as a small company or startup, you must build with your market in mind. That is, build what you <strong>know</strong> your market wants, not what you <strong>think</strong> they want. Assumptions can be deadly. And in the age of customer centricity, go ahead and let your customers tell you exactly what they want.</p>

<h2>Learn Fast, Build Often</h2>
<p>When you build your MVP, your goal is to get it in front of your target audience. You need to learn from early customers, beta testers and really anyone willing to give you feedback. There are few questions you need to ask.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is the problem my product solves a real market need?:</strong> This is perhaps the most critical question that has to be answered. If you donâ€™t solve a real problem,  it doesnâ€™t matter how good your product is; the chances of finding a product-market fit is practically non-existent. For a product-market fit to exist, you need a problem that enough people have and are willing to â€™hireâ€™ your product to solve.</li>
<li><strong>Is the product creating new problems:</strong> Sometimes, your product is good, and solves a market need, but in the process unintentionally creates a new problem. This is why itâ€™s critical to test out your MVP with a small group of people that fit your target market. By watching them interact with your product, youâ€™ll learn what is good, what needs improvement and most importantly, how to improve it. Direct customer feedback is invaluable, so take full advantage when you can get it. And understand that and there will almost always be problems with your MVP. Thatâ€™s part of the whole â€˜shittyâ€™ approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>As big as Google is, they once failed to do this, which cost them dearly. Google unveiled Glass in 2012. It was the tech leaderâ€™s first attempt at wearable technology. However, the software had many bugs, health, and safety concerns, and there just werenâ€™t many practical uses for it. Much more than that, Google failed to position the product properly. When they launched, t, it was just a prototype, not a finished product. They spend way too much time â€˜perfectingâ€™ it rather than getting an MVP out there quickly to get customer feedback.</p>

<p>Worse yet, Google didnâ€™t even seriously seek feedback at all. Astro Teller, the director of the Google X research Lab, told <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8235277/sxsw-astro-teller-google-x" target="_blank">The Verge in an interview</a> that they marketed Glass as a finished product.</p>

<p>As part of the Explorer program, Google released Glass to tech enthusiasts and journalists with a $1500 price tag for early access. However, because the product wasnâ€™t ready, many trashed the product, writing articles like: â€œ<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nobody-really-likes-google-glass-2013-5" target="_blank">Nobody Likes Google Glass</a>,â€� and even invented the term â€œ<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/07/14/is-google-glass-cool-or-just-plain-creepy/" target="_blank">Glassholes</a>.â€�</p>

<p>By not building an MVP or a shitty product that could be tested privately, Google Glass failed horribly. By January of 2015, Google stopped selling Glass and had to end itâ€™s explorer program.</p>

<p><strong>Learn from the best and avoid the pitfalls of Ford and Google.</strong></p>

<p>When building your product, Your first goal shouldnâ€™t be to make a perfect product. Itâ€™s to make sure thereâ€™s enough market demand and a good fit for it. And thatâ€™s why you need to start with a less-than-perfect and well,  â€˜shittyâ€™ product. Not in the sense that you are trying to fail. Ideally, you want to be as close to perfect as possible, even in the early stage. But donâ€™t waste valuable development cycles fine-tuning your offering until you validate with customers that they actually want it.</p>

<p>A great example of a company that started with a â€˜shittyâ€™ product is Zappos. They were one of the first online retailers, and now sell everything fashion, from boots, to bags. When they started in 1999, Nick Swinmurm, the founder, wasn't sure if people were ready to buy shoes online. He could have invested thousands of dollars in buying stock, building a distribution network to see if the business model worked, but he took a different approach.</p>

<p>He went to local stores, took pictures of their inventory, and then posted the pictures on a basic website. That was their MVP. A shitty website and some photos. If there was an order, heâ€™d go buy the shoes from the retailer and send them to the customers.</p>

<p>The success of this proved that there was demand for the product, and achieved product-market fit. The rest is history, as Zappos eventually grew into the billion dollar empire it is today on the model of selling shoes online.</p>

<p>In conclusion, when building your product, your main goal should be to find out if your audience wants your product. Figure this out as cheaply and as fast as possible. When you achieve product-market fit, you can then worry about building the perfect product. At least, you know that thereâ€™s someone ready to buy it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is trending. But the remote revolution started long before the pandemic and will stay powerful even after the hype subsides. As with any change, how well you adapt and improve will determine whether you get the better of remote work or run back to offices once the external factors go away.</p> <p>I decided to go remote 3 years ago and I'm glad I did. My last workplace was BriteCore, a remote-first company based in the US. And tomorrow, I'll be joining Doist, a pioneer in the world of remote work. I have gone through a lot of interview processes in the recent years.</p> <p>This article is an attempt to answer the why, what and how of remote work. The intended primary audience are developers from developing countries like me (I'm from Bangladesh) who do not want to relocate right now but wants to work on exciting products and teams all over the world. The general ideas apply to all professions that can be carried out remotely and to professionals anywhere in the world.</p> <h2 id="why-remote"> Why Remote</h2> <h3 id="better-opportunities"> Better Opportunities</h3> <p>Going remote means your employment is not limited to your physical location anymore. That opens up a world of opportunities. You can work for your dream company or with the colleagues and experts that you cherish. And all of it while staying in the place you like with the people you love. If you are the nomad type, this gives you great flexibility.</p> <h3 id="better-financial-gain"> Better Financial Gain</h3> <p>💵 Remote work opens up much better opportunities with much better compensations if you're, like me, living in a developing country. The compensations are generally much better than the local industry.</p> <p>📈 The high exchange rates between the powerful currencies and the local ones allow you to leverage the asymmetry and save much more. In fact, you can end up with a higher net savings per month than someone earning more than you in expensive places like San Francisco or London for example.</p> <p>📉 Tax rates are also generally lower and most developing countries have generous rebates if you're bringing in foreign remittance.</p> <p>✅ Even if you're living in a developed country, remote work saves you a good amount from commute, lunch and everything in between that comes with showing up in an office.</p> <h3 id="better-self-actualization"> Better Self-actualization</h3> <p>Remote work allows you to do deep work and puts you in control of your routine and interruptions. In a world of constant connectivity, the option to go deep as needed can give you an unfair advantage in knowledge based work that reward craftsmanship and superior skills. Read the interesting book titled <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> to learn more about this.</p> <h2 id="the-remote-skillset"> The Remote Skillset</h2> <p>Remote work comes with its share of challenges. You need to adapt and overcome these challenges to thrive in a remote work environment for the long term. And the process starts with adopting the remote skillset.</p> <p>I use a handy mnemonic  to summarise the skillset essential for remote work. I call it the <strong>IBM CI</strong>. IBM, as you probably know, is the name of a famous company and CI or <em>Continuous Integration</em> is a term developers are quite familiar with.</p> <p>The mnemonic comes from <strong>I</strong>ndependence, <strong>B</strong>alance, <strong>M</strong>astery, <strong>C</strong>ommunication and <strong>I</strong>mpact. I borrowed it from <a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a>. So, all credit goes to the awesome team there. I just came up with the mnemonic to remember it better. You can find it in any of their job descriptions. Their <a href="https://blog.doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> is chalk-full of great articles on remote work. Subscribe to the blog to get the best out of it.</p> <p>I'll only touch on two aspects that encompass everything else.</p> <p><strong>Manager of One</strong>: Going remote means you're unlikely to have colleagues by your side. If you're working from home, it can be quite a challenge to put a boundary between work and non-work time. You're in charge of yourself and your schedule. So, you need to be able to do it well if you want to succeed in remote work in the long term.</p> <p>I borrowed the term <em>Manager of One</em> from Basecamp, a pioneer and advocate of remote work. The ability to manage yourself is pivotal to a successful remote career. Read more about it on Basecamp's <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Bulk of the communication in remote work happens in the written medium. You need to harness your ability to express your thoughts and ideas clearly in the written form to thrive in a remote setting. This is also going to be the primary mode of making connections with colleagues across the company. You don't need to become a literary genius though. Clear and concise technical writing goes a long way. <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1208930197702995968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This tweet </a>sums up a  lot of great points.</p> <p>The tone gets lost in transmission in written medium. It's always good to pay extra attention to not come off harsh. Warm your messages with emojis 😃</p> <p>Most remote settings will have a diverse workforce. It's important that you stay sensitive to cultural diversities and refrain from saying anything that may be acceptable in your culture but not in others. Avoid using swear or curse words in all settings even if you deem it to be informal. I have had a manager in the past who would use the f-word in meetings. Please don't!</p> <p>As for technical skills, I advice to work on-site when starting out if possible. Most remote jobs expect you to do your job with minimal supervision. It's easier to find jobs and perform better when you have some experience under your belt.</p>  <p>Remote work means managing yourself well. Most of your communication will happen online and it is expected that you'll be using a lot of collaboration tools. Here are some of my suggestions to organise yourself better and produce quality output.</p> <p>📝 Use a task management tool. Put all your tasks as they pop up in your list and plan them accordingly. I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todoist</a> for this but any tool that you're comfortable with works, even pen and paper.</p> <p>📓 Use an app for writing and taking notes. I prefer <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iA writer</a> for long documents and <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a> for quick notes synced across devices. But again, anything that you're comfortable with works fine.</p> <p>🛠 Familiarise yourself with communication tools like Slack, Teams, etc if not already. Most companies use one for communication. While there's not much of a learning curve, you should at least know that they exist. Same for project management tools like Jira, Trello and so on.</p> <h2 id="shades-of-remote"> Shades of Remote</h2> <p>This section is more focused on developer jobs. Remote work can mean a lot of things for a developer. It can be consulting, freelancing, working for steady clients or full time contracts with companies. I'll categorise them in 3 buckets and list some resources where you can find opportunities for that category.</p> <h3 id="freelancing-platforms"> Freelancing Platforms</h3> <p>You can freelance on projects remotely on freelancing platforms. Examples include Upwork, Freelancer, etc where you can join, create a profile and start bidding on projects.</p> <p>While this is a good option to work on projects you're interested in, I tend to prefer not working on them as a career choice. All clients are not the same, so it needs a lot of calibration every time you start a new project.</p> <p>Clients generally choose these platforms for cost optimisation. So, the engineering standards are generally a bit lower and the deadline pressures are more intense.</p> <p>This also means variable workload and variable income, which makes planning your time and life harder. But I have worked on projects intermittently on Upwork before and it can be a good path to pursue if it suits you.</p> <p>Here's a list of popular freelancing platforms:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwork</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freelancer</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.guru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guru</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peopleperhour</a></li></ul> <h3 id="agency-platforms"> Agency Platforms</h3> <p>Some platforms employ a vetting process and only allow successful candidates on their platforms. For the lack of a better word, I call them agency platforms. These platforms are on the rise and I see new ones every now and then.</p> <p>Once you're on the platform, you may have to bid for projects again or you may be paired with companies depending on the type of the platform. But you'll be working as a member of the platform and the platform will take a cut off your earnings.</p> <p>One major downside of both these types of platforms is that you don't get any paid time offs (PTO). If you don't work, you don't get paid. You don't get any other perks or benefits either. But once you get yourself on these platforms, it may be easier to land clients or contracts (and better ones) than on platforms mentioned in the first category. Remember to check reviews before joining. Do not join if you don't like their practices.</p> <p>Here's a list of some platforms in this category:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toptal</a></li> <li><a href="https://x-team.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Team</a></li> <li><a href="https://turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a></li> <li><a href="https://triplebyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripleByte</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.vettery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vettery</a></li> <li><a href="https://6nomads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6nomads</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.crossover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossover</a></li></ul> <p>This list is not exhaustive and there's a lot of other platforms like these. I haven't worked on any of these, so do your review before you decide to join.</p> <h3 id="remote-companies"> Remote Companies</h3> <p>Remote-first or full-remote companies fall in this category. The number of such companies is increasing rapidly, thanks to the pandemic. You can apply to these companies directly from their job posts and work as independent contractors after you successfully complete their recruitment process.</p> <p>I prefer this category of remote work because you get to work for the company directly. Generally, the teams and cultures are better in companies who hire directly.</p> <p>Similarly, the compensations and benefits are better as well. Most of them will provide PTOs and have good practices around remote work.</p> <p>Some popular companies that hire remotely are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a></li> <li><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapier</a></li> <li><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a></li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab</a></li> <li><a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automattic</a></li> <li><a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a></li></ul> <p>There are many job forums and aggregate websites that you can subscribe to for job openings in remote companies. You can create email subscriptions according to your choices. Here's a list of some popular remote job forums:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Work Remotely</a></li> <li><a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelList</a></li> <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?r=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack OverFlow jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/remote-jobs-SRCH_KO0,6.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Door Jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotecircle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteCircle</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Remote Jobs Forum</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotive.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remotive</a></li> <li><a href="https://jobs.underpin.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Underpin</a></li> <li><a href="https://remote.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote.co</a></li> <li><a href="http://remote4me.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote4Me</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn jobs</a></li> <li><a href="http://remotepython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Python</a></li></ul> <p>These platforms are great for job search.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><span>In today's era of drip campaigns and automated sales message, a well-crafted cold email stands head and shoulders above its competition. The only way to write a great cold email is to be authentic and maybe even a little bit weird. In his recent book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Selling-Principles-Sales-Everyday/dp/1735956902/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Authentic Selling: How To Use The Principles of Sales in Everyday Life</span></a><span>, Jeff Kirchick lays the framework for the perfect cold email. For those of us who haven’t spent the past fifteen years in a sales role, the thought of sending cold emails can be scary. Hopefully the except from </span><span>Authentic Selling</span><span> will ease some of those nerves.</span></em></p>

<p><b>Authentic &amp; Eccentric Cold Outreach</b></p>

<p><span>People are weird. All of us are eccentric in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing I tell inside salespeople when I hire them is that I want them to embrace themselves and everything that makes them authentically weird. The weirder they are, the better. And whether or not you like my theory on weirdness, it is absolutely true today that most buyers are inundated with emails, many of which come from salespeople, vying for their attention. What this means is that you need to stand out from the pack. Hence, the weirder you are, the better. Even though Waldo was dressed in strange red and white attire, he was always hard to spot in those “Where’s Waldo?” books because he wasn’t weird enough to really stand out from the pack. And Waldo looked like a pretty weird guy. You need to be weirder than Waldo.</span></p>
<p><span>I compartmentalize a good sales email into three parts: The Excuse, The Value Proposition, and The Ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What does this mean in the real world? It means that when I write a subject line for my e-mail, the goal is to get the person to open the e-mail. It is not to get that person to buy my product. It is simply to get them to open the message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some better examples of subject lines that are hard to ignore:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“Hello from a fellow alumnus of X University”</span></p>
<p><span>“Hello from a fan of [buyer’s product company name]”</span></p>
<p><span>“Fellow Boston Bruins fan looking to connect”</span></p>
<p><span>Or, perhaps for a Star Wars fan, “Read or read not, there is no try”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>You get the picture. You are using something appealing to your target to establish some mutual synergy. And from there, the goal remains the same. The goal of the first sentence is to get the reader to the second sentence. The goal of the second sentence is to get the reader to the third sentence. The goal of each and every word is to get the reader to the next word. And eventually, as you will soon see, the ultimate goal at the end is to have mutual agreement to meet together. But it is only the sum of the parts – the e-mail in its entirety – which should convince the reader that this is a worthy outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>None of this can be accomplished if you are writing an essay to the client. Most people feel out whether or not they have the time to read an email by staring at its sheer size once they open it. If the email is too long, it is likely to get deleted, even if the email itself is some of the finest prose ever known to mankind. This is really no different than how you would approach the proverbial stranger at the bar. If you went up to them and told them your life story, they are likely to be a little creeped out. But, if you led off with something short and sweet about a commonality, it leaves the door open for curiosity that can spark a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>Without further ado, let’s start to dive into the structure of sound cold outreach.</span></p>

<p><b>Part 1: The Excuse</b></p>
<p><span>I call the first part of cold outreach “the excuse” because you are always interrupting someone’s day, and when you interrupt someone’s day, you better have a good excuse. You would never walk up to someone, for example, who is clearly on a phone call, and ask them for directions. If you did, you would at least preface your statement with a good excuse: “Hey, I know you look really busy but this is kind of an emergency so I hope you don’t mind me interrupting you to ask a quick question?” Anything short of that and the person who you are calling upon for help is likely to leave with a bad taste in their mouth over your poor manners, and this makes them all the more likely to decline helping you or to provide you with bad directions. No one wins in that situation.</span></p>
<p><span>The excuse for reaching out to someone should always be something personal. Most sales training programs miss this, encouraging the sales rep to open up with some sort of before and after scenario. This could be something about how bad life is today in the absence of the product that is being sold, and what life looks like after, followed by examples of satisfied customers and some statistics to substantiate the point. While none of this is objectively wrong to do, per se, it is also what pretty much everyone else is doing. And if you are fighting for someone’s attention and every single vendor is promising them a better outcome, ultimately it all just starts to sound like white noise.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some examples of successful outreach I have performed.</span></p>
<p><span>I found someone who, like me, was an English major in college. She happened to go to The University of North Carolina. Anyone who goes to UNC hates Duke University as they are bitter in-state sports rivals. As a fellow English major myself, I penned an email to this prospect with the subject line “Hello from a fellow English major and Duke hater.” I opened the email by lamenting how everyone told me I would never get a job out of college with my useless English degree and how it was serendipitous for us to find ourselves linking up in the world, both gainfully employed, with me trying to sell her my product. I went on to talk about how we must also have a mutual disdain for Duke. Let’s face it, Duke resembles the New England Patriots in many ways, in that everyone who is not a fan of either team generally has a lot of ill-will toward their fanbases. And this is coming from a diehard Patriots fan. It’s just reality.</span></p>
<p><span>The prospect I was writing to wrote back to me saying that the email was clever and that she was interested in connecting with me. Meanwhile, I had only spent one or two sentences in the email getting to the meat and potatoes of what we were even selling – and even then, I left it all in high-level terminology. The point being, it did not really matter exactly “what” it was that I was selling – it was the “why” that is always more compelling. And in this case, the “why” was this commonality we had developed which might lead to some building of trust. From a point of trust, no matter what you are buying, you can at least assume that the seller is going to do everything they can to make sure you are successful. Here is the actual email:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>Hey [Prospect],</span></p>
<p><span>Couple things...</span></p>
<p><span>1. Real happy to see a fellow English major thriving in the workforce! They always told me my degree wouldn't be worth much unless I became a teacher, turns out I am saving lives one at a time by selling fraud prevention and call authentication technology.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Duke stinks so it's great you did all of this at UNC.</span></p>
<p><span>In all seriousness, you look like the person who would vet technology for authenticating inbound callers. I know you guys do some stuff with [our competitor], but we would love to have an opportunity to show how we could augment those efforts. Let me know if you would be open to connecting sometime.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers,</span></p>
<p><span>Jeff</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>There is something important I want to call out about this. Nowhere in this email did I compromise my authenticity. I really was an English major in college, I really do enjoy meeting people who shared my major, I genuinely do enjoy joking about us both being gainfully employed, and I also authentically hate Duke (N.B. – apologies to any Duke alumni/alumnae reading this). So nowhere did I sell my soul by writing this message. And this is the thing that is so hard for people to realize in today’s politically-charged climate: you have so much more in common with most people than you would think. If you could only spend a little bit of time peeling the onion, chances are that you would have so much to talk about and agree on if you could get over the obvious differences you see at surface level. It is just a matter of finding out what those commonalities are so you can exploit them and turn them into a positive for both sides. Remember when we talked about empathy a couple chapters ago? You’re going to need that to be able to get far enough with people to realize what values you share. It is those who lack empathy and write other people off entirely that do not even give themselves (and others) an opportunity to see what values they share.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another example of a good excuse to reach out to someone is based on content that they have written. I once uncovered the personal blog of a prospect of mine called “The Traveling Parent.” The blog was basically about how this man balanced his work life with his home life. As you can guess by the title of the blog, he traveled a lot for work and rarely saw his children. He had to get creative about using technology to stay in touch with them, and when he was at home, he needed to set certain boundaries in order to maximize his time with his children. I was actually personally touched while reading his blog. And even though I am not a parent, I do travel quite a bit for work and I could really empathize with his struggle through my own personal experiences of feeling homesick whenever I would hit the road for a new destination. I wrote him a message saying as much after dozens of failed attempts to connect with him previously, and surely enough, he wrote back to me with an interest in meeting. In this scenario, it was by making myself vulnerable that I showed him my humanity, and he responded in kind.</span></p>
<p><span>Content that people write is ripe for good, genuine connections. A personal blog is one thing, but oftentimes people are also writing professionally about subject matter that is relevant to their work, or even for volunteer work that they do in their personal time. For example, I am a volunteer in the Big …</span></p></div></div>

January 26, 2021 | https://blog.melski.net/2010/11/30/makefile-hacks-print-the-value-of-any-variable/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.melski.net/2010/11/30/makefile-hacks-print-the-value-of-any-variable/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div>
					
					<!-- .entry-header -->

											<div>
							<p>One of my favorite makefile debugging tricks is this rule for printing out the value of a variable:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
        @echo '$*=$($*)'</span></pre>
<p>
Throw this into a GNU make makefile and then print any <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable you like by invoking targets like <span><span face="Courier New">print-MAKE_VERSION</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ gmake print-MAKE_VERSION
MAKE_VERSION=3.81</span></pre>
<p>
You can imagine how handy this is when diagnosing issues with your makefiles.  Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> defines a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules"><i>pattern rule</i></a> that matches any target that starts with the characters <span><span face="Courier New">print-</span></span>.</li>
<li>In the context of a pattern rule, the <span><span face="Courier New">$*</span></span> variable expands to the <i>stem</i> of the target, that part which matched the <span><span face="Courier New">%</span></span> in the pattern.  In my example above, that corresponds to <i>MAKE_VERSION</i>.</li>
<li>GNU make variable expansion rules allow for variable references <i>inside</i> variable names, so <span><span face="Courier New">$($*)</span></span> expands first to <span><span face="Courier New">$(MAKE_VERSION)</span></span>, and finally to the value of the <span><span face="Courier New">MAKE_VERSION</span></span> variable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Makefile injection with <span face="Courier New">-f</span></h3>
<p>
The <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule is a slick hack, but it’s a nuisance to have to modify a makefile just to use it.  Worse, you might not even be able to modify the makefile.  Fortunately, there’s a solution:  the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option.  You’re probably familiar with it — that’s how you tell gmake to use a different makefile than the default <span><span face="Courier New">Makefile</span></span> when it starts.  For example, if you have a  makefile named <span><span face="Courier New">build.mak</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f build.mak</span></pre>
<p>
What you may not know is that you can use <i>multiple</i> <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> options on the command line.  GNU make will read each file in turn, incorporating the contents of each just as if they were included with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include"><span><span face="Courier New">include</span></span></a> directive.  We can create a simple makefile called <span><span face="Courier New">printvar.mak</span></span> containing nothing but our <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule, then inject it into any makefile we want like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f printvar.mak -f Makefile print-MAKE_VERSION</span></pre>
<h3>A shell script to save typing</h3>
<p>
The combination of the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule and the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option is powerful, but it’s unwieldy — too many characters to type.  The solution is a shell script wrapper:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">#!/bin/bash

filename=""
if [ -f GNUmakefile ] ; then
  filename="GNUmakefile"
elif [ -f makefile ] ; then
  filename="makefile"
elif [ -f Makefile ] ; then
  filename="Makefile"
fi
if [ -n "$filename" ] ; then
  vars=""
  for n in $@ ; do
    vars="$vars print-$n"
  done
  gmake -f $filename -f printvar.mak $vars
else
  echo "No makefile found" 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi</span></pre>
<p>
Save that in a file called <span><span face="Courier New">printvars</span></span> somewhere on your <span><span face="Courier New">PATH</span></span> and you can do things like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c</span></pre>
<h3>Advanced <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable diagnostics</h3>
<p>
Beyond simply printing the value of a variable, GNU make 3.81 has three built-in functions that allow introspection on variables, which you can add to the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule for additional diagnostics.</p>
<p>
First is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Origin-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(origin)</span></span></a> function, which tells you how a variable was defined.  For example, if a variable <span><span face="Courier New">FOO</span></span> was inherited from the environment, <span><span face="Courier New">$(origin FOO)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">environment</span></span>.  Variables defined in a makefile will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">file</span></span>, and so forth.</p>
<p>
Next is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavor-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(flavor)</span></span></a> function, which tells you the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">flavor of the variable</a>, either <span><span face="Courier New">simple</span></span> or <span><span face="Courier New">recursive</span></span>.</p>
<p>
Finally is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Value-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(value)</span></span></a> function, which gives you the <i>unexpanded</i> value of the variable.  For example, if you have variables like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">FOO=123
BAR=$(FOO)</span></pre>
<p>
<span><span face="Courier New">$(value BAR)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">$(FOO)</span></span>, rather than the fully-expanded <span><span face="Courier New">123</span></span> that you might expect.</p>
<p>
With these additions, the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule now looks like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
	@echo '$*=$($*)'
	@echo '  origin = $(origin $*)'
	@echo '  flavor = $(flavor $*)'
	@echo '   value = $(value  $*)'</span></pre>
<p>
And here’s how it looks in action:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
  origin = default
  flavor = simple
   value = 3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c
  origin = default
  flavor = recursive
   value = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c</span></pre>

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In <a href="https://www.chatkitty.com/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-firebase-part-1/">this tutorial series</a>, 
I'll be showing you how to build a functional and secure chat app using the latest React Native 
libraries, including Gifted Chat and the Expo framework, powered by the ChatKitty platform.</p><div>
          <p>So far you learned how to use the <a href="https://gifted.chat/">Gifted Chat</a> React Native library with ChatKitty's 
JavaScript SDK to build a full featured chat screen with real-time messaging functionality into your app, 
adding screens for users to create public channels, discover new channels, and view their channels. 
In <a href="https://www.chatkitty.com/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-expo-part-3/">the third article of this series</a>,
you enhanced that chat experience by implementing in-app and push notifications to notify your users when 
chat events occur. </p>
<p>In this tutorial, you'll be building on the group chat experience you created adding <strong>direct messaging</strong> 
to allow users to communicate privately. You'll also be adding a few enhancements to the chat experience 
including <strong>typing indicators</strong>, and <strong>chat room presence notifications</strong>. </p>
<p>After reading this article, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create direct channels for users to chat privately</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integrate Gifted Chat's in-built typing indicator and implement a custom more detailed indicator</p>
</li>
<li><p>Notify chat users when a user enters or leaves the chat from a chat screen</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow users to leave chat channels they are no longer interested in</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you followed along the previous articles, you should already have the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatkitty">ChatKitty JavaScript SDK NPM package</a> 
added to your Expo React Native project. To make sure you have the latest version of ChatKitty, run the 
yarn upgrade command:</p>
<pre><code># upgrade ChatKitty SDK to the latest version
yarn upgrade chatkitty</code></pre>


<p>Before we begin, let's go over some terms we'll be using a lot in this article.</p>
<h2 id="direct-channels">Direct channels</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.chatkitty.com/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-2/">Previously, we learned about ChatKitty chat channels</a>,
specifically <strong>public channels</strong> that users can discover and join, or be invited to join. <strong>Direct channels</strong>, 
on the other hand, let users have private conversations between up to 9 other users. New users cannot be added to a direct 
channel and there can only exist one direct channel between a set of users. Direct channels are perfect 
for one-off conversations that don't require an entire channel to discuss.</p>
<h2 id="entering-a-chat">Entering a chat</h2>
<p>When a user starts a chat session and has no other active chat sessions in the session channel, the user 
has <strong>entered a chat</strong>. In other words, users who have entered a chat have <em>at least one active chat session</em> 
for that chat channel, and are <strong>active participants</strong> of the conversation. Active chat participants 
receive real-time messaging events, and are present to reply immediately. </p>
<h2 id="leaving-a-chat">Leaving a chat</h2>
<p>After a user ends a chat session and has no other active chat sessions in the session channel, the user 
has <strong>left a chat</strong>. Users leave a chat when there is <em>no longer at least one active chat session</em> 
for that chat channel, and are <em>no longer active participants</em> of the conversation. After leaving a chat, 
users begin to get notifications of events that happened in the chat while they are away.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-a-channel">Leaving a channel</h2>
<p>After a user joins a channel, the user becomes a channel member. Channel members can send messages in 
a channel, and receives messages and notifications related to the channel. If a user is no longer interested 
in a channel, the user can leave the channel and is no longer a channel member.</p>
<p>Okay, let's get started! 🏎️</p>
<p>First, you'll be adding direct messaging functionality to your chat app.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-direct-messaging-channel">Creating a direct messaging channel</h2>
<p>Edit the <code>ChatScreen.js</code> screen file you previous created to destructure its <code>navigation</code> prop:</p>
<pre><code>export default function ChatScreen({ route, navigation /* Add this */ }) {
  const {user} = useContext(AuthContext);
  const {channel} = route.params;

  // Unchanged
}</code></pre>


<p>Now, you can customize your Gifted Chat message avatar to create or get a direct channel, and navigate 
the user to a new chat screen with the direct channel when it's pressed.</p>
<p>Define a new method <code>renderAvatar</code> to pass into your <code>GiftedChat</code> component:</p>
<pre><code>import { Avatar, Bubble, GiftedChat } from 'react-native-gifted-chat';

// Unchanged

function renderAvatar(props) {
  return (
    &lt;Avatar
      {...props}
      onPressAvatar={(avatarUser) =&gt; {
        kitty
          .createChannel({
            type: 'DIRECT',
            members: [{ id: avatarUser._id }],
          })
          .then((result) =&gt; {
            navigation.navigate('Chat', { channel: result.channel });
          });
      }}
    /&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>


<p>Set the <code>GiftedChat</code> <code>renderAvatar</code> prop to the method you defined:</p>
<pre><code>return (
  &lt;GiftedChat
    messages={messages}
    onSend={handleSend}
    user={mapUser(user)}
    loadEarlier={loadEarlier}
    isLoadingEarlier={isLoadingEarlier}
    onLoadEarlier={handleLoadEarlier}
    renderBubble={renderBubble}
    renderAvatar={renderAvatar} /* Add this */
  /&gt;
);</code></pre>


<p>After these changes, <code>ChatScreen.js</code> should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import React, { useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Avatar, Bubble, GiftedChat } from 'react-native-gifted-chat';

import { kitty } from '../chatkitty';
import Loading from '../components/Loading';
import { AuthContext } from '../navigation/AuthProvider';

export default function ChatScreen({ route, navigation }) {

<p>If you run the app now and go to a public chat screen, you should see:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.chatkitty.com/images/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-4/screenshot-public-chat.png" alt="Screenshot: Public chat"></p>
<p>Tapping a message avatar should take you to a new chat screen where you can have a direct private conversation.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.chatkitty.com/images/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-4/screenshot-direct-chat.png" alt="Screenshot: Direct chat"></p>
<p>ChatKitty automatically creates a unique channel name for direct channels, so we see a UUID in the app 
title bar. Let's use a more appropriate name for the chat screen title.  </p>
<p>Add a helper method <code>getChannelDisplayName</code> to the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src/chatkitty</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>export function getChannelDisplayName(channel) {
  if (channel.type === 'DIRECT') {
    return channel.members.map((member) =&gt; member.displayName).join(', ');
  } else {
    return channel.name;
  }
}</code></pre>


<p>After this change, <code>index.js</code> should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import ChatKitty from 'chatkitty';

export const kitty = ChatKitty.getInstance('YOUR CHATKITTY API KEY HERE');

export function getChannelDisplayName(channel) {
  if (channel.type === 'DIRECT') {
    return channel.members.map((member) =&gt; member.displayName).join(', ');
  } else {
    return channel.name;
  }
}</code></pre>


<p>You can now update your app to use a more readable channel display name.</p>
<p>Update <code>HomeStack.js</code> in <code>src/navigation</code> to use the <code>getChannelDisplayName</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>import { getChannelDisplayName, kitty } from '../chatkitty';

// Unchanged

&lt;ChatStack.Screen
    name="Chat"
    component={ChatScreen}
    options={({ route }) =&gt; ({
      title: getChannelDisplayName(route.params.channel), /* Add this */
    })}
/&gt;</code></pre>


<p>Also update <code>BrowseChannelsScreen.js</code> and <code>HomeScreen.js</code> in <code>src/screens</code> to use the helper method:</p>
<pre><code>import { getChannelDisplayName, kitty } from '../chatkitty';

// Unchanged

&lt;List.Item
    title={getChannelDisplayName(item)} /* Add this */
    // Unchanged
/&gt;</code></pre>


<p>Running the app now shows the display names of a direct channel's members in the title bar</p>
<p><img src="https://www.chatkitty.com/images/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-4/screenshot-direct-chat-name.png" alt="Screenshot: Direct chat name"></p>
<p>Great! Now you can privately chat with other channel members. Now let's move on to enhancing your chat 
app's experience with a typing indicator.</p>

January 26, 2021 | https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/react-as-generator-engine | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/react-as-generator-engine">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/react-as-generator-engine.webp" alt="Post cover image"><p>React permanently changed the way how developers write web-apps. Personally, we love React and knew it would solve many pain points we faced with Nunjucks. Therefore in the last <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/shape-up-process/issues/1">cycle</a> we integrated it as a template rendering engine into our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a>. This post is a short introduction for developers who write or plan to write templates for AsyncAPI specification using React. It also includes a comparison with the default Nunjucks renderer.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Your React template requires <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk</a> as a dependency. You need it to access the <strong>File</strong> component required as a root component responsible for rendering a file. Furthermore, it provides some common components to make your development easier, like <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>Indent</strong>.	</p><p>Let's consider a basic React template file as the one below called <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>:</p><p>The exported default function returns the <strong>File</strong> component as a root component that the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> uses to figure out what file it should generate. In the example above, we overwrite the default functionality of saving the file as <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>, and we set <strong>asyncapi.md</strong> as the filename. Using the <strong>Text</strong> component, we specify what content should be rendered inside the file. The content of the resulting file is: <code>Some text that should render as is\n</code>. Notice the <strong>\n</strong> character at the end. It is automatically added after the <strong>Text</strong> component.</p><blockquote><p>For further information about components and their props, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">Generator React SDK</a>.	 </p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> doesn't use React renderer by default. You need to specify in the template configuration that your template is based on React. For that, change the <strong>renderer</strong> field of <strong>generator</strong> object inside the template's <strong>package.json</strong> file:</p><p>You can find more information about the Generator configuration <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#configuration-file">here</a>.	 </p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>The process of creating content from React components consists of two steps: transpile and render.	 </p><p>The SDK has a custom transpiler which ensures that any directory in template's <strong>template</strong> folder are transpiled using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup">Rollup</a>. Rollup helps bundling all dependencies and transpile them into CommonJS modules. This is required because this library will be used through NodeJS (by AsyncAPI Generator) which does not understand these new modules natively and we do not want to limit the developer in which syntax they prefer nor how they want to separate code.</p><p>Also, SDK has its own reconciler. It traverses through each element in the template structure and transforms it into a pure string. Prop <code>children</code> is always converted to a regular string and stored in the <code>childrenContent</code> prop in each component. Check the below example, to see how it works. In addition, you can also see how to apply the composition to templates using components:</p><p>There are some restrictions:</p><ul><li>React hooks feature is not allowed.</li><li>HTML tags are not supported.</li><li>React internal components like <code>Fragments</code>, <code>Suspense</code>, and others are skipped.</li></ul><h2 id="comparison-with-nunjucks">Comparison with Nunjucks</h2><p>The AsyncAPI generator still uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> as a default render engine. It's a templating language, heavily focused on string literals, filters (similar to bash pipes), and partials called macros.	</p><p>The next sections compare how you can accomplish certain things in Nunjucks and React. For more complex examples, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> repository with examples based on React and compare those with <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">nunjucks</a> branch.</p><h3 id="creating-reusable-parts">Creating reusable parts</h3><p>It may sound obvious, but when writing any code, even a template, a programmer wants to create reusable parts that separate repeating logic.</p><p>In Nunjucks, you can reuse parts of the template using <strong>macros</strong>, in React, using <strong>components</strong>. Imagine that you are writing a template that produces Markdown content. You need to create a reusable macro/component that renders a list from an array of strings.</p><p>Using Nunjucks you can write the code below:</p><p>Using React you can write the code below:</p><p>Looking at both examples we see that in Nujucks we operate on string literals, it means that when passing data to a macro, you always need to know what type of data the macro takes. In React we operate on JS objects/variables. By this, your IDE should always inform you what value, of what type, you must pass to component. Additionally, you must place Nunjucks's macro inside the <strong>partials</strong> folder of the template. Using React, you can put your components wherever you want.</p><h3 id="using-third-party-packages">Using third party packages</h3><p>Using helper functions from third-party packages, in Nunjucks you must apply them as <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#filters">filters</a>. For example, you want to use one function from <a href="https://github.com/esamattis/underscore.string">Underscore.string</a> library like <strong>cleanDiacritics</strong>, which replaces diacritic characters with closest ASCII equivalents. To do this, you must create a function inside <strong>filters</strong> folder to convert the function to Nunjucks's filter:</p><p>And then you can use this function inside your template/macro:</p><p>The main problem with this solution is that it creates an unnecessary boilerplate - you must create a function in a separate file. Another problem is that you operate on the name of this helper function which means you must always remember what filters you have included in your template.</p><p>In opposite, in React you can use <code>Underscore.string</code> directly in your template:</p><p>It is worth mentioning that when using packages in this way, you always operate on the reference to the function, not on its name, so you know what functions you have in the file's scope.</p><h2 id="cons--pros">Cons &amp; Pros</h2><p>Like any solution, React has its advantages as well as disadvantages.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>Using React, you use JS directly. You don't need to learn custom Nunjuck's syntax, only how React works under the hood.</li><li>It provides better debugging functionality that is not possible with Nunjucks.</li><li>It provides better error stack traces.</li><li>Better tools support development. You write templates in JavaScript, you use a reference to functions/variables, and therefore your IDE can tell you what you can use in a given scope.	</li><li>Provides better support for separating code into more manageable chunks/components. You don't need to create <strong>partials</strong> folder. You can create React component wherever you want, also next to the template's source code.</li><li>You can easily test your components. It is difficult with Nunjucks. You can split template file into separate chunks and test them in separate test cases.</li></ul><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Common pain when writing templates with React is related to indentations and new lines. However, we have several helpers in SDK to make your life easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Indent.tsx"><code>Indent</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Text.tsx"><code>Text</code></a> components.</li><li>Some people don't like to mix logic inside template files, so probably React won't be friendly for them.</li><li>HTML tags at the moment are not supported. The developer must write them as a string literal, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/blob/main/components/ListChannels.js#L18">here</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>We use React render engine already in three official AsyncAPI templates:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> template showcases features of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">the AsyncAPI Generator</a>, including the React renderer. It shows how to write templates, reusable parts (components), what are the recommended patterns. It has simple and complex examples. You can also check how the same things could be done using Nunjucks in <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">this</a> branch.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/markdown-template">markdown-template</a> is written using React. It generates documentation into a Markdown file.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/ts-nats-template/">ts-nats-template</a> is re-written using React to generate a TypeScript NATS client.</li></ul><p>If you want to check the source code of React renderer, go to the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">official repository</a>.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>There is a long way ahead of us to stabilize React as a render engine. We know about problems that make it unpleasant to write templates using React, such as indents or new lines, but we will work on that. Additionally, we have a couple of improvements on our list that will allow things like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/10">File Templates</a> to be simplified in the Generator. We also plan to support <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/3">TypeScript</a>.</p><p>We are waiting for your feedback.</p><p>Happy coding!</p><blockquote><p>Cover photo is from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080179/"><code>Drunken Master</code></a> movie.</p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611636833572/KkMic2coN.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>  is an open-source low code platform for developers to build internal apps and workflows.</p>
<p>In Appsmith, our developer users define business logic by writing any JS code in between <code>{{ }}</code> dynamic bindings almost anywhere in the app. They can use this while creating SQL queries, APIs, or triggering actions.
This functionality lets you control how your app behaves with the least amount of configuration. Underneath the hood, the platform will evaluate all this code in an optimized manner to make sure the app remains performant yet responsive.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of binding a query response to a table widget.</p>
<p>It all starts with the binding brackets <code>{{ }}</code> . When the platform sees these brackets and some code in it, in a widget or action configuration, it will flag the field as a dynamic field so that our evaluator can pick it up later. In our example let us bind usersQuery to usersTable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182443695/gunous9nM.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.08_PM.png"></p>
<p>Since we have added this binding in our tableData field, we will flag this field and store it in our widget config</p>
<pre><code>
{
  <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        ...
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [
            {<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the background, our evaluation listener, always keeps a lookout for such events that would need an evaluation. For our example, this is a scenario that definitely needs an evaluation, so it kicks off our evaluator.</p>
<p>We pass on our current list of app data constructed in what we call as <code>DataTree</code> to the evaluator thread and patiently wait to hear back from it ⏱</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"config"</span>: {...},
        <span>"data"</span>: [...]
    },
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [{<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, we run our evaluation process in a separate background thread with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>. This ensures that evaluation cycles running longer than 16ms do not hang up the main thread giving the app bandwidth to always respond to user events.</p>
<p>Inside the thread, the event listener gets a wake-up call and gets to work. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get differences</strong>: First it will calculate differences in the <code>DataTree</code> from the last time. This will ensure we only process changes and not the whole tree.</p>
<p>  In our example, we would see the <code>usersTable.tableData</code> has changed and <code>usersTable.dynamicBindingPathList</code> has a new entry.</p>
<p>  It takes each difference, filters any un-important changes, and processes the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get evaluation order with dependency map</strong>: It also maintains a <code>DependencyMap</code> between various entity properties. The evaluator will notice if any bindings have changed and recreate the sort order accordingly.</p>
<p>  For our example, we will infer that <code>usersTable.tableData</code> now depends on <code>usersQuery.data</code>. This means that the query response should always be evaluated before we can evaluate the table data and that whenever we see a change in the query response, we need to re-evaluate the table data as well</p>
<pre><code>  
  {
      ...
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>: [<span>"usersQuery.data"</span>]
  }

  
  [
      <span>"usersQuery.data"</span>,
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate:</strong> After creating an optimized evaluation order, we will evaluate the update the tree, in that said order. Evaluation happens via a closed <code>eval</code> function with the whole <code>DataTree</code> acting as its global scope. This is why we can directly reference any object in our <code>DataTree</code> in our code.</p>
<pre><code>  

  <span>const</span> code = <span>`
    usersQuery.data.map(row =&gt; ({
      name: row.name,
      email: row.email
    }))
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> scriptToEvaluate = <span>`
    function closedFunction () {
      const result = <span>${code}</span>;
      return result
    }
    closedFunction()
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> result = <span>eval</span>(scriptToEvaluate);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and parse:</strong> We always want to make sure the values returned after evaluation to be in the right data type that the widget expects. The ensures the widget always gets predictable data even if your code has returned some errors. This is also needed for any function down the line in the evaluation order, if it refers to this field, will always get a reasonable data type to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that completes it. At the end of this, we will have a fully evaluated <code>DataTree</code> that we can then send back to the main thread and start listening for any new event to do this whole process again.</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"data"</span>: [...] 
    }
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: [...]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our main thread gets an event saying the evaluation is complete, with the new evaluated <code>DataTree</code> which it stores in the app redux state. From here, the widgets pick up their data and render it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182466454/vym6oXaQG.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.22_PM.png"></p>
<h3 id="summarizing-our-philosophy">Summarizing our philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pull vs Push:</strong> While building a low code app builder for varied developers, we thought hard about how the written code works with the rest of the platform. We wanted configuration to be easy to start yet powerful when it needed to be. For this reason, we went with a Pull based architecture rather than Push.</p>
<p>  What this means is that in most places, you won't have to think about how the data will get to a field. You write code that pulls everything from the global <code>DataTree</code> and sets it to the field where you write it. This way the moment the underlying data changes, it get propagated to all the fields dependant on it and you as a developer do not have to orchestrate ui changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> One-way data flow:</strong> Since we are built on top React.js and Redux, we strongly embrace the one-way data flow model.</p>
<p>  What this means is that you cannot set a table's data directly to that field from some other part of the app. If you do need to update the table, you will have to trigger the query to run, which will then cause the table to re-render with the new data. This helps the code you write easy to reason about and bugs easy to find. It also encapsulates each widget's and action's logic in itself for good separation of concern.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do you mean, exactly, by “CPU”?</strong></p>



<p>Once upon a time, computers sat on our desks; we knew exactly how many processors they had; and back then our biggest uncertainty was whether they could handle Y2K. Fast forward to today: our computers have 4, 8 or 16 processors — or quite possibly all of those at the same time, depending on how you define “processor.” (I’m using the terms “CPU” and “processor” interchangeably.) In this post I’ll describe “<em>processor sockets</em>,” “<em>processor cores</em>,” and “<em>processor threads</em>” with the goal of being able to answer “just how many CPUs do I have here?”</p>



<p>Most of us can readily rattle off the three words behind the initialism “CPU”: <em>“central processing unit!</em>” With today’s complex processors, however, we’re now faced with having to clarify whether the unit we speak of is</p>



<ul><li>a hardware package (a “socket”),</li><li>an independent execution unit (a “core”) within that package; or</li><li>a largely dependent unit (a “thread”) within that core that is more logical abstraction than anything else.</li></ul>



<p>Why do we now have this complexity? And, how did we get here? A brief look at each of these concepts should put it all in context.</p>



<h2>Processor Sockets</h2>



<p>This is the oldest of the three concepts, and the easiest to understand. A CPU socket is a receptacle, a physical connector linking the processor to the computer’s motherboard (the primary circuit board for the computer). Most PCs of the Y2K era (the 1990s) had just one CPU (and hence just one CPU socket). If you wanted another CPU then you needed a motherboard with another CPU socket. Two-socket PC motherboards first appeared around 1995. Multiple-socket motherboards were quite expensive and thus tended to be limited to higher-end servers.</p>



<p>You also needed an OS capable of making use of the additional processors, one with SMP* support: Windows 98 wouldn’t work (but Windows NT could) and if you were using Linux back then you’d probably need to recompile your kernel.</p>



<p>The number of CPU sockets on your motherboard is, of course, the same as the number of discrete CPU packages in your system (assuming you didn’t leave any sockets empty). By extension, <strong>the term “processor sockets” can refer to these discrete CPU packages themselves</strong> — handy when needing to distinguish this sense from the other two processor senses. A processor in the <em>socket</em>-sense is quite tangible: it’s something you can buy. (You can’t buy a <em>core</em> by itself — although you could rent one in the cloud!)</p>



<h2>Processor Cores</h2>



<p>Around 2005 both AMD and Intel started taking multiple processors and putting them in the same package: <strong>think of this as two CPUs sharing the same socket</strong>. There are some technical advantages to doing so (<em>e.g.</em> faster cache coherency as it’s not limited by the motherboard) along with the manufacturing advantages (the cores are usually, although not always, manufactured in the same die). Processor manufacturers turned to this model (more cores rather than faster cores) after being unable to increase clock speeds significantly after reaching the GHz range. Each processor core can execute code independently (whatever the layout: whether the cores are all on the same die, sharing the same processor socket, or each core has its own processor socket), although there are slight variances due to shared caches and bus layout.</p>



<p>Total core count is today the most important processor metric when planning systems with independent parallel workloads (such as those of today’s servers), taking the primary place CPU clock frequency held for comparing processors two decades ago.</p>



<h2>Processor Threads</h2>



<p><strong>Processor threads are “logical processors”</strong>: the CPU reports more processors than physically exist.</p>



<p>In 2002 Intel Corporation introduced the “Xeon MP” and “Pentium 4 HT” processors – the first processors with what Intel called “Hyper-Threading Technology.” Sill commonly called “hyperthreading” (the Kleenex of the processor world; the generic term is “simultaneous multithreading” or “SMT”), it was an attempt to speed computer processing by having another thread ready to run – and for the most part, it worked. I say “for the most part” because its advantage turned out to be highly workload dependent, speeding some workloads up dramatically and having a negative effect on others, <em>slowing them down considerably</em>. Many guides recommended disabling hyperthreading in the BIOS – particularly early on before software became hyperthreading-aware. Overall, however, hyperthreading has been a net gain, boosting performance (some say by 15%) for generic workloads, which why we still commonly see it on new processors today.</p>



<p>Hyperthreading is a hardware optimization to an old problem. Processors are often data-starved, waiting on I/O requests from slower storage. Operating systems solved this problem by giving the processor a different program or thread when the current one runs out of work: this is called a context-switch. The problem with context switches is that they are slow: the current state of the thread has to be copied from the CPU registers (super-fast memory locations within the CPU) back to main memory (RAM – very slow by comparison) and the new thread’s state has to then be copied into those registers. This process takes a few microseconds — a few thousand CPU cycles.</p>



<p>Hyperthreading solved this problem by having a second set of these super-fast registers already loaded and ready to go. This second set of registers, which only increases the processor die size by 5%, is presented to the computer as a second CPU, utilizing the same SMP architecture designed for multiple-processors. Hyperthreading doesn’t double your performance because it doesn’t give you a second physical processing unit: instead you just get a second set of CPU registers masquerading as a second CPU.</p>



<p>There are many architecture-specific nuances when it comes to processor threads and their degree of autonomy. All implementations, however, have this in common: threads are dependent (at least partially if not entirely) on resources shared with other threads on the same core.</p>



<p>In summary:</p>



<ul><li><em>processor socket</em> — a package of processors sharing a physical connection to the motherboard</li><li><em>processor core</em> — an independent processor</li><li><em>processor thread</em> — a “logical processor” sharing resources with other threads on the same core</li></ul>



<p>The 4/8/16-processor computer in this post’s opening paragraph is a four-socket server with dual-core CPUs in each socket, each core having two threads. It has:</p>



<ul><li>4 processor sockets,</li><li>8 total processor cores, or</li><li>16 total processor threads.</li></ul>



<h2>So how many CPUs do I have?</h2>



<p>You can see the number of sockets, cores, and threads on a Linux server via the “lscpu” command and focusing on the “Thread(s) per core,” “Core(s) per socket” and “Socket(s)” lines:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="806" height="486" src="https://www.xtivia.com/media/Linux-lscpu.png" alt="Sockets, Cores, and Threads - Linux lscpu"></figure>



<p>The total number of processor threads can be calculated by multiplying the number of sockets by the number of cores per socket and the number of threads per core.</p>



<p>On Windows 10 you can see the breakdown under the Performance tab of the Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Esc to launch Task Manager; click “More details” if you don’t see tabs):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="211" height="82" src="https://www.xtivia.com/media/Windows-SocketsCoresLogicalProcessors.png" alt="Sockets, Cores, and Threads - Windows-Sockets Cores Logical Processors"></figure>



<p>Note that, on Windows, processor threads are called “Logical processors” (arguably a better name). Task Manager shows total <em>Cores</em> (rather than cores-per-socket) and total threads (total <em>Logical processors</em>, rather than threads-per-core).</p>


<p>[*<em>Symmetric multiprocessing</em> (“SMP”) is specifically a computer architecture with two or more identical processors (CPUs) in which each processor can access all of the main memory equally, but since NUMA hadn’t hit the PC world yet we just thought of SMP support as multiprocessor support.]</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Before we begin, I have an announcement to make regarding the future of this podcast. Beginning February 1st, <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em> will become part of the copper membership tier of my new website, <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. Now, the copper tier will include every future episode of the end game, the super terrific happy hour and the narrative game, as well as access to a series of special one-on-one conversations I’ll be having with a group of truly extraordinary people throughout the rest of this year, beginning with my dear friend and mentor, Anthony Deden of Edelweiss Holdings. At the site, you’ll also find a silver tier, which in addition to access to <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em>, will include a year subscription to my monthly newsletter, <em>Things That Make You Go Hmmm…</em> But you can find out a lot more about all that by visiting <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. And now on with the show.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Something that’s fascinated me over the last 12 months has been how keen people are to hear my views on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. I’ve tried to lay out my position as clearly as I can over that year. And I’ll do the same again here. I understand the bull case for crypto very, very well. In many ways, it’s a similar case to the one I’ve been making myself over the years for gold. Because of that, I’ve been predisposed to be bullish on Bitcoin, but like anything I come across that looks interesting, I maintain what I view as a healthy level of skepticism until I’ve had any fears allayed. As far as Bitcoin goes, I’m just not quite there yet. There are things which concern me about its long-term viability. And so until I can have those questions answered to my satisfaction, Bitcoin, to me, remains a highly speculative asset.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>The difficulty I’ve found in getting my questions answered stems largely from the binary opinion set that I’ve found wherever I’ve searched for those answers. Bitcoin, it seems is either going to eat the world or it’s a complete Ponzi scheme. And finding a space between those two opinions where my possible answers might lie, has proven very difficult for me. Last week, an extremely negative article about Tether, the supposedly dollar-backed stablecoin, did the rounds and from the commentary and discussion around that article, the idea of a debate rose organically on FinTwit, a debate that I was asked to moderate. Needless to say in my own search for answers to my questions, I was happy to oblige. And so here we are.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Joining me today are Mike Green of Logica Funds, a man with a towering intellect and a decidedly negative view of Bitcoin (and Tether for that matter). And Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures &amp; CoinMetrics and another man in position of some serious intellectual firepower, but who sees Bitcoin in a completely different and extremely positive light. But the idea here is to offer both sides of the Bitcoin debate, a chance to speak and engage respectfully with the other, in the hopes of providing anybody listening with something to either challenge their own assumptions, answer nagging questions they might have, or simply provide them with some good old fashioned confirmation bias. The goal isn’t to change anybody’s mind about Bitcoin, although who knows, maybe that can actually happen in either direction, but rather to have a thoughtful, respectful conversation about what is… No matter which side of the debate you find yourself on the hottest topic in finance right now. So let’s get to it. A conversation with Mike Green and Nic Carter.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome both of you to this special podcast that kind of arose organically. And I’m absolutely delighted that the two you were willing to take the time to come on and talk about this because there’s been so much said and written about Bitcoin, obviously, on both sides and right at the top of the show, I’m going to position myself and explain to everybody where I am because I think that’s important for the guy in the middle to understand. I like to refer myself as a ‘bit skeptic’. I understand the potential promise of Bitcoin. I’ve heard some very smart people say very smart things about… A lot of which resonates with me from my time in the precious metals space, but I have questions that I just don’t really… There are things that just don’t quite click with me.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>There are problems that I worry about and what I’ve found when I’ve been on the fringes of this space is that, it’s difficult to get thoughtful, considered answers that… Particularly on Twitter. Thoughtful, considered answers, that don’t just degenerate very quickly into a slanging match from both sides. So to have two thoughtful guys like you, join me on the podcast is a real treat for me. So thank you both for doing that.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>What we’re going to do, I think, is start talking about Bitcoin. And then as part of the conversation that I want to discuss, however, briefly, or however long it takes, the recent Tether piece, the doomsday piece, which got everybody’s in a flat a few days ago. So I think what I might do is start with you, Nic. And just to give us really your kind of introduction to Bitcoin and your thoughts on what it is and what it potentially could be. And perhaps any of the things that trouble you about it, if there is anything, in fact.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>Sure. Yeah. And thanks so much for moderating, Grant. I’m a big fan of your show. And Mike, thanks for agreeing to the debate as well. I’m really excited to talk with you. A fan of yours as well. So from my perspective, I’ve been sort of professionally involved in Bitcoin probably since about 2017. It was when I joined Fidelity as their Bitcoin analyst, right. So I was probably one of the first folks on Wall Street sort of be a dedicated Bitcoin guy. Prior to that, I was just an enthusiast, right. I was an amateur Bitcoiner. I mean, there wasn’t really a crypto industry before that, right. And now, my current affiliation is partner at a venture fund and we invest in startups building on public blockchains. So, I certainly believe in this stuff, putting my capital to work, and I believe in the vision of the future that includes cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>The way I see Bitcoin is, it’s kind of two things in one. It is a protocol for sending value through communications medium and encoding value and information. And it’s also an asset. It’s a monetary asset and I would compare it to commodity. So I would say it’s a non-state monetary commodity. It’s something that stores value over time and space. And it’s an independent system of property rights where rather it proposes a state independent system of property rights. So you don’t need an established legal system or a police force or the state to enforce the rights. The rights are enforced through cryptography. And so in that respect, it’s sort of contextually important. So in some cases where you have a functioning financial system, functioning legal system, that has no risk of expropriation, you have no need for Bitcoin, right.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>So in the US, that would characterize most people. They’re puzzled by it. They don’t really see the need for a Bitcoin because everything works great here for now, at least. In other countries where property rights are not really respected and you have inflation or devaluations, or just simply people’s funds, banks accounts get seized on a frequent basis, then maybe there is more of a need for a non-state system. So those are the countries where we’re seeing some adoption of Bitcoin. You also see plenty of Americans getting exposure to it, maybe an anticipation of a future time when it becomes super relevant or just out of the speculative mania too.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>But quite briefly, that’s how I see it. I think it’s important for there to be non-state monetary technologies. I think Bitcoin is extremely promising and it improves upon gold in some really critical respects, particularly along the domain of auditability, verifiability and taking physical settlement, which is where I think it really improves upon gold. But I think if you are positively disposed towards gold, you should probably take a look at Bitcoin because it’s really similar in some of its critical features. Although, of course, not the same thing by any means. So that’s my sort of very short description of Bitcoin.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Yeah. It’s really interesting. And I think my time spent in the precious metal space where my… I was originally exposed to Bitcoin, I saw the similarities between the Bitcoin proposition as it was then, and the things that gold has. I definitely have a few questions about those supposed improvements upon gold, which we’ll get into later on. But I want to turn it over to Mike. Mike, just if you can, your… Because, obviously, your view on Bitcoin is the polar opposite to Nic’s. And so I’m curious to get an overview of that and the things that concern you the most. And then we can perhaps dive into some of these things.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>So it’s interesting because I actually don’t think that we are necessarily polar opposites. I think that we have very strongly divergent opinions in terms of the value of it. So my introduction to Bitcoin happened back in 2012, my wife likes to point out that she expressed interest in buying it at $25 and wanted to put $10,000 in. And I said, “Well, why don’t we actually put money in that matters?” And so do $100,000. And she, of course, said that’s far too much and did nothing with it, right. Now, my view on Bitcoin for a very long time was get yourself to neutral. Own enough that it’s not going to make you crazy rich and own enough that you’re not sitting there with an incredible amount of FOMO as you watch others get rich around you.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>I changed that view in 2020 for a very, very simple reason, which is, as I began to see the dynamic of Americans express the view that Bitcoin was the solution to an overly aggressive central …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>In the beginning of 2020, I left my job at <a href="https://www.vara.ai/">Vara</a>, where I worked as a Software Engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/farewell-socker-mom-evghenii-kondratenko/">Soccer
Mom</a> and Regulatory Affairs Person. I didn’t really know what to do next. While I enjoyed
the Coding and Soccer Mom Duties, one thing was for sure: No more regulatory work, ever.</p>

<p>Fast-forward one year. I spent the year doing regulatory work. <em>What the hell?</em></p>

<p>I worked as a regulatory consultant at Ada, MindPeak, imvaria and countless of other, lesser-known startups.</p>

<p><em>But.. why? And what the hell is regulatory consulting?</em></p>

<p>If you develop medical software, lots of regulations suddenly apply to you. Historically, they were created to
prevent you from killing patients with your software. A sensible goal. Unfortunately, those regulatory
requirements are written in a very generic, unhelpful way. It’s not really their fault, either: They simply
have to handle all sorts of edge cases. Like, the same rule may have to cover breast implants and machine
learning software.</p>

<p>That’s where regulatory consultants come in. And that’s where I came in when I joined my first few clients in
February 2020.</p>

<p>I was very transparent about my knowledge. Like, <em>Hey, listen, I appreciate that you want to hire me, but I
accomplished this goal exactly once (at Vara) and I have no clue how much knowledge I’m lacking</em>.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, all of them continued to hire me. And even more surprisingly, I saw the work which other
consultants had done before me and noticed.. it was bad. Wait, does that mean I was better? That doesn’t sound
right.</p>

<p>I certainly didn’t know the regulations very well. So I couldn’t be better.</p>

<p>But then I learnt: Knowing regulations very well doesn’t mean you’ll be a great regulatory consultant. Just
like knowing medical textbooks well won’t make you a great doctor, and perfect programming skills won’t make
you a great developer. Developing software is not about writing code, it’s about solving problems.</p>

<p>Certainly, those <em>hard</em> skills don’t hurt, but unless they’re coupled with sufficient <em>soft</em> skills, they’re
useless. Also, the hard-skill-soft-skill classification doesn’t work very well here, as essentially, we’re
talking about multiple <em>hard</em> skills.</p>

<p>For regulatory consulting, those are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project management:</strong> How the hell can we accomplish a huge task which needs input from almost everyone
in the company?</li>
  <li><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> We’re only a three-person startup. How can we become compliant with minimal effort?</li>
  <li><strong>Concreteness:</strong> Don’t give us a talk about how things work. Show us how to fill out those documents!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have project management skills, you’ll never get done. The idea of the magical consultant who
comes in, sits in a corner, creates a pile of documents and leaves again (after charging a huge sum of money)
is just that, magical. It doesn’t work. Compliance is an all-team effort.</p>

<p>If you don’t have pragmatism, you’ll get caught up in regulatory overengineering. Like working on a document
for more than a day. Does that mean you should be sloppy?  No - meticulous work is important. But look, you
might have to fill out 80 documents, and if you spend two days on one, you can do the maths and see when
you’ll be done with the remaining 79. You can always go back and improve stuff when you’re done. But if you’re
never done, you’ll never go to market and your company will run out of money.</p>

<p>And finally, if you don’t have concreteness, you end up being something like an in-house lecturer. Always
happy to give workshops and answer theoretical questions, but when it comes to actually <em>doing</em> stuff, like
filling out documents, then things get tricky.</p>

<p>Many consultants are lacking in those areas.</p>

<p>Please note: I’m not ranting or bashing consultants here! I think that this combination of skills is very
rare, regardless of industry. And startups are a part of the problem - because, if those skills are so
important, why are they not selecting consultants with exactly those skills?</p>

<p>That’s the thing. Startups who hire consultants don’t really know what they need. It’s a misunderstanding of
the job to be done: Startups don’t need someone with perfect regulatory knowledge. They need someone to make
them compliant. Sounds like the same, but it is not.</p>

<p>Making a company compliant includes all of the above and more. It’s a huge problem, and nobody has solved it
well. In the meantime, Healthcare startups are struggling.</p>

<p>I think it can be solved well. That’s why I choose regulatory consulting.</p>

<hr>

<p>So - how can we solve regulatory compliance for startups? The problem is complex, but we can roughly decompose
it into two sub-problems:</p>

<p>From the startups perspective:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What the hell do we need to do?</li>
  <li>How the hell do we do it?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before I dive into how we currently “solve” these problems, it’s worth mentioning that Germany has
recently launched a program for apps to become reimbursable by public insurances. Of course, it’s highly
regulated. But in this case, there’s a <a href="https://www.bfarm.de/EN/MedicalDevices/DiGA/_node.html">comprehensive, modern website</a> which even includes a
<a href="https://www.bfarm.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/MedicalDevices/DiGA_Guide.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">128-page pdf guide</a> in easily-understandable language with lots of examples. Awesome!
Things are moving in the right direction for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, before we get too optimistic, let’s turn our attention back to medical device compliance. There’s no
shiny website and no readable pdf. So how do we solve the two problems above?</p>

<p>The state-of-the-art answer of regulatory consultants is <em>billable hours</em>: Let’s do a 8-hour workshop and
we’ll explain it to you. Unfortunately, that often only answers question 1), what needs to be done. It still
remains unclear <em>how</em> to actually do it.</p>

<p>That’s where <em>templates</em> come in. Templates are a custom set of pre-written documents which consultants “sell”
to their clients by implicitly sharing them only when a longer-term contract (billable hours) is signed. That
answers question 2), how to achieve regulatory compliance. By filling out the templates.</p>

<p>Now, I’m trying not to sound negative here, I’m simply stating the facts. I think workshops are a viable way
of sharing this sort of highly-customized, it-depends-on-your-company knowledge. And sharing templates only
with your clients makes sense, because you always need to heavily customize them. Because every company is a
unique snowflake. Right?</p>

<p><em>Right?</em></p>

<p>Or maybe not. Maybe every company isn’t a unique snowflake.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a common denominator of regulatory things which apply to every company. Maybe there is a common
set of knowledge, and a common set of minimalistic templates which can be re-used.</p>

<p>And if something can be re-used - shouldn’t it be shared?</p>

<p>Consultants like to think that openly sharing knowledge and templates is a zero-sum game: The more you share,
the more people can do by themselves, the less billable hours you have.</p>

<p>That may be true. Maybe not. In any case, I think it’s a huge misalignment of incentives. Why are we here in
the first place? To bill hours? Or to bring medical innovation to patients? What if we have the choice between
bringing one device to market while getting paid, or bringing ten devices to market, for free?</p>

<p>I’d choose the ten devices, any time, as long as I have enough money to pay my bills. And right now I do.</p>

<p>I think that sharing knowledge (and technology) for free is <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/">not a zero-sum
game</a>. If I publish my knowledge, will that cost me money every time
someone reads it? Of course not. Will it reduce my billable hours? Maybe. But then again, I’m tired of
regulatory consulting because a large chunk of it is repetitive and mind-numbing.</p>

<p>So, today, I’m launching <a href="https://www.openregulatory.com/">OpenRegulatory</a>. It’s a place where I’ve started brain-dumping all
my consultant knowledge and templates, for free. And it’s my new company.</p>

<p>It’s not complete, but it’s a start. The <a href="https://openregulatory.com/templates/">templates</a> are mostly done, and there’s a
<a href="https://openregulatory.com/blueprint-certifying-medical-software/">step-by-step guide</a> on how to certify software as a medical device.</p>

<p>If you want to talk to other Healthcare startup people, there’s a friendly <a href="https://openregulatory.com/community/">Slack
Community</a> full of people willing to share their experiences.</p>

<p>If you need even more concreteness, there are <a href="https://openregulatory.com/screencasts/">videos in which you can watch me create
documentation</a> from scratch.</p>

<p>And finally, most obviously, being a software developer at heart, there’s a
<a href="https://openregulatory.com/formwork/">software</a> which automates many of the most tedious tasks.</p>

<p>If we want medical device innovation to scale, sharing knowledge openly is the only way forward. Let’s see if
we’re up to the challenge.</p>

<p>This trains a simple <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/">transformer</a> model for auto-regression.
We try different variants for the <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/feed_forward">position-wise feedforward network</a>.</p>
<p><em>This is a simpler implementation that doesn’t use <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/glu_variants/experiment.html"><code>labml.configs</code></a> module.
We decided to write a simpler implementation to make it easier readers who are not familiar.</em></p>

<h3>[ 2020-September-07 16:07 ]</h3>
<p>We build software on a huge stack of pre-existing software. This raises the question of when do we update those dependencies? The policy that emerges if you do nothing is that dependencies are updated when you have a clear need, such as requiring a feature that is only available in the latest version. Otherwise, you keep using the version of the operating system, libraries, and tools you installed when you first needed them. In my opinion, this is a bad policy. For projects actively being developed, I believe it is well worth the effort to use the latest stable release of your dependencies. This means you need to constantly spend some effort to stay up to date. However, I believe this <em>saves</em> effort in the long run, by avoiding bugs and reducing the total time spent applying updates. In the rest of this article, I will explain my position. As with most software engineering topics, I'm going to argue based on my own experience, and without any data.</p>


<h2>Disadvantages of updating dependencies</h2>

<p>There are two disadvantages to updating your dependencies. First, any change to a software system has some risk of introducing errors. Even if the update is a bug fix (e.g. going from version 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 in <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>), it might break your program. Your code might depend on some behaviour that was changed by the "fix," causing your program to break (see: <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum's Law</a>). Hence, the least risky thing to do when maintaining an application is change it as little as possible. That means not updating dependencies.</p>

<p>The second disadvantage is that it takes effort, and does not provide any user-visible improvement. The argument is that instead of spending the time to update your dependencies, you should spend that time doing something that directly benefits users instead. While the effort may be small, there is usually <em>some</em> work involved, even if it is just  changing version numbers. If your process is automated, then you've spent the effort in the past to build and maintain the automation, so it still cost something. Even worse, on the rare case that an update breaks your software, you will need to debug it, which might be the worst of all, since you don't suspect it and usually can't plan for it. At least incompatible major versions usually give you a hint that you may need to spend some effort, so you can plan for it. At the extreme, you might be depending on a feature that has been removed in the latest version, which means you cannot update without substantial effort.</p>


<h2>Advantages of updating dependencies</h2>

<p>The first advantage of updating is that you avoid some unknown bugs. A well-managed software project generally improves over time. While that "improvement" may be uneven, and some releases may regress, if a project isn't improving, it dies. Hence, if you stay current, you are avoiding some bugs in your dependencies. Unfortunately, you will never know which bugs you avoided. On the other hand, you always know exactly what things broke by updating, because you will need to fix it. The fact that the benefits are invisible is what contributes to the perspective that updates don't provide value. However, on rare occasions you can notice the opposite problem: you will discover a bug in a dependency, and find out it has already been fixed in the latest version.</p>

<p>The second advantage to staying up to date is that it is easier to get support for the most recent release. In this context, I mean "support" in the broadest sense. You will find better documentation, it is easier to search for answers on the Internet, and can more easily get help with bug reports. If you are using an older version, it is common for someone to ask you to try it again with the latest version. This "support" cost is very small, and spread across your entire development effort.</p>

<p>The final advantage of updating is that I believe applying regular smaller updates actually takes less total effort than applying big updates less often. This is a bit counter-intuitive: If there is some amount of fixed "per update" effort (e.g. running the "update my dependencies" tool), then shouldn't it be <em>less</em> effort to do one big update instead of a sequence of small updates? In particular, you get to skip updates, which should safe effort. However, I believe the sequence of small updates is more efficient. One big reason is that when you find a problem, it is isolated to a smaller update, so finding and fixing the problem takes less time. When you find a problem in a big batch of updates, the first step tends to try the sequence of smaller updates anyway. Another reason smaller updates are more efficient is if you do it regularly, you get better at it. It forces you to document the process, or write some basic tests or automation for it.</p>


<h2>Opinionated advice about how to do updates</h2>

<p>In my opinion, a well-run software project should regularly update all their dependencies to the latest stable version. However, the exact schedule for how to do this, or how often, will depend on the project and the organization. At the extreme end, you can fully automate the process, which is what parts of the Chrome web browser seem to do <a href="https://skia.googlesource.com/buildbot/+/master/autoroll/README.md">Skia's AutoRoll documentation</a>). A middle ground is to provide a script that generates the update change, but requires some manual approval or shepherding of the change through a build process (e.g. see <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:DEPS">Chrome's DEPS file instructions</a>). I would say that you probably need to be doing this more often than once a year, to avoid some dependencies from not being the most recent "stable" release.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/micha-lmxt/descent-ripple">descent-ripple</a> package provides an easy way to add ripple animations to buttons and button-like UI elements. That means when you click on a button, or whatever UI-component you add this effect to, a short animation will start at the position of the click, which is bound by the borders of the button. This looks nice and also gives the user the feel of a responding UI. It is especially helpful for touch interfaces since it gives the user some feedback about the click position.

<h2 id="h2465289">Getting started
    </h2>

<p>The package can be used with any javascript framework, or even without. Here I will show you how to use it with React, Svelte, or without Framework. The package is written using <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and is already compiled and minimized, so there is no overhead or requirement.
    </p>
<p>You can import the library using:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> </span><span>descent</span><span>-</span><span>ripple</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Then, depending on your framework, you can add the ripple:
    </p>

      <div id="Svelte36502">
<pre><p><code><span><span>// MyButton.svelte</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    import ripple from 'descent-ripple';</span></span>
<span><span>    let rippleOptions = </span><span>{}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;button</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span>:</span><span>ripple</span><span>={</span><span>rippleOptions</span><span>}&gt;</span><span>click me </span><span>&lt;/button&gt;</span></span></code></p>

<p>That's all you need to add the effect and all the examples below just adjust the <code><code>rippleOptions</code></code> object.
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>The ripple function usually adds the needed CSS to your button. If the result is not well-positioned, it could be that your framework is overriding the style property of your button/component. Try to manually add "position:relative" to the style of your button, if the ripple is not in place, and "overflow:hidden", if the ripple draws out of boundaries.
    </p></div>

<h3 id="h3136629">nLines and nCircles
    </h3>

<p>The ripple animates lines and/or circles. With <code><code>nLines</code></code> you say, how many lines you want. Lines are spaced equally around the center. You can have both circles and lines. More than one circle will make sense later when we know how to use delay.

<h3 id="h3308172">lineProps and circleProps
    </h3>

<p>Lines and circles are svg-path and svg-circle elements. Colors are defined by the <code><code>stroke</code></code> and <code><code>fill</code></code> property. Other interesting attributes, especially for the lines, are <code><code>stroke-linecap</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-linejoin</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-miterlimit</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-opacity</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-width</code></code>. You can apply the same props to all circles and lines, or handle each individually. To do that, supply a function of the index:

<h3 id="h3677242">lineBreakDist and rotation

<p>Each path is split into several segments via lineBreakDist. A larger distance means fewer breaks. With <code><code>rotation</code></code>, you can make the lines bend circularly. You can supply a single value or a function on the line-break index. <code><code>rotation</code></code> is measured in degrees.

<h3 id="h3129929">Animation and AnimationProps

<p>By default descent-ripple supports the following animation types from <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>:
<code><code>"draw"</code></code>, <code><code>"scale"</code></code>, <code><code>"fade"</code></code>, <code><code>"blur"</code></code> and <code><code>"fly"</code></code> plus <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code>. All these animations can take props, which typically include <code><code>{delay:number, duration:number, easing: (t:number)=&gt;number}</code></code>, you can look them up on <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>. <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code> accepts the same props as <code><code>"draw"</code></code>. You can change in and out animations for circles and lines and the props can be passed as a function of the circle/line index.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div>
<p>Every build has a story to tell - Tamperproof provenance for your code and CI/CD pipeline</p>
<p>Quickstart here: <a href="https://timestamp.codenotary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://timestamp.codenotary.com</a></p>
<p>The combination of our free, lightning-fast and always-on timestamp service and the easy to use cli tool, gets you started in a minute.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.codenotary.com/images/blog/mascot_timestamp.png" width="350"></p><h2 id="what-means-trusted-timestamping">What means trusted timestamping</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trusted timestamping</a> is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised.
CodeNotary uses its immutable open source database <a href="https://github.com/codenotary/immudb" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immudb</a> to provide this service that includes cryptographic verification and immutable data history.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>This timestamping service provides full immutability for all data ever written and unique data checksum ever stored including its history. As a trust level comes with the timestamp, you can change your mind over time (unsupport, untrust) without touching the code or binary. As the complete trust and timestamping history is stored for any digital identity (SHA-256 checksum), you can easily create workflows and decision trees in your CI/CD recipes.</p>
<p>There are plenty of different use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a trusted timestamp to code</li>
<li>Add an immutable timestamp to electronic signatures</li>
<li>Seal the data integrity and your trust level at a given point in time</li>
<li>Prove the existence of elecronic data at a specific point in time</li>
<li>CI/CD integration - notarize all outgoing assets, authenticate all incoming</li>
<li>Store provenance for you own sources</li>
<li>Unsupport deprecated versions of your software and run update checks bases on the latest timestamp</li>
<li>Revoke trust (untrust) at any time without the need to touch your code or binaries</li>
<li>Trust or remove trust for digital assets and act on the status (within your script or pipeline)</li>
<li>Simply timestamp files and sources to doublecheck at any time in the future if these are still the same (backup/restore)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simply request your API key and get started within a minute! This service is free forever and was built using Open Source!</strong> </p>
<p>Notarized assets informations is stored in a tamperproof ledger with cryptographic verification backed by <a href="https://codenotary.com/technologies/immudb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immudb</a>, the immutable database.</p>
<h3 id="obtain-an-api-key">Obtain an API Key</h3>
<p>To provide access to our timestamping service a valid API Key is required. If you don't have one yet, simply signup here <a href="https://timestamp.codenotary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CodeNotary Timestamp</a>
This API Key is bound to your email address and it's required during vcn login.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Installer</strong> In case you use Linux or macOS, the quickest start is our install script:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code><span>bash</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>curl</span> https://getvcn.codenotary.com -L<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases/latest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">download the latest release</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Login</strong> to <a href="https://timestamp.codenotary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">timestamp.codenotary.com</a></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com 

<span>VCN_LC_API_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>&lt;</span>Your-API-Key vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Notarize existing digital objects</strong> Once you have an account you can start notarizing digital assets to give them an identity.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>vcn n <span>&lt;</span>file<span>|</span>dir://directory<span>|</span>docker://dockerimage<span>|</span>git://gitdirectory<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Authenticate digital objects</strong> You can use the command as a starting point.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>vcn a <span>&lt;</span>file<span>|</span>dir://directory<span>|</span>docker://dockerimage<span>|</span>git://gitdirectory<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For detailed <strong>command line usage</strong>, just run <code>vcn help</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h4 id="wildcard-support-and-recursive-notarization">Wildcard support and recursive notarization</h4>
<p>It's also possible to notarize assets using a wildcard pattern.</p>
<p>With <code>--recursive</code> flag the utility can recursively notarize inner directories.</p>

<h4 id="notarization">Notarization</h4>
<p>Start with the <code>login</code> command. <code>vcn</code> will walk you through login and importing up your secret upon initial use.</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once your secret is set, you can notarize assets like in the following examples:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn notarize &lt;file&gt;
vcn notarize dir://&lt;directory&gt;
vcn notarize docker://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn notarize podman://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn notarize git://&lt;path_to_git_repo&gt;
vcn notarize --hash &lt;hash&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the asset's status:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn unsupport &lt;asset&gt;
vcn untrust &lt;asset&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate &lt;file&gt;
vcn authenticate dir://&lt;directory&gt;
vcn authenticate docker://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn authenticate podman://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn authenticate git://&lt;path_to_git_repo&gt;
vcn authenticate --hash &lt;hash&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>To output results in <code>json</code> or <code>yaml</code> formats:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate --output=json &lt;asset&gt;
vcn authenticate --output=yaml &lt;asset&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h4 id="authenticate-a-docker-image-automatically-prior-to-running-it">Authenticate a Docker image automatically prior to running it</h4>
<p>First, you’ll need to pull the image by using:</p>

<p>Then use the below command to put in place an automatic safety check. It allows only verified images to run.</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate docker://hello-world &amp;&amp; docker run hello-world
</code></pre></div>
<p>If an image was not verified, it will not run and nothing will execute.</p>
<h4 id="authenticate-multiple-assets">Authenticate multiple assets</h4>
<p>You can authenticate multiple assets by piping other command outputs into <code>vcn</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>ls | xargs -n 1 vcn authenticate
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The exit code will be <code>0</code> only if all the assets in you other command outputs are verified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="authenticate-by-a-specific-signer">Authenticate by a specific signer</h4>
<p>By adding <code>--signerID</code>, you can authenticate that your asset has been signed by a specific SignerID.
You can find your own signer id in the output of <code>vcn n</code> or <code>vcn a</code> (Signer).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A SignerID is the signer public address (represented as a 40 hex characters long string prefixed with <code>0x</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate --signerID 0x8... docker://hello-world
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="authenticate-using-the-assets-hash">Authenticate using the asset's hash</h4>
<p>If you want to authenticate an asset using only its hash, you can do so by using the command as shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate --hash fce...
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="unsupportuntrust-an-asset-you-do-not-have-anymore">Unsupport/untrust an asset you do not have anymore</h4>
<p>In case you want to unsupport/untrust an asset of yours that you no longer have, you can do so using the asset hash(es) with the following steps below.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to get the hash of the asset from your CodeNotary Ledger Compliance dashboard or alternatively you can use the <code>vcn list</code> command. Then, in the CLI, use:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn untrust --hash &lt;asset's hash&gt;
# or
vcn unsupport --hash &lt;asset's hash&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="notarization-within-automated-environments">Notarization within automated environments</h4>
<p>First, you’ll need to make <code>vcn</code> have access to the <code>${HOME}/.vcn</code> folder that holds your secret (the private key).
Then, set up your environment accordingly using the following commands:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>VCN_LC_API_KEY</span><span>=</span>Your-API-Key
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once done, you can use <code>vcn</code> in your non-interactive environment using:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com
vcn notarize &lt;asset&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Other commands like <code>untrust</code> and <code>unsupport</code> will also work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="add-custom-metadata-when-signing-assets">Add custom metadata when signing assets</h4>
<p>The user can upload custom metadata when doing an asset notarization using the <code>--attr</code> option, e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn n README.md --attr <span>Testme</span><span>=</span>yes --attr <span>project</span><span>=</span><span>5</span> --attr <span>pipeline</span><span>=</span>test
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command would add the custom asset metadata Testme: yes, project: 5, pipeline: test.</p>
<p>The user can read the metadata back on asset authentication, i.e. using the <code>jq</code> utility:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn a README.md -o json <span>|</span> jq .metadata
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="inspect">Inspect</h4>
<p>Inspect has been extended with the addition of new filter: <code>--last</code>, <code>--first</code>, <code>--start</code> and <code>--end</code>.
With <code>--last</code> and <code>--first</code> are returned the N first or last respectively.</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn inspect document.pdf --last <span>10</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With <code>--start</code> and <code>--end</code> it's possible to use a time range filter:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn inspect document.pdf --start <span>2020</span>/10/28-08:00:00 --end <span>2020</span>/10/28-17:00:00
</code></pre></div>
<p>If no filters are provided, only a maximum of 100 items are returned.</p>
<h4 id="signer-identifier">Signer Identifier</h4>
<p>It's possible to filter results by signer identifier:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn inspect document.pdf --signerID Cyg<span>..</span>.
</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    </p>
  

  <br>

  
    




  

  <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS RDS</a> is a cloud relational database. It’s suitable for both early-stage startups and <em>Web-Scale</em> companies. One catch is that it’s possible to <em>irreversibly</em> loose all your data if you’re using it. In this blog post, I’ll describe why the default backup system offered by RDS is insecure and how to improve it.</p>

<h2 id="one-simple-trick-to-kill-your-startup">One simple trick to kill your startup…</h2>

<p>It’s about as <em>“clickbaity”</em> as it can get but bear with me.</p>

<p>RDS offers a robust backup system. Every database has a continuous backup allowing you to revert it to a specific point in the past. Additionally, point-in-time snapshots are automatically created every day and whenever you perform an action like upgrading the database, etc.</p>

<p>So, where’s the catch here?</p>

<p>Your account. All the backups are stored within a single account. Unless you’re a company with mature security practices, I guess that all your developers use <code>AdministratorAccess</code> or <code>PowerUserAccess</code> IAM policies. It’s not straightforward to fine-tune IAM policies for every single developer, especially when working on more obscure parts of the AWS stack. It’s understandable that unless you’re hiring a full-time AWS security specialist applying admin access for every developer is a sane default.</p>

<p>Why is that an issue?</p>

<p>Everyone with admin access to AWS CLI or console can easily remove all the backups. For most companies losing all data would probably mean that everyone can pack their bags and go home.</p>

<p>Let that sink in. <strong>EVERYONE</strong> in your company with AWS admin access can <strong>IRREVERSIBLY</strong> remove your database and all its backups. Every developer, support agent, an external consultant with admin access is a single point of failure that can destroy your startup. Imagine the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CLI credentials are leaked to a public GitHub repo</li>
  <li>dev mistakes staging for production environment during the cleanup</li>
  <li>the fired developer decides to take the company down with him</li>
  <li>admin’s cat walks on a keyboard and triggers a destructive shell script</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on and on. Better safe than sorry. Let’s learn how you can significantly improve the security of RDS backups.</p>

<h2 id="free-ebook">How to add redundant backups to RDS database [free eBook]</h2>

<p>The good news is that you can protect yourself from these tragic scenarios. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Periodically upload the newest database dump to an S3 bucket in your primary account.</li>
  <li>Replicate data to a bucket in a separate AWS account that only necessary users can access.</li>
  <li>Profit.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the following mechanism in place, even if your primary account is compromised and your data eradicated, you can still restore your project.</p>

<p>You can grab a free eBook describing step-by-step on how to set it up. You’ll receive a link to the eBook just after subscribing to my newsletter.</p>




<p>This eBook covers backups for PostgreSQL, but with few changes to the backup script, it is applicable to all the database engines.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>From my experience, unfortunately, teams only become more security-aware after the actual incident. Secondary <em>“panic”</em> backups is a simple best practice that can save your company from disaster.</p>

<article id="content">
  

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been a contributor to GNU projects for many years, notably both GCC and GNU libc, and recently I led the effort to make the first release of Autoconf since 2012 (<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2020-12/msg00002.html">release announcement for Autoconf 2.70</a>). For background and context, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/834682/">the LWN article my colleague Sumana Harihareswara of Changeset Consulting wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Autoconf not having made a release in eight years is a symptom of a deeper problem. Many GNU projects, including all of the other components of the Autotools (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/">Gnulib</a>, etc.) and the software they depend upon (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">GNU M4</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>, etc.) have seen a steady decline in both contributor enthusiasm and user base over the past decade. I include myself in the group of declining enthusiasts; I would not have done the work leading up to the Autoconf 2.70 release if I had not been paid to do it. (I would like to say thank you to the project funders: Bloomberg, Keith Bostic, and the GNU Toolchain Fund of the FSF.)</p>
<p>The Autotools are in particularly bad shape due to the decline in contributor enthusiasm. Preparation for the Autoconf 2.70 release took almost twice as long as anticipated; I made five beta releases between July and December 2020, and merged 157 patches, most of them bugfixes. On more than one occasion I was asked why I was going to the trouble—isn’t Autoconf (and the rest of the tools by implication) thoroughly obsolete? Why doesn’t everyone switch to something newer, like <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> or <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a>? (See the comments on Sumana’s LWN article for examples.)</p>
<p>I personally don’t think that the Autotools are obsolete, or even all that much more difficult to work with than some of the alternatives, but it <em>is</em> a fair question. Should development of the Autotools continue? If they are to continue, we need to find people who have the time and the inclination (and perhaps also the funding) to maintain them steadily, rather than in six-month release sprints every eight years. We also need a proper roadmap for where further development should take these projects. As a starting point for the conversation about whether the projects should continue, and what the roadmap should be, I was inspired by Sumana’s book in progress on open source project management (<a href="https://changeset.nyc/resources/getting-unstuck-sampler-offer.html">sample chapters are available from her website</a>) to write up a <q>strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats</q> analysis of Autotools.</p>
<p>This inventory can help us figure out how to build on new opportunities, using the Autotools’ substantial strengths, and where to invest to guard against threats and shore up current weaknesses.</p>
<p>Followup discussion should go to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf">the Autoconf mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<p>In summary: as the category leader for decades, the Autotools benefit from their architectural approach, interoperability, edge case coverage, standards adherence, user trust, and existing install base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf’s feature-based approach to compiled-code portability scales better than lists of system quirks.</li>
<li>The Autotools carry 30+ years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps for C programs and shell-based build scripting on Unix (and to a lesser extent Windows and others), including variants of Unix that no other comparable configuration tool supports.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support cross-compilation better than competing build systems.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support software written in multiple languages better than some competing build systems (but see below).</li>
<li>Autoconf is very extensible, and there are lots of third-party <q>macros</q> available.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have fewer build dependencies than tarball releases produced by competing tools.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have a predictable, standardized (literally; it’s a key aspect of the <q><a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/index.html">GNU Coding Standards</a></q>) interface for setting build-time options, building them, testing them, and installing them.</li>
<li>Automake tries very hard to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, not just GNU make, and not even just (GNU or BSD) make.</li>
<li>The Autotools have excellent reference-level documentation (better than CMake and Meson’s).</li>
<li>As they are GNU projects, users can have confidence that Autotools are and will always remain Free Software.</li>
<li>Relatedly, users can trust that architectural decisions are not driven by the needs of particular large corporations.</li>
<li>There is a large installed base, and switching to a competing build system is a lot of work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<p>In summary: Autoconf’s core function is to solve a problem that software developers, working primarily in C, had in the 1990s/early 2000s (during the Unix wars). System programming interfaces have become much more standardized since then, and the shell environment, much less buggy. Developers of new code, today, looking at existing configure scripts and documentation, cannot easily determine which of the portability traps Autoconf knows about are still relevant to them. Similarly, maintainers of older programs have a hard time knowing which of their existing portability checks are still necessary. And weak coordination with other Autotools compounds the issue.</p>
<h3 id="autoconf">Autoconf</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf (and the rest of the Autotools) are written in a combination of four old and difficult programming languages: Bourne shell, the portable subset of Make, Perl, and M4. Competing build systems tend to use newer, more ergonomic languages, which both makes it easier for them to get things done, and makes it easier for them to attract new developers.</li>
<li>All the supported languages except C and C++ are second-class citizens.</li>
<li>The set of languages that are supported has no particular rationale. Several new and increasingly popular compiled-code languages (e.g.&nbsp;Swift and Rust) are not supported, while oddities like Erlang are.</li>
<li>Much of that 30 years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps is obsolete. There’s no systematic policy for deciding when some problem is too obsolete to worry about anymore.</li>
<li>Support for <em>newer</em> platforms, C standard editions, etc. is weaker than support for older things.</li>
<li>Autoconf’s extensibility is unsystematic; many of those third-party macros reach into its guts, and do things that create awkward compatibility constraints on core development. Same for existing <code>configure.ac</code>s.</li>
<li>The code quality of third-party macros varies widely; bad third-party macros reflect poorly on Autoconf proper.</li>
<li>Some of the ancillary tools distributed with Autoconf don’t work well; most importantly, autoupdate (which is <em>supposed</em> to patch a <code>configure.ac</code> to bring it in line with current Autoconf’s recommendations) is so limited and unreliable that it might be better not to have it at all.</li>
<li>Feature gaps in GNU M4 hold back development of Autoconf.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-autotools-as-a-whole">The Autotools as a whole</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are few active developers and no continuing funders.</li>
<li>GNU project status discourages new contributors because of the paperwork requirements and the perceived lack of executive-level leadership.</li>
<li>There is no continuous integration and no culture of code review. Test suites exist but are not comprehensive enough (and at the same time they’re very slow).</li>
<li>Bugs, feature requests, and submitted patches are not tracked systematically. (This is partially dependent on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/the-fsf-tech-team-doing-more-for-free-software">FSF/GNU infrastructure improvements</a> which are indefinitely delayed.)</li>
<li>There’s a history of releases breaking compatibility, and thus people are hesitant to upgrade. At the same time, Linux distributions actively want to force-upgrade everything they ship to ensure architecture support, leading to upstream/downstream friction.</li>
<li>Guide-level documentation is superficial and outdated.</li>
<li>Building an Autotools-based project directly from its VCS checkout is often significantly harder than building it from a tarball release, and may involve tracking down and installing any number of unusual tools.</li>
<li>The Autotools depend on other GNU software that is not actively maintained, most importantly GNU M4, and to a lesser extent GNU Make.</li>
<li>Coordination among the Autotools is weak, even though the tools are tightly coupled to each other. There are portions of codebases that exist solely for interoperability with other tools in the toolchain, which leads to overlapping maintainer and reviewer responsibility, slow code review and inconvenient copyright assignment processes multiplying, and causing confusion and dropped balls. For instance, there is code shared among Autoconf, Automake, and/or Gnulib by copying files between source repositories; changes to these files are extra inconvenient. The lack of coordination also makes it harder for tool maintainers to deprecate old functionality, or to decouple interfaces to make things more extensible; maintainers do not negotiate policies with each other to help. For instance, Autoconf has trouble knowing when it is safe to remove internal kludges that old versions of Automake depend on, and certain shell commands (e.g.&nbsp;aclocal) are distributed with one package but abstractly belong to another.</li>
<li>Division of labor among the Autotools, and the sources of third-party macros, is ad-hoc and unclear. (Which macros should be part of Autoconf proper? Which should be part of Gnulib? Which should be part of the Autoconf Macro Archive? Which should be shipped with Automake? Which tools should autoreconf know how to run? Etc.)</li>
<li>Automake and Libtool are not nearly as extensible as Autoconf is.</li>
<li>Unlike several competitors, Automake <em>only</em> works with Make, not with newer build drivers (e.g.&nbsp;Ninja).</li>
<li>Because Automake tries to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, the Makefiles it generates are much more complicated and slow than they would be if they took advantage of GNU and/or BSD extensions.</li>
<li>Libtool is notoriously slow, brittle, and difficult to modify (even worse than Autoconf proper). This is partially due to technical debt and partially due to maintaining support for completely obsolete platforms (e.g.&nbsp;old versions of AIX).</li>
<li>Libtool has opinions about the proper way to manage shared libraries that Linux distributions actively disagree with, forcing them to kludge around its code during package builds.</li>
<li>Alternatives…</li></ul></div></article></div></div>

<li>If you can’t resolve any hostnames you might be using local unbound on the host. Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add a public DNS server.</li>
<li>If you run this jail on a production server you might want to limit memory usage <code>bastille limits poudriere memoryuse 8G</code>.</li>
<li>The packages will be under /usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/‘jailname’-‘portsname’. You can add the directory to any webserver and point your *pkg.conf to that URL.</li>
<li>You can update the ports tree using <code>poudriere ports -u</code></li>

It seems to me to be mainly used as a corrective against: 1) the Cartesian notion of an immaterial mind, and 2) the materialist tendency to place the mind in the brain. But what are the main positive claims that defenders of embodiment are making?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>I think that the meaning of the term “embodiment” in philosophical circles is deceptively diverse, and that those who champion the concept are motivated by concerns that overlap less than is often appreciated. If they are unified by one thing, it is a rogues’ gallery of common enemies. Although Descartes is the most reviled of these, his errors are often traced back to some original sin perpetrated by Plato. However, in order to make sense of these conceptual crimes, it’s worth first distinguishing the <span>explanatory</span> concerns of cognitive science and artificial intelligence from the <span>normative </span>concerns of political and social theory, while acknowledging that both of these are downstream from more general <span>metaphysical</span> concerns regarding the difference and/or relation between matter and mind. So, though there are many purely metaphysical objections to the Platonic dualism of intelligible and sensible worlds, and the Cartesian dualism of mental and physical substances, what really unites the embodiment paradigm is their objection to the outsized role that Plato, Descartes, and their inheritors give to “the life of the mind” in explaining how we make our way in the world, and establishing which aspects of it we should value. For want of a better word, we might call this “intellectualism”.</p>



<p>This “life of the mind” is distinguished by the capacity for <span>abstract thought</span>. This is to say that it abstracts away from concrete features of the context in which thinking occurs: it is <span>theoretical</span>, or unconstrained by the practical problems posed by our bodily environment; and it is <span>contemplative</span>, or independent of the sensorimotor capacities through which we interact with this environment. Both Plato and Descartes take mathematics to exemplify this sort of thinking, and on that basis, thought <span>as such</span>. Mathematical theorems are not strictly about anything in our physical environment, and they can be verified even if they’re not applicable to it, in ways that needn’t involve interacting with it. This being said, what really distinguishes Descartes from Plato is his conviction that the physical world can be accurately <span>represented</span> by mathematical models, and thus that our experiences can be treated as internal representations akin to such models. There are other problematic aspects of the Cartesian picture, but this will do for now.</p></div><section id="comp-kiemep621"><div data-testid="columns"><div id="comp-kiemep64"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent" data-testid="inline-content"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent-gridContainer" data-testid="mesh-container-content"><p id="comp-kiemep661" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span>WHAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES DESCARTES FROM PLATO IS HIS CONVICTION THAT THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE ACCURATELY REPRESENTED BY MATHEMATICAL MODELS</span></h2></p></div></div></div></div></section><div id="comp-kiemep68" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>So, what are the main explanatory objections to intellectualism?</span></p>



<p>There are two. On the one hand, its opponents claim that intellectualism ignores the vast majority of human cognition: most of our lives are spent carrying out tasks and navigating obstacles whose contours are determined by the way our body fits into its environment, rather than reasoning our way from premises to conclusions. Making a cup of tea in an unfamiliar kitchen is a more representative instance of our problem-solving capacity than demonstrating the infinity of primes. On the other, they claim that intellectualism has its priorities backwards: rather than treating this sort of “skilled coping” as a deficient form of abstract cognition, we can only understand the latter by showing how it emerges from the former. Even our ability to imagine complex geometric constructions has at some point been bootstrapped from a basic bodily grasp of orientation and gesture.</p>



<p>The most important targets of these complaints are the classical computational theory of mind in cognitive science and what gets called “good old-fashioned AI” (GOFAI). These see cognition as principally a matter of rule-governed symbol manipulation not unlike mathematical reasoning. They are opposed by a range of “4E perspectives”, so called because they emphasise some combination of the <span>embodied</span>, <span>embedded</span>, enactive, and <span>extended</span> dimensions of cognition. The extent to which these diverge from traditional views varies, but, in rough order, the points of contention are: 1) the extent to which cognition is dependent on features of the body outside of the brain (e.g., the structure of sensory organs), and features of the environment outside of the body (e.g., the availability of cognitive resources), 2) whether the concepts of computation and representation are irredeemably intellectualist (e.g., if they can account for pre-linguistic “meaning”), and 3) whether dependence implies constitution (e.g., if my notebook is part of my mind).</p>



<p><span>What about the normative objections?</span></p>



<p>Again, there are two. On the one hand, opponents claim that intellectualism reflects and reinforces implicit social hierarchies: those who have historically enjoyed the luxury of theoretical contemplation have done so because the practical problems and bodily processes it abstracts away from have been taken care of for them, often by groups who have been systematically <span>identified</span> with their bodies and bodily capacities, such as women, slaves, and colonised peoples. The disembodied Cartesian ego is an illusion engendered by ignorance and privilege. On the other, they claim that intellectualism devalues significant sources of human knowledge: there are forms of “lived experience” and “situated knowledge” that are valuable even if they aren’t (and possibly can’t be) articulated in a manner that divorces them from the embodied contexts in which they occur (e.g., their emotional valence). This Cartesian false-consciousness doesn’t simply impact the way we treat others, but even the way we treat ourselves, potentially disconnecting us from our embodied existence.</p>



<p>The idea that privileging the mind over the body is associated with other sorts of illicit privilege (e.g., economic, racial, sexual, etc.) is now fairly widespread in contemporary feminist and critical theory. However, there are a variety of philosophical frameworks drawn from the Continental tradition that get used to articulate, elaborate, and offer solutions to this problem. Roughly speaking, the main strands are Spinozist (Deleuze, Affect Theory, etc.), Nietzschean (Foucault, Butler, etc.), and phenomenological (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, etc.), though there is much cross-pollination. The first is characterised by the metaphysical tenor of its critique, proposing some form of materialist monism as an alternative to the dualisms of Plato and Descartes. The second is characterised by its focus upon social dynamics, providing an analysis of the way bodies are “ensouled” by the internalisation of patterns of thought and action. But the last provides the greatest point of overlap with the explanatory concerns discussed above, as it provides a detailed introspective analysis of the body’s involvement in the constitution of experience. Phenomenology has had a marked influence on 4E approaches to cognition, and is responsible for the concept that straddles and sometimes connects all these varying concerns, namely, “the lived body”.</p></div><div id="comp-kiemep6b" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>The idea of the lived body suggests that the body is not just a causal bridge between ourselves and the world, but rather that the body is our engagement with the world in a way that serves as a condition for the emergence of our subjectivity. This suggests that only a “proper” body will be fit for this purpose – no ersatz or artificial alternative will do. Embodiment is in fact “real meat” embodiment. Is this a fair picture, both in phenomenology and in the other frameworks you discuss above?</span></p>



<p>Though not every proponent of embodiment will go so far as to insist on an essential link between mind and meat, I think it’s fair to say that this is where the rhetoric of embodiment leads. To some extent, this is because it aligns with other philosophical and political goals, such as undermining pernicious distinctions between human and animal or diagnosing dangerous fantasies implicit in the very suggestion that minds could be uploaded into computer simulations. However, there are some arguments for the claim, and I’ll try to tease out the general pattern of these as I see it. But first, it’s worth saying something more about the idea of the lived body.</p>



<p>The cornerstone of the phenomenological tradition is the idea that the<span> content</span> of explicitly articulated representations, such as declarative sentences or mathematical models, depends upon a more primitive form of <span>meaning</span> implicit in ordinary conscious experience. This gets formulated in slightly different ways by Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, but they essentially agree that our many and varied representations are able to pick out the same <span>object</span> (e.g., galaxies, spleens, recessions) across changes in time, shifts in perspective, differences of opinion, and diverging interests, only because the referential frameworks they deploy (e.g., star charts, anatomy, econometrics), are so many layers arranged on top of those simple <span>unities</span> that tie together our everyday activities (e.g., places, obstacles, tools). My coffee cup is unified as something I can reach out and grasp, but this grasping is not a carefully planned sequence of muscle movements guided by a mechanical understanding of shapes and forces, it is a single fluid movement in which my fingers fit themselves to the cup’s contours without so much as a second thought. What distinguishes the “lived body” from the “biological body” is not simply that it is not yet an object of scientific representation, but rather that it is what ties everything together in the last instance. It is the <span>origin</span> of all intentional …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently I've come to know the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> while watching a lecture of the course <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/">Intro to Database Systems</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> on database storage. One of the main problems a database storage engine has to solve is <strong>how to deal with data in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. At a higher level, the main purpose of a disk-oriented storage engine is to manipulate data files in a disk. But if we assume that the data in the disk will eventually get bigger than the available memory, we cannot simply load the whole data file into memory, do the change, and write it back to disk.</p><p>This is not a new problem in Computer Science. When operational systems were being developed in the early 1960s, a similar problem was faced: <strong>how can we run programs stored in disk that are larger than the available memory?</strong> A solution to this problem was made by a group in Manchester, implemented on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(computer)">Atlas Computer</a>, in 1961. It was called <em>virtual memory</em>. The <em>virtual memory</em> gives a running program the illusion that it has big enough memory, despite the fact that the computer does not have enough.</p><p>We are not going to go deep on how <em>virtual memory</em> works. Just have in mind that when a program is accessing memory it is accessing the <em>virtual memory</em>. And maybe the data the program is trying to access is not actually in memory, but it does not matter. The operational system will make pretend that it is by going to disk, and putting it there, and replace an old chunk of memory that is not going to be used.</p><p>So, one of the ways a database storage engine can solve the larger than memory problem is to make use of <em>virtual memory</em> and the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong>.</p><p>In Linux, we can make this use by using the system call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> that lets you map a file, no matter how big, directly into memory. If your program needs to manipulate the file, all it needs is to manipulate the memory. The operating system handles the writes to disk for you.</p><p>In some occasions, programmers find this method more convenient than the usual system calls: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close</a>.</p><h3 id="a-simple-demonstration">A simple demonstration</h3><p>Here is a small example of how you can take advantage of this in Go using the package <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>:</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"os"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go"
)

func main() {
	f, _ := os.OpenFile("./file", os.O_RDWR, 0644)
	defer f.Close()
	
	mmap, _ := mmap.Map(f, mmap.RDWR, 0 )
	defer mmap.Unmap()
	fmt.Println(string(mmap))
	
	mmap[0] = 'X'
	mmap.Flush()
}</code></pre><figure><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/pRS8PvTRHksnCVQgSOWvPBF3a.svg" alt="asciicast"></figure><p>The beauty is that we could have a much bigger file, and the solution would still work. We would not have to worry about managing memory in order to avoid it filling up.</p><h3 id="detailing-mmap-capabilites">Detailing <em>mmap</em> capabilites</h3><p>We're going to explore more <em>mmap</em> functionalities from the point of view of the API provided by <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>. There are probably more features that the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix#Mmap">native syscall</a> provides that this library does not implement.</p><h4 id="the-prot-argument">The <code>prot</code> argument</h4><p>Here is the <code>mmap.Map</code> signature</p><pre><code>func Map(f *os.File, prot, flags int) (MMap, error) 
</code></pre><p>Let's look at <code>prot</code> first. The <code>prot</code> argument lets you specify the protection levels of your mapping: <code>RDONLY</code>, <code>RDWR</code>, <code>EXEC</code> are the options provided for <code>mmap-go</code>. These levels are pretty straightforward, <code>RDONLY</code> means you can only read from the mapping, <code>RDWR</code> means you can also write, and <code>EXEC</code> means you can execute code on that mapping. &nbsp;Here is the description of <code>prot</code> from the Linux <code>man</code>:</p><pre><code>The prot argument describes the desired memory protection of the
mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file).
It is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or more of the
following flags:

PROT_EXEC
    Pages may be executed.

PROT_READ
    Pages may be read.

PROT_WRITE
    Pages may be written.

PROT_NONE
    Pages may not be accessed.
</code></pre><p>In the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix">unix package</a>, those flags are: <code>unix.PROT_EXEC</code>, <code>unix.PROT_READ</code>, <code>unix.PROT_WRITE</code> and <code>unix.PROT_NONE</code>.</p><h4 id="experimenting-with-prot_exec-flag">Experimenting with <code>PROT_EXEC</code> flag</h4><p>I've become intrigued by the <code>EXEC</code> flag and wanted to see an example of how that works. I've Google and could not find any example. So I tried a search in Github by <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and found a good example in <code>C</code>: <a href="https://github.com/onesmash/MMapExecDemo">MMapExecDemo</a>. I replicated this example in <code>Go</code> using <code>mmap-go</code>.</p><p>The first step was to create a function that I wanted to be put in memory by <code>mmap</code> allocation, compile it, and get its assembly opcodes.</p><p>I created the <code>inc</code> function in <code>inc.go</code> file</p><pre><code>package inc

func inc(n int) int {
	return n + 1
}

</code></pre><p>compiled it with <code>go tool compile -S -N inc.go</code>, then got its assembly by calling <code>go tool objdump -S inc.o</code>.</p><pre><code>func inc(n int) int {
  0x22b                 48c744241000000000      MOVQ $0x0, 0x10(SP)
        return n + 1
  0x234                 488b442408              MOVQ 0x8(SP), AX
  0x239                 48ffc0                  INCQ AX
  0x23c                 4889442410              MOVQ AX, 0x10(SP)
  0x241                 c3                      RET
</code></pre><p>With this, we can build represent our function in bytes on our code</p><pre><code>code := []byte{
        0x48, 0xc7, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
		0x48, 0x8b, 0x44, 0x24, 0x08,
		0x48, 0xff, 0xc0,
		0x48, 0x89, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10,
		0xc3,
}
</code></pre><p>We allocate our memory with <code>mmap</code>.</p><pre><code>memory, err := mmap.MapRegion(nil, len(code), mmap.EXEC|mmap.RDWR, mmap.ANON, 0)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
</code></pre><p>In this call, we're using a more complete function called <code>MapRegion</code> that lets you specify how much memory you are allocating (<code>Map</code> allocates the size of the underlying file) and the offset of the file.</p><p>In the beginning, we said that the main purpose of <code>mmap</code> was to create a mapping between a file and memory. But in this call we are not indicating any file. <code>mmap</code> can be used just a regular memory allocater by setting <code>nil</code> to the <code>*os.File</code> argument and <code>mmap.ANON</code> to the <code>flags</code> argument. We will talk about more <code>mmap.ANON</code>. Since we are not mapping any file, the offset is <code>0</code>.</p><p>So we have memory allocated with the same size of our code <code>len(code)</code>. Since we set the flag <code>mmap.RDWR</code>, we can copy our <code>code</code> to <code>memory</code>.</p><pre><code>copy(memory, code)
</code></pre><p>We have the code of our <code>inc</code> function in memory. In order to execute it, we have to cast that memory address to a function with a signature that matches the signature of our compiled <code>inc</code>.</p><pre><code>memory_ptr := &amp;memory
ptr := unsafe.Pointer(&amp;memory_ptr)
inc := *(*func(int) int)(ptr)
</code></pre><p>When we call <code>inc</code>, we are executing the code we put in memory. That only works because of the flag <code>mmap.EXEC</code>. If that flag was not set, a <code>segmentation violation</code> would occur.</p><pre><code>fmt.Println(inc(10)) // Prints 11
</code></pre><p>I don't know if this is a real use case. I just wanted to see what it meant to execute code that you put in memory. And there are probably other ways of achieving the same with regular memory allocation and calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a>.</p><p>One question that may come up is: but the code is already in the <code>code</code> variable, can't we just execute it? No, because the memory static allocated to <code>code</code> is not executable. Can we make it executable? I've tried to use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a> on it but still got <code>segmentation violation</code>.</p><p>Here is the full working <a href="https://gist.github.com/brunoac/b9ff4ad46c27926e5e4f078133d0de79">gist</a>.</p><h4 id="the-flags-argument">The <code>flags</code> argument</h4><p>We can have many processes mapping the same memory region. This argument lets us decide about the visibility of the updates happening in the mapping. There are many flags, and you can check them out at <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>. The important ones are <code>unix.MAP_SHARED</code>, <code>unix.MAP_PRIVATE</code> and <code>unix.MAP_ANON</code>.</p><p><code>MAP_SHARED</code> means that changes to the mapping are visible to all processes and will also occur at the underlying mapped file, although we cannot control when.</p><p><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> means the changes are private and other processes will not see them. And also, they are not carried through to the underlying file.</p><p><code>MAP_ANON</code> means that there is not going to be a mapped file. It is useful for sub-processes communication with shared memory.</p><p>I've got confused about the <code>mmap-go</code> library implementation. It only provides the <code>mmap.ANON</code> flag, that we used in the above example. If you want your mapping to be private, you can set the <code>mmap.COPY</code> flag to the <code>prot</code> argument. Anyways, you can always use the flags provided by the <code>unix</code> package implementation.</p><h4 id="locking-and-flushing">Locking and flushing</h4><p>Two other nice methods, <code>Lock</code> and <code>Flush</code>, are provided by the API of <code>mmap-go</code>. The <code>Lock</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a> system call that prevents the mapping to be paged out to disk. And the <code>Flush</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msync.2.html">msync</a> system call that forces the data in memory to be written to disk. This is a good way to trying to have more control over how and when data is flushed to disk.</p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3><p>I felt kind of stupid of knowing about <code>mmap</code> after so long. I don't remember it being brought in my college class. For some reason, I felt amazed by it and its capabilities and decided to dig deeper. I like databases and I'm aiming to get a better grasp of them. This means that <code>mmap</code> cannot go unnoticed from my learning. For future posts, I'll try to bring about the benefits and drawbacks of using <code>mmap</code>, which projects use it, and what kind of problems it is suited for.</p><p>Even though the <code>mmap</code> can be used to solve that database problem we stated in the beginning, and many modern databases use it, <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> advocates against it and have three lecture on how to databases, that don't use <code>mmap</code>, manage data.</p><p>If you like this kind of content, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/brunocalza">twitter</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two parts due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. ENTSO-E has published the first information on the event already on 8 January 2021, followed by an update with geographical view and time sequence on 15 January 2021. Since then, ENTSO-E has analysed a large portion of relevant data aiming to reconstruct the event in detail.</p><p>This second update presents the key findings of detailed analyses, which have a preliminary character subject to new facts, which will emerge in the still ongoing investigation.</p><p>The analysed sequence of events concludes that the initial event was the tripping of a 400 kV busbar coupler in the substation Ernestinovo (Croatia) by overcurrent protection at 14:04:25.9. This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded. At 14:04:48.9, the line Subotica – Novi Sad (Serbia) tripped due to overcurrent protection. This was followed by the further tripping of lines due to distance protection, as shown in Figure 2, below, leading eventually to the system separation into two parts at 14:05:08.6.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f409f977d1a2b6c2df1e49861416d463445808b0/06d80/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-3.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The route where the two parts of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area were separated is shown in Figure 3 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/de60ebc1aaeb673286f78d35b23db319639b40f6/35e86/assets/graphics/uploads/thrid.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>The system separation resulted in a deficit of power (approx. -6.3 GW) in the North-West Area and a surplus of power (approx. +6.3 GW) in the South-East Area, resulting in turn in a frequency decrease in the North-West Area and a frequency increase in the South-East Area.</p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds before quickly reaching a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I migrated this website from Gatsby to Next.js. During the migration, I also decided to migrate the content from Markdown to MDX. With the offical guides and resources I struggled a bit to set this up in a proper way. So after figuring all these small bits, I decided to write an article on how you can setup your Next.js page with MDX.</p><p>You can find a small cheat sheet at the end of the article that skips most of the explanations in this article. Also feel free, to check out the example repository containing the actual code here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/igeligel/remote-mdx-next">igeligel/remote-mdx-next</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-mdx"><a href="#what-is-mdx" aria-label="What is MDX"></a>What is MDX</h2><p>If you read this article you probably know Markdown. It is a content format that you can use to style text. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">This markdown cheat sheet</a> shows this quite nicely. A problem for developers was always on how to include more complicated content in these files. Markdown supports HTML in most cases as well, but a problem is that modern development changed.</p><div><pre><div><p>3</p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeComplicatedInteractiveGraph</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>=</span><span>{data}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>Some longer text describing the graph.</span></p></div></pre></div><p>Styles are injected into React components directly or are rendered with styled-components or emotion. Another problem related to that is to use custom components for the markdown text. No one wants to write this for every paragraph:</p><p>Instead in markdown, you should be just able to write</p><p>And it should use a custom paragraph component somehow. Most markdown and MDX rendering engines support that via custom configurations. Some engines had some problems with the interpretation and compilation of styles that we will look at later.</p><p>When looking for solutions regarding MDX, you will most likely find this blog article: "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown">Markdown/MDX with Next.js</a>" by Lee Robinson. The blog article is really good but fails at some point. The problems appear with “Remote Markdown and MDX” which will be covered now. For that, we need to set up a quick project. So let me run you through.</p><h2 id="creating-the-next.js-project"><a href="#creating-the-next.js-project" aria-label="Creating the Next.js Project"></a>Creating the Next.js Project</h2><p>Since we will create the base ourselves and will use TypeScript, I will explain how to setup a basic TypeScript/Next.js project as well. You can find the documentation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs">here</a>.</p><div><pre><div><p>4</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> next react react-dom</span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion</span></p></div><div><p>6</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gray-matter @mdx-js/react @mdx-js/runtime</span></p></div><div><p>7</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> -D typescript @types/react and @types/node @types/mdx-js__react</span></p></div></pre></div><p>Next, we need to add some commands to our package.json file.</p><p>Now we can start creating a page. Let us create a folder called pages first. In the folder, a file should be created that is called index.tsx. The content should be like this:</p><div><pre><div><p>2</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>This</span><span> </span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>Home</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>That should render a home page on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://localhost:3000/">localhost:3000</a>.</p><figure><p><img alt="Webview of a basic home page" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9122d2236f9f6d2728d24b6136d15b7000da8a8c/0a803/remote-mdx-first-screen.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Webview of a basic home page</figcaption></figure><h2 id="laying-out-the-different-pages"><a href="#laying-out-the-different-pages" aria-label="Laying out the different pages"></a>Laying out the different pages</h2><p>So you are probably reading this article to get to know how MDX is now rendered. As explained in the official blog article linked above, MDX can be rendered in different ways. If you really just have static pages and do not really care about layouting feel free to use the mentioned approach in the documentation. My setup was a bit more sophisticated. So let us focus on what we want to achieve:</p><figure><p><img alt="Architecture of the MDX remote rendering application" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/54789238a3d3e24a87ded377869340f0fa293d74/c0173/remote-mdx-1.svg" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Architecture of the MDX remote rendering application</figcaption></figure><p>So there is a generic post page. The generic in this sense means that Next.js is actually doing something during the generation phase of the HTML to check if a path is valid. The feature is called dynamic routes and documentation can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes">here</a>.</p><p>So the workflow for our page should be similar to this:</p><ol role="list"><li><span>User opens <code>/some-random-path</code></span></li><li><span>Our server looks up if it can find <code>some-random-path.mdx</code></span></li><li><span>If successful, it will render the MDX as HTML and send it to the client</span></li></ol><p>The unhappy path can be done by responding with a 404, but this will already happen if you decide to statically export the pages which we will try here.</p><p>So now we can actually start with creating the page. In the pages directory, create another file that is called <code>[post].tsx</code>. The content, for now, should look like the following:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"next"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Test</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>7</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>11</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>14</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>There are many things that are different now. So let us focus on some parts first. First we should look at what functions are defined here:</p><ul role="list"><li><p><span><code>Post</code>: This our usual Page React component.</span></p></li><li><p><span><code>getStaticProps</code>: This function is normally used to fetch data. This data is getting fetched during build time. So normally during your deployment. After the deployment this data will not changed. It is static.</span></p></li><li><p><span><code>getStaticPaths</code>: This functionality is needed when using <code>getStaticProps</code>, so Next.js knows for which paths it should generate data. This is because the component name is <code>[post].tsx</code>. The <code>[post]</code> is the placeholder for all URLs you define under <code>getStaticPaths</code>.</span></p></li><li><p><span><code>export default Post</code>: Just the <code>Post</code> React component exported.</span></p></li></ul><p>So in our example, you should start looking at the exported object in <code>getStaticPaths</code>:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>The two highlighted lines are the exported paths for this component. This means <code>[post].tsx</code> actually relates to <code>/some-random-path</code> and <code>alternative-random-path</code>. The important part here is to have the key in the object named the same as the file it will relate to. Something like the following will <strong>not</strong> work:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> slug</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> slug</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>So what happens is that Next.js exports the returned object from <code>getStaticPaths</code> and pass this object to the <code>getStaticProps</code> function as the <code>props</code> parameter. This will enable us to read the <code>post</code> property inside the <code>getStaticProps</code> function. That is great, because it will enable us to query the MDX and meta information about the page.</p><h2 id="getting-that-mdx-and-passing-it-to-the-component"><a href="#getting-that-mdx-and-passing-it-to-the-component" aria-label="Getting that MDX and passing it to the component"></a>Getting that MDX and passing it to the component</h2><p>Now we have a setup where <code>getStaticProps</code> has access to the <code>post</code> parameter. Its actually time to get the MDX. So currently we have the following folder structure:</p><p>Let us create another directory, called <code>content</code>. Inside there we create two files: <code>some-random-path.mdx</code>, <code>alternative-random-path.mdx</code>. The whole directory structure should look like the following:</p><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>alternative-random-path.mdx</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><p>Both of these files should have some content now. For simplicity let us just enter a heading and a small paragraph like the following:</p><h3 id="some-random-path.mdx"><a href="#some-random-path.mdx" aria-label="some-random-path.mdx"></a>some-random-path.mdx</h3><h3 id="alternative-random-path.mdx"><a href="#alternative-random-path.mdx" aria-label="alternative-random-path.mdx"></a>alternative-random-path.mdx</h3><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span># Alternative Random Path</span></p></div><div><p>3</p><p><span>Some politician is really nice.</span></p></div></pre></div><p>So now that there is content we can begin to read that MDX content and pass it to the proper component. To understand how this works, let us have another look at the <code>getStaticProps</code> function. Currently, this function just returns an object with the property <code>props</code> that is empty. The object in <code>props</code> will be then passed to the component <code>Post</code> and is available when the component is being rendered. So let us assumed the following:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>2</p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"next"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>  someTestProperty</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>8</p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>FC</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PostProps</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>9</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>someTestProperty</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>12</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>      someTestProperty</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Hello World"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>In that case, you can clearly see how <code>someTestProperty</code> is being passed to the component to be actually rendered in the page. For that just open <code>http://localhost:3000/some-random-path</code>:</p><figure><p><img alt="A screenshot from the Hello World page" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ddd447e7f61ab163ea5f6eca7a6ce548edf6c5d8/e603e/remote-mdx-second-screen.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>A screenshot from the Hello World page</figcaption></figure><p>So if this works, we can also read the MDX in that function and pass it to the component. We can use the node packages <code>fs</code> and <code>path</code> to read the actual content and pass it to the component. Remember you need to call <code>toString()</code> in this case because an MDX file by itself is not serializable. We are just doing it in this step to make it work. The component should look like the following then:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>3</p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> path </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"path"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"next"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>10</p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>FC</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PostProps</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>11</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>mdx</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>14</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> folderPath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"content"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>16</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> filePath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>folderPath</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>}</span><span>.mdx</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>18</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> source </span><span>=</span><span> fs</span><span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>filePath</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>21</p><p><span>      mdx</span><span>:</span><span> source</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>26</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>29</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>30</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>That will now just render the MDX as text. Nothing we want. But hey, we got the first part working. Passing the MDX content to the frontend. You can view the content on <code>http://localhost:3000/some-random-path</code></p><figure><p><img alt="A screenshot showin the raw MDX content rendered as text in a web page" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9112a7a82fd838f12574d296dc11e5a7d9af62c2/b8e7d/remote-mdx-third-screen.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>A screenshot showin the raw MDX content rendered as text in a web page</figcaption></figure><h3 id="reading-meta-information"><a href="#reading-meta-information" aria-label="Reading Meta information"></a>Reading Meta information</h3><p>MDX and Markdown both support the Meta information tag inside the content files. You can simply define it with like the following:</p><div><pre><div><p>2</p><p><span>seoTitle: "This is a nice title"</span></p></div></pre></div><p>As you can see the first part is denoted by <code>---</code>. This means that this is the meta information and actually should not appear in our rendered page. We need to extract it. Fortunately, someone has solved this already for us. Simply install <code>gray-matter</code>:</p><p>That dependency is exporting a simple function that takes the MDX source code and splits it into two parts: The meta information and the actual content. So let us change our <code>getStaticProps</code> function. Hint: You might need to adjust types as well.</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> matter </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"gray-matter"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>6</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> folderPath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"content"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>7</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> filePath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>folderPath</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>}</span><span>.mdx</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>8</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> rawFileSource </span><span>=</span><span> fs</span><span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>filePath</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>10</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> content</span><span>,</span><span> data </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>matter</span><span>(</span><span>rawFileSource</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>      metaInformation</span><span>:</span><span> data</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>That should also return us the meta information. …</p></div></div>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>
<p>The source code is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

							<p><em>TLDR: DuckDB now has full-text search functionality, similar to the FTS5 extension in SQLite. The main difference is that our FTS extension is fully formulated in SQL. We tested it out on TREC disks 4 and 5.</em></p>

<p>Searching through textual data stored in a database can be cumbersome, as SQL does not provide a good way of formulating questions such as “Give me all the documents about <strong>Mallard Ducks</strong>”: string patterns with <code>LIKE</code> will only get you so far. Despite SQL’s shortcomings here, storing textual data in a database is commonplace. Consider the table <code>products (id INT, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR</code>) - it would be useful to search through the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> columns for a website that sells these products.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We expect a search engine to return us results within milliseconds. For a long time databases were unsuitable for this task, because they could not search large inverted indices at this speed: transactional database systems are not made for this use case. However, analytical database systems, can keep up with state-of-the art information retrieval systems. The company <a href="https://www.spinque.com/">Spinque</a> is a good example of this. At Spinque, MonetDB is used as a computation engine for customized search engines.</p>

<p>DuckDB’s FTS implementation follows the paper “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/SIGIR2014-column-stores-ir-prototyping.pdf">Old Dogs Are Great at New Tricks</a>”. A keen observation there is that advances made to the database system, such as parallelization, will speed up your search engine “for free”!</p>

<p>Alright, enough about the “why”, let’s get to the “how”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h3>
<p>The TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track has 250 “topics” (search queries) over TREC disks 4 and 5. The data consist of many text files stored in SGML format, along with a corresponding DTD (document type definition) file. This format is rarely used anymore, but it is similar to XML. We will use OpenSP’s command line tool <code>osx</code> to convert it to XML. Because there are many files, I wrote a bash script:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> latimes/xml
<span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq</span> <span>-w</span> 1 9<span>)</span>
<span>do
        </span><span>cat </span>dtds/la.dtd latimes-<span>$i</span> | osx <span>&gt;</span> latimes/xml/latimes-<span>$i</span>.xml
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sorts the <code>latimes</code> files. Repeat for the <code>fbis</code>, <code>cr</code>, <code>fr94</code>, and <code>ft</code> files.</p>

<p>To parse the XML I used BeautifulSoup. Each document has a <code>docno</code> identifier, and a <code>text</code> field. Because the documents do not come from the same source, they differ in what other fields they have. I chose to take all of the fields.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>import</span> <span>multiprocessing</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>import</span> <span>re</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have a dataframe, we can register it in DuckDB.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create database connection and register the dataframe
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'documents_df'</span><span>,</span> <span>documents_df</span><span>)</span>

<span># create a table from the dataframe so that it persists
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"CREATE TABLE documents AS (SELECT * FROM documents_df)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is the end of my preparation script, so I closed the database connection.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-search-engine">Building the Search Engine</h3>
<p>We can now build the inverted index and the retrieval model using a <code>PRAGMA</code> statement. The extension is <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/full_text_search">documented here</a>. We create an index table on table <code>documents</code> or <code>main.documents</code> that we created with our script. The column that identifies our documents is called <code>docno</code>, and we wish to create an inverted index on the fields supplied. I supplied all fields by using the ‘*’ shortcut.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"PRAGMA create_fts_index('documents', 'docno', '*', stopwords='english')"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, a parameterized SQL script is called. The schema <code>fts_main_documents</code> is created, along with tables <code>docs</code>, <code>terms</code>, <code>dict</code>, and <code>stats</code>, that make up the inverted index. If you’re curious what this look like, take a look at our source code under the <code>extension</code> folder in DuckDB’s source code!</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The data is now fully prepared. Now we want to run the queries in the benchmark, one by one. We load the topics file as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># the 'topics' file is not structured nicely, therefore we need parse some of it using regex
</span><span>def</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>):</span>
    <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>'&lt;'</span> <span>+</span> <span>tag</span> <span>+</span> <span>r</span><span>'&gt;([\s\S]*?)&lt;.*&gt;'</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>m</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>()</span>

<span>topic_dict</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'../../trec/topics'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>bs_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>bs</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(),</span> <span>"lxml"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>top</span> <span>in</span> <span>bs_content</span><span>.</span><span>findChildren</span><span>(</span><span>'top'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>top_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>()</span>
        <span># we need the number and title of each topic
</span>        <span>num</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'num'</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>' '</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'title'</span><span>)</span>
        <span>topic_dict</span><span>[</span><span>num</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>title</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This gives us a dictionary that has query number as keys, and query strings as values, e.g. <code>301 -&gt; 'International Organized Crime'</code>.</p>

<p>We want to store the results in a specific format, so that they can be evaluated by <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git">trec eval</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create a prepared statement to make querying our document collection easier

        SELECT docno, score
        FROM scored_docs
        WHERE score IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY score DESC
        LIMIT 1000)
    """</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Now that we have created our ‘results’ file, we can compare them to the relevance assessments <code>qrels</code> using <code>trec_eval</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./trec_eval <span>-m</span> P.30 <span>-m</span> map qrels results
map                     all 0.2324
P_30                    all 0.2948
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad! While these results are not as high as the reproducible by <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md">Anserini</a>, they are definitely acceptable. The difference in performance can be explained by differences in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which stemmer was used (we used ‘porter’)</li>
  <li>Which stopwords were used (we used the list of 571 English stopwords used in the SMART system)</li>
  <li>Pre-processing (removal of accents, punctuation, numbers)</li>
  <li>BM25 parameters (we used the default k=1.2 and b=0.75, non-conjunctive)</li>
  <li>Which fields were indexed (we used all columns by supplying ‘*’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieval time for each query was between 0.5 and 1.3 seconds on our machine, which will be improved with further improvements to DuckDB. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, and become inspired to test out the extension as well!</p>

<div><p>Neumorphism is a recent breakaway from the more common Skeuomorphic designs, one which focuses on the colour palette. What this helps achieve is a realistic, physical feel to the product along with an appealing visual quality that makes the product feel more ‘real.’ </p><p>Here’s how it looks like on CRED</p></div>

<h3><span>How it all began</span></h3>
<p><span>Experimentation is the way of life at CRED. Neumorphism is an aesthetic style that only came into the design scene over a year back. It piqued the interest of a few of our designers, and as a side project, they made mockups of CRED based on this aesthetic. Long story short: we just loved how beautiful our product look with this aesthetic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While similar stories would have ended there, we saw this as a good enough reason to turn it from an experiment into a full-fledged project; to not just have a few screens but the entire product adopt the Neumorphic aesthetic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Equal amounts exciting and difficult. That’s how we know an experiment is worth pursuing and this one ticked off both.</span></p>
<h3><span>The process</span></h3>
<p><span>Scaling the designs to the entirety of the product did crop up some problems. Since this design philosophy is heavily dependent on visual aesthetics, we had to optimize for lights, shadows, gradients, and more in our framework. The fixes compounded, and now we have a framework that is incredibly stable and consistent throughout the product.</span></p>
<p><span>Just like we picked up Neumorphism, we wanted to have a design system in place that would make it easier for us to adopt and experiment with any other design philosophy in the future. Our new design system does just this: With the upgrade, our mobile framework could evolve into an array of offerings that we wished to build. And as an engineering framework, it also enables us to put any skin over our defined template engine making sure iterations come easy for both design and engineering teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The next step: open sourcing the library</span></h3>
<p><span>Adopting Neumorphism was a successful experiment for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But we realize the current restrictions on implementing it are stopping others from experimenting with this design philosophy. And we believe this is depriving the world of so many great product experiences.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe the way forward for Neumorphism won’t be decided by us, but the world’s design community, which is why we are making Synth, our UI framework for implementing Neumorphic designs, open-source.</span></p>
<p><span>With this release, anyone in the world can use this framework to implement Neumorphic designs throughout their product and do it at scale. The possibilities for Synth’s use are endless, and at CRED, we are excited to see all of them.<br></span></p>

							<p>Today, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK (€ 9 600 000) fine to the dating app Grindr, as a result of a legal complaint filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council. </p><p>- This is a milestone in the ongoing work to ensure that consumers’ privacy is protected online. The Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has clearly established that it is unacceptable for companies to collect and share personal data without user´s permission, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the Norwegian Consumer Council said.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-study-the-advertising-industry-is-systematically-breaking-the-law/">revealed how many apps collect and share large amounts of sensitive information</a> without users’ knowledge. Based on these findings, the Consumer Council filed legal complaints, together with&nbsp;noyb, the European Center for Digital Right,&nbsp;against the dating app Grindr and five commercial partners for breaches of the&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The Data Protection Authority has now upheld the Consumer Council’s&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intention-to-issue--10-million-fine-to-grindr-llc/">issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK&nbsp;</a>(€ 9 600 000)&nbsp;one-time&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;fine, which amounts to 10 percent of Grindr’s global annual revenue.&nbsp;Grindr has until February 15th&nbsp;to provide comments or remarks&nbsp;on the decision.</p>

<p>-  This is excellent news and sends a clear signal that it’s illegal to monitor consumers without their consent 24/7 to collect and share their data. The GDPR does have teeth and consumer groups stand ready to act against those who break the law, Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), said.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">– The message is simple: ‘take it or leave it’ is not consent. If you rely on unlawful ‘consent’ you are subject to a hefty fine.

January 25, 2021 | https://figbert.com/posts/remarkable-tablet/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://figbert.com/posts/remarkable-tablet/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, there’s been renewed interest in clean, simple technology
built to help us focus. Protocols like <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> strip away
the chaos of the web. Hardware hackers fit screens in
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/smarter-mirrors-and-how-theyre-made-327997b9eff7">mirrors</a> and build beautiful minimalist displays to
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494">read the news</a>, display data neatly in a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/meet-accent-352cfa95813a">picture
frame</a>, or provide a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://healeycodes.com/hacking-together-an-e-ink-dashboard/">daily summary</a>. Hidden amongst
these many awesome projects is the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable 2</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the reMarkable for the past month or so and it is a
seriously solid device. I use it mainly to take notes, at which it
excels. The e-ink display is the best I have ever seen, barely ever
refreshing the entire screen and almost entirely without the temporary
artifacts that plague similar devices. The pencil is comfortable to
use – slightly fuzzy – and, interestingly, entirely passive: it never
needs to charge. Given that it’s meant to replace your paper, it
shouldn’t be too surprising that the tablet’s also incredibly thin.</p>
<h2 id="cornellnotes"><a href="#cornellnotes" aria-label="Anchor link for: cornellnotes">##
</a>
cornellNotes</h2>
<p>In one of my classes, I’m required to take Cornell notes. On what may
be a related note, it’s a terrible class. Regardless, I need to get an
A and so notes I shall take. The reMarkable comes with a built-in
Cornell notes template. It’s slightly different than the format I’m
used to, but it fits the bill well enough.</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the experience of using the device. I would
say that it feels shockingly natural. Using it to take notes feels
like writing on a clipboard with none of the usual annoyances – the
paper sliding, having finite pages; and all the benefits of a digital
device – sending files via email, OCR, a select-and-drag tool, etc.
It’s convenient, feels nice, and performs well. Most importantly, it
makes me <em>excited</em> to use it every time I turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="worksheet"><a href="#worksheet" aria-label="Anchor link for: worksheet">##
</a>
workSheet</h2>
<p>In another class, the instructor distributes worksheets every once in
a while to complete during class. Now that we’re in distance learning
due to COVID, these are <code>pdf</code>s – perfect for use with the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I download them onto my laptop, upload them through the app, and
voila. Look Mom, no scratch paper! I can write directly on the
worksheet. I’ve only started doing it this week, and it’s amazing.
Sure, there are programs on the computer that allow you to write
on a <code>pdf</code>, but doing math with a trackpad sounds like torture. With
the reMarkable, it’s enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s the device’s biggest impact. I used to hate writing by hand.
I would beg my teachers to let me type assignments so I didn’t have
to use a pencil – what am I, a caveman? Now, my paper has superpowers.</p>
<h2 id="notkindle"><a href="#notkindle" aria-label="Anchor link for: notkindle">##
</a>
notKindle</h2>
<p>It’s also a suprisingly good reading device, with native support for
<code>epub</code>s and <code>pdf</code>s. It doesn’t have a backlight, but to be fair
neither do actual books so I’m not too bothered. The default font size
is quite large, and the UI is really minimal which makes for peaceful,
undistracted reading. I own two Kindles already, but I’ve taken to
using the reMarkable instead for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no ads or tracking. On Kindle there’s an ad on the bottom
of the homescreen, which expands to the whole screen when you turn it
off – plus it sends every move you make to live forever with Big Papa
Bezos. Not so with the reMarkable.</li>
<li>The screen on the reMarkable is physically larger. Though sometimes
the compact size of my Kindle comes in handy, like when traveling,
having a nice big display is definitely an advantage. My Kindle is
closer to a large phone, and the reMarkable is definitely a tablet.</li>
<li>The reMarkable is a fairly open device. The Kindle, on the other
hand, is locked down and dripping with DRM (fairly easy to break but
still an encumberance).</li>
</ol>
<p>The developers have also made a browser extension for Chromium-based
browsers called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh">Read on reMarkable</a>, which I would love to see
the insides of but is unfortunately closed-source. Basically, it takes
any webpage, turns it into an <code>epub</code>, and sends it off to your device.
I love it and use it near constantly: whenever I run into anything on
HN that is either really long, or I just want to save for later, I
hit a button and it sends it to the tablet. Again, just incredibly
convenient.</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak"><a href="#jailbreak" aria-label="Anchor link for: jailbreak">##
</a>
jailBreak</h2>
<p>This section is titled “jailbreak,” which is actually a bit of
misnomer because the reMarkable runs Linux and you can <code>ssh</code> into it
with ease. It’s also not too fitting because I’m not just going to
talk about modifying the device, but also about official accessories.
My device came with a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/folios">Book Folio</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/markers">Marker</a> in the
box, which is pretty good value. I did find out while writing this
that they offer a “Marker Plus” that comes with a built-in eraser. It
is, unfortunately, out of stock currently but I plan on buying it once
it returns in “January 2021,” so supposedly sometime in the next week
or so.</p>
<p>Ok now time for the jailbreak-y stuff. There’s an active community on
Freenode, an unofficial <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">wiki</a>, and an <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable">Awesome list</a>.
All of these are really great resources for cool stuff you can do with
your device, and I’m planning to begin experimenting with them in the
coming weeks. My first goal is to get <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader">KOReader</a> running so I
can sync my extensive Calibre library to the device. I’m going to
avoid adding any <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable#games">games</a> so as not to add additional complexity
to a device that aims to remove distractions, and proceed slowly so I
don’t brick my fancy new toy. Stick around to see how that goes.</p>
<h2 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="Anchor link for: ps">##
</a>
pS</h2>
<p>The recently published fairly viral <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/index.html">Ditherpunk article</a>
by <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> gives a really interesting overview of image
dithering. After reading the article, I noticed that the reMarkable
itself uses dithering to “fade off” your writing and make it look
like pencil. Neat.</p>
<p>Also, comparing the reMarkable to the Kindle makes me want to
jailbreak that too – I’ll find some time to look into that soon.</p>

<p>- Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr has shared user data to a number of third parties without legal basis, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<p>Grindr is a location-based social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people. In 2020, <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/complaints-against-grindr-and-five-third-party-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint against Grindr</a> claiming unlawful sharing of personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. The data shared include GPS location, user profile data, and the fact that the user in question is on Grindr.</p>
<p>Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr needs consent to share these personal data and that Grindr’s consents were not valid. Additionally, we believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection.</p>
<p>- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case. Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data. Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<h2>Invalid consents</h2>
<p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that as a general rule, consent is required for intrusive profiling and tracking practices for marketing or advertising purposes, for example those that involve tracking individuals across multiple websites, locations, devices, services or data-brokering. The same applies where a commercial app wishes to share data concerning users’ sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Users were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety to use the app, and they were not asked specifically if they wanted to consent to the sharing of their data with third parties. Furthermore, the information about the sharing of personal data was not properly communicated to users. We consider that this was contrary to the GDPR requirements for valid consent.</p>
<p>- Grindr is seen as a safe space, and many users wish to be discrete. Nonetheless, their data have been shared with an unknown number of third parties, and any information regarding this was hidden away, Thon added.</p>
<h2>Could result in highest Norwegian DPA fine to date</h2>
<p>An administrative fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>- We have notified Grindr that we intend to impose a fine of high magnitude as our findings suggest grave violations of the GDPR. Grindr has 13.7 million active users, of which thousands reside in Norway. Our view is that these people have had their personal data shared unlawfully. An important objective of the GDPR is precisely to prevent <em>take-it-or-leave-it</em> “consents”. It is imperative that such practices cease, Thon emphasised.</p>
<p>We have found that Grindr has a worldwide annual turnover of at least USD $ 100&nbsp;000&nbsp;000. This means that our proposed fine will constitute approximately 10 % of the company’s turnover.</p>
<p>Our investigation has focused on the consent mechanism in place from the GDPR became applicable until April 2020, when Grindr changed how the app asks for consent. We have not to date assessed whether the subsequent changes comply with the GDPR.</p>
<h2>Not a final decision</h2>
<p>The document we have issued to Grindr is a draft decision. Grindr has been given the opportunity to comment on our findings within 15 February 2021. We will make our final decision once we have assessed any remarks the company may have.</p>
<p>Our draft decision concerns the free version of the Grindr app.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council also filed complaints against five of the third parties receiving data from Grindr: MoPub (owned by Twitter Inc.), Xandr Inc. (formerly known as AppNexus Inc.), OpenX Software Ltd., AdColony Inc., and Smaato Inc. These cases are ongoing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <h2 id="a-single-server">A Single Server</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine a small server running an application out in the wild. The application is small–it requires only a backend server, a database, and some static frontend code–but despite its size, the traffic on this server has been increasing in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>As the traffic continues to grow, response times grow slower and users begin complaining about the application’s slowness. Thankful that the application is seeing increased traffic, the main developer of the application uses a late night to increase CPU and memory on the server (a vertical scale), which succeeds without issue.</p>
<p>This happens a few more times as traffic continues to grow, but soon increasing the VM’s size becomes infeasible; the developer is tired of doing the scaling in the middle of the night and the increasing sizes provide diminishing improvements in response time.</p>
<p>Tired of repeatedly increasing the size of the server, the developer explores the idea of running multiple servers of the same application (horizontal scaling). After discussing it with a few colleagues and reading some articles, the developer remembers why she did the vertical scaling in the first place: the overhead of moving towards horizontally scaled deployment seems annoying. What should the developer do?</p>
<p>If you work or have worked at a company that ships products that people use, this situation might sound familiar. A deployment process that seemed easy and straightforward becomes toilsome and stressful, often spread across numerous servers, creating heavy cognitive load. However, when surveying all the alternatives for horizontal deployments, one can quickly become overwhelmed with the array of options and tools.</p>
<p>So how does a single server become 2, 3, 4+ with the same initial setup? Should one just stick a load balancer between the two instances? Does a simple blue/green deployment with 2+ server instances get the job done? How about using some kind of container deployment service that is triggered every time code is merged into the main branch? What happens if one of the servers goes down?</p>
<p>While the example above is simplistic, it underlines the main point of this article: deploying production-grade applications is inherently challenging. To keep services chugging and meeting expectations, there are many things to keep in mind.</p>
<h2 id="production-application-non-negotiables">Production Application Non-negotiables</h2>
<p>Deploying production-grade applications is a daunting task, and it requires planning for (at least) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking (DNS, IP, certificates, load-balancing, etc.)</li>
<li>Compute (the “server”)</li>
<li>Scaling (vertical &amp; horizontal)</li>
<li>Persistence, Queues, &amp; Key-Value Store</li>
<li>Roles &amp; Policies (who can do what?)</li>
<li>Application Configuration &amp; Secrets</li>
<li>Logging, Alerting, &amp; Health Checking</li>
<li>Packaging, Bundling, Dependencies &amp; Artifacts</li>
<li>Deployments</li>
<li>Other aspects I forgot to include…</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, the items in the list above are production non-negotiables. If the non-negotiables aren’t implemented or implemented poorly, the application won’t run, will become unreachable, or will die without any warning or insight. But the extent to which you “see” these non-negotiables depends on where the application is deployed, and subsequently, how much you are paying for it.</p>
<p>Unless you are running everything on bare metal, on Raspberry Pis in your bedroom/garage, or “on-prem” (😱), your cloud provider likely offers a myriad of services to get your application stood up on their machines.</p>
<p>And this brings us to Kubernetes. Reaching for Kubernetes begins to make sense when faced with the cloud provider mishmash for deploying production applications; instead of cobbling together a rag-tag group of proprietary, cloud-based services, it might be better to harness the power of an open-source, highly-tested, hugely-supported solution built from Google’s internal experience of running highly available services.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has a million descriptions, but at its core, it is a first-class set of objects and APIs that handle a wide range of the production deployment non-negotiables. The fact that Kubernetes is (nearly) the whole package is one reason that all cloud providers offer their form of Kubernetes-as-a-service. Many cloud providers provide their version of hosted services, such as databases, Elasticsearch, Redis, etc. but few services cover the kind of breadth Kubernetes does.</p>
<p>Since Kubernetes is one of the most popular choices for deploying scaled applications, cloud providers build their solutions to plug into the Kubernetes API. This means that creating the same Kubernetes object in clusters on different cloud providers often creates provider-specific resources, all while these resources look the same on the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, let’s say you want to create a load balancer on two clusters that exist in two different cloud providers. In the land of Kubernetes, you might be create a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">“Service” object</a> (which allows different services to reach each other by DNS instead of IP inside the cluster), which might subsequently create a cloud provider-specific, like an application or network load balancer.</p>
<p>But the beauty here is that you are thinking in terms of Kubernetes objects–a Service–and not in terms of AWS application load balancers or Google Cloud Engine GKE Ingress. In the land of the clouds, change is the only constant, and it is difficult to keep up with them. Having a frame of thinking about setup through the lens of Kubernetes objects can be advantageous.</p>

<p>So when should you use Kubernetes? Like everything in software, there are no hard-and-fast rules. That said, the following might be a place to start:</p>
<p><strong>1. Your application has substantial traffic</strong></p>
<p>Kubernetes has many features for handling zero-time deployments and the restarting of non-responsive/unhealthy services. While well-designed services can handle substantial traffic, it can be advantageous to have full control over how zero-downtime deployments will be rolled out.</p>
<p><strong>2. You are using a microservice architecture</strong></p>
<p>If running a microservice architecture, it’s almost guaranteed that these services need to talk to each other. This will likely be a nightmare on Kubernetes, but likely will be an even larger nightmare without it</p>
<p><strong>3. There are problems with your current deployment process–and there are enough resources and will to change it</strong></p>
<p>There will always be issues with an application’s deployment strategy. However, there are times when these issues impact the business side of things. Kubernetes will of course in no automatically solve deployment-related issues (and could possibly even make them worse if the team has too little Kubernetes experience). But if implemented well, Kubernetes can iron out what otherwise might have been a toilsome deployment process.</p>
<p><strong>4. You have a considerable understanding of your application’s needs and how it might best be deployed</strong></p>
<p>What does the application require? Which components should be deployed in the cluster and which should be managed services? If these questions have relatively clear answers, Kubernetes could be an appropriate choice.</p>
<p><strong>5. You want to learn about Kubernetes!</strong></p>
<p>There is no better way to learn about something by doing it, so if you’re curious about Kubernetes, get a cluster running locally and poke around.</p>
<h2 id="the-kubernetes-threshold">The Kubernetes Threshold</h2>
<p>The list above is in no way exhaustive, and in reality, every deployed application is its own snowflake. If you or the company already has guardrails for deploying production applications, and there aren’t huge problems with this existing setup, it is likely prudent to do deploy the “old” way. This assumes that many/all of the production non-negotiables have been met, and the way they are implemented isn’t causing business-critical issues. Sometimes it is enough to simply set up a load balancer and deploying a second VM with an additional instance of your application, for example.</p>
<p>The decision to deploy on Kubernetes, whether it’s managed or not, should not be taken lightly. Understanding the trade-offs between the services/resources necessary for a non-Kubernetes setup vs. those necessary for a Kubernetes setup is paramount before rolling out a new Kubernetes cluster. The point at which it makes “more sense” to deploy on Kubernetes is what we might call the Kubernetes threshold.</p>
<p>Every situation is different, and every situation’s Kubernetes threshold will be different. By considering this as early as possible, it will provide benefits to people on all sides of the application. If your applications aren’t already running on Kubernetes, imagining where your project and organizational Kubernetes threshold lies will benefit you and your team as your work continues.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The training time of a neural network is a topic that is under discussed in machine learning academic literature, but is super important in practice. By making training time faster, one reaps the benefits of (A) reducing their compute budget and (B) being able to test hypothesis faster. </p>



<p>For the purposes of this post, I’m assuming the neural network of interest has already achieved the inference runtime and performance requirements, and now the focus is purely on optimizing the training time. When I am speeding up training time, I usually find myself alternating between solutions that are either primarily software or hardware related.</p>



<h2>Software Solutions</h2>



<h3>1. Optimizer and Schedules</h3>



<p>The software solution that I tune the most is definitely the optimizer and its associated hyper parameters. I find that after almost any other change it is worth double checking that your optimizer and its hyperparameters are still optimal for your new setup.</p>



<p>When first prototyping a network, I prefer to use SGD with a constant learning rate and momentum. This reduces the number of optimizer hyperparameters to just setting the learning rate.</p>



<p>Once a network prototype is achieved, a reliable trick to boost performance is to introduce learning rate step drops when the learning appears to have stalled out. However, determining the exact iteration at which to perform the learning rate step can be nuanced.</p>



<p>I personally have had great success with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120">One Cycle learning rate policy</a>. However, it opens up a lot of new knobs to potentially tune (min/max lr, exact lr curve, etc). I strongly recommend using AdamW + <a href="https://fastai1.fast.ai/callbacks.one_cycle.html">Fast.ai One Cycle schedule</a> (which follows a cosine annealing) as a starting policy and tuning from there.</p>



<h3>2. Initialization</h3>



<p>The proper initialization of a neural network can have a large impact on the training speed. There are three major options:<br>1. <strong>Random initialization</strong>. A standard choice is <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/paper/delving-deep-into-rectifiers-surpassing-human">Kaiming initialization</a> with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002">Focal Loss bias</a>.<br>2. <strong>Pretraining w/ other datasets</strong>. This includes data from other tasks (ie use <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> for backbone pretraining when doing object detection) or from same task but different source (ie always doing object detection, but generalizing from <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a> to <a href="https://www.nuscenes.org/">nuScenes</a>). <br>3. <strong>Pretraining w/ same dataset</strong>. If one has determined that some subset of a dataset is less valuable for training, it could still serve a useful role in pretraining. See next section on Curriculum for ideas on how to determine the usefulness of data.</p>



<h3>3.  Curriculum</h3>



<p>Given a fixed dataset, there is still an open question on the best way to present the data to the neural network. While the default to define an epoch as one random pass through the dataset works great as a starting point, there are lots of potential improvements in the selection and presentation of a curriculum for the neural network.</p>



<p>Some ideas in this area include:<br>1. <strong>Sampling of data</strong>. Not all data samples are equally valuable, for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03195">repeat factor sampling</a> can be used to prioritize rare annotations.<br>2. <strong>Multitask prioritization. </strong>When <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09796">teaching a neural network multiple tasks</a>, one strategy is to teach those tasks from easiest to hardest.<br>3. <strong>Progressive resizing. </strong>When training image based tasks with a fully convolution neural network, one approach is to start with small resolution images and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2018/08/10/fastai-diu-imagenet/">progressively increase the size</a>.</p>



<p>I have found that the effort to reward ratio favors spending a significant amount of time on tuning the curriculum.</p>



<h3>4. Architecture</h3>



<p>Since I am assuming that one has already achieved the required inference runtime, the neural network architecture may not need to be optimized further. However, if you are using a stochastic step during training like <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html">drop out</a>, the removal of this step can significantly speed up your training time. Otherwise, tuning the architecture for training speed is usually not worth a large time investment.</p>



<h2>Hardware Specific Solutions</h2>



<h3>1. Better Hardware</h3>



<p>If you just sit still, your training time likely will go down from the continued advances in CPUs, GPUS, RAM, etc. A great way to set yourself up for these changes is by not owning your own hardware but instead training in the cloud.</p>



<h3>2. Data Serving</h3>



<p>The goal is to keep your GPUs fed, so one should push your non-GPU code to be slightly faster than your GPU step so that your GPUs are always busy. Be prepared to often revisit this step as you make advances in optimizing other parts of your training time. There is no way around it, solving this step is often difficult since there is no one size fits all solution. Instead, you will constantly need to find a nuanced solution that depends on your specific hardware and dataset.</p>



<h3>3. GPU Utilization</h3>



<p>Modern neural network architectures favor 2D CNNs which are highly optimized for GPUs. And if you can show how to simplify a complicated architecture to a 2D CNN, <a href="https://n2infinityandbeyond.com/2019/01/07/pointpillars-fast-encoders-for-object-detection-from-point-clouds/">you might get a paper out of it</a> ;). </p>



<p>So personally I have found the effort to be put into GPU utilization to be highly bimodal. If you have an architecture that is not GPU efficient, go all in on making it more efficient, the rewards are huge! But if you have already optimized for inference runtime, you likely already have a modern architecture that efficiently utilizes GPUs. Once you have the right architecture, then you often only need to make minor tweaks to the batch size to fully utilize the GPU.</p>



<h3>4. Mixed Precision Training</h3>



<p>With the correct hardware, training with mixed precision (float32 and float16) is <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision">an easy way to cut training time in half</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.9/Trainer/Distributed%20training/">modern libraries make it as simple as a single setting</a>. The only catch is that you may make your training more unstable. But if you can tame the extra training noise, this is a no brainer.</p>



<h3>5. Multiple GPUs</h3>



<p>Eventually, once you have pulled off all the other speedups, you will be left with one real option: scale up your compute! If you can really push the number of GPUs you can leverage, you can pull off crazy headlines like:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf">Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour</a> (cool in 2017)</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf">Highly Scalable Deep Learning Training System with Mixed-Precision: Training ImageNet in Four Minutes</a> (cool in 2018)</li></ul>



<p>Distributed computing has been and will continue to be a hot topic for years to come.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this helps shed light on some of the potential ways to speed up your neural network training. Let me know what type of training speedups you can achieve with this advice!</p>

<p>We made it into Iceland today! (No pictures of me in this post – I have horrible bed head at the moment, recovering from jet lag.)</p>



<p>As Americans, if we want to visit Iceland, we have a few choices:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Just drop in as a tourist for 90 days</strong> – except this is off-limits now due to the COVID19 travel bans</li><li><strong>Get a work permit and stay for years</strong> – this is what we’d originally planned to do when <a href="https://ozar.me/2020/10/were-planning-to-move-to-iceland-for-a-while/">I first shared that we were moving to Iceland for a while</a>. I had signed on to work part-time for an Icelandic company, a few days per month, in order to get a conventional work permit. However, my soon-to-be-employer had a shakeup, and rather than find another employer, we opted to…</li><li><strong>Get <a href="https://work.iceland.is/working/icelands-remote-work-long-term-visa">Iceland’s new teleworker visa</a></strong> – which lets you stay for 6 months per year as long as you’re from a country that wouldn’t normally need a tourist visa, and you can prove that you have a remote job that makes at least around $100K USD per year.</li></ul>



<p>The good news of using the teleworker visa:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Iceland">Iceland’s internet infrastructure</a> is fantastic, with full 1Gbit/sec fiber available all over the country, making it easy to work remotely</li><li>I don’t have to work for someone else, and I don’t have to go into an office, so I can limit my possible exposure to COVID19</li><li>It doesn’t affect our tax status – we don’t have to pay extra income taxes in Iceland, just our normal US income taxes back home</li></ul>



<p>The bad news:</p>



<ul><li>It’s only good for 6 months per year – they’ve talked about raising that, but for now it’s still just 6 months</li><li>It’s not eligible for a permanent residency permit – if I’d have had a regular work permit and stayed for 4 years straight (less vacations), we could have gotten a permanent residency permit, so we were planning to build a house in Iceland – that’s off for now</li></ul>



<h3>The teleworker visa application process</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members">teleworker visa application</a> is pretty simple, but can’t be done online: you have to send over real paper forms and passport photos. I would highly recommend shipping your application via a shipping company that includes signed proof of delivery and tracking. If you need help with the application process, <a href="https://www.workfromiceland.com/remotework">WorkFromIceland.com</a> offers an advisory package, but it costs thousands of dollars. (We didn’t use it, but I was tempted.)</p>



<p>After Iceland’s Directorate of Immigration receives your application, it goes into a bit of a black hole. We didn’t get email confirmation that our application was received, and <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/processing-time-and-applications-being-processed">Iceland’s immigration status page</a> doesn’t show what range of teleworker visas they’re working on. That page is only updated about once a month – if you apply, I’d recommend using a service like <a href="https://distill.io/">distill.io</a> to watch the page for changes.</p>



<p>We received approval via email after 5 weeks to process, but we had a few folks talking to the Iceland government on our behalf, so that might have sped things up. As we worked through the final logistics with the Directorate of Immigration, we found out that we were literally the very first people to get approvals for this new visa!</p>



<p>Iceland sends you a signed email confirmation, at which point you’re eligible to enter the country. You show this email to passport control as you enter Iceland, they check their databases, and in you go.</p>



<h3>Quarantining in Iceland</h3>



<p>Obviously this situation is very fluid, and I’m writing about the January 2021 situation. If you’re reading this later, check <a href="https://www.covid.is/english">covid.is</a> for the latest coronavirus travel restrictions.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="139" height="300" src="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png 139w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-277x600.png 277w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-600x1299.png 600w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-768x1663.png 768w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px"><figcaption>I passed!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>72 hours before you fly into Iceland, you have to <a href="https://visit.covid.is/">register for your free COVID19 test</a> and download the <a href="https://www.covid.is/app/en">Rakning C-19 app</a>. Iceland tracks you by your cell phone number, and the app helps the country do contact tracing.</p>



<p>When you arrive, you get a free COVID19 test at the airport. Because they’ve got testing gear centralized in one location, you get your results back in the app quickly – ours took just about 8 hours.</p>



<p>From the airport, you have to go into quarantine for 5 days. There are a set list of hotels that accept quarantining guests, or you can go to your house. You’re allowed to pick up a rental car, and if you have a long drive ahead of you, you can stay overnight in a quarantine hotel first before setting off on your journey – but only one night. Because there are storms in the north where we need to go, we decided to just do the whole quarantine at an approved hotel instead. Room service!</p>



<p>After 5 days, you get another free COVID19 test. (The date, time, and location are sent to you via email &amp; via the Rakning-C19 app within a day of you starting quarantine.) After you receive the all-clear from your second test’s results, then you’re done with quarantining. We’ll drive up north, settle into our rental house, set up my home studio. I’m teleworking again, teaching training classes starting February 1. Oh I think I’m supposed to say 1 Feb now. I’m European. (raises pinkie finger)</p>



<p>I’m not teleworking too hard though: during our stay here, we’re working 2 weeks a month, and spending the rest of the time seeing the amazing sights of Iceland.</p>



<p>If you’ve got any questions about the application process or arriving into Iceland, let me know.</p>

<p>I have a hobby. I like citing papers that provide strong evidence that is directly in opposition to what the authors claim. Lucky me, because PNAS just published a paper that fits snuggly into this category. It’s titled <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016976118#sec-13">“Experienced well-being rises with income, even above $75,000 per year”</a>. An even better title would have been “Income is a poor gauge for well-being; don’t bother”.</p>



<p>This is the central figure:</p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png" alt="" width="475" height="469" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x297.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-768x760.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-202x200.png 202w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"></a></figure>



<p>Whoa! The paper doesn’t fail to mention (multiple times) how this is virtually a perfect linear relationship between well-being and log(income). The authors conclude that people with higher income are more satisfied with life and experience more well-being!</p>



<h2>The real-life version of this graph</h2>



<p>Let’s see what this graph looks like with a linear x-axis and with simulated raw data (see code below). The black dots are simulated individual participants from the study, assuming that statistical assumptions are met. Their exact distribution along the x-axis is not known (the author did not publish raw data), but that doesn’t matter. It only matters how the dots are dispersed for a given income. </p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="462" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x462.png" alt="" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x462.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x135.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-768x346.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-444x200.png 444w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 1060w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>You are one of the black dots. You could be one of the other black dots. But income does virtually nothing to lower or improve people’s well-being or life satisfaction. Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively (see code below).</p>



<blockquote><p>Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively</p></blockquote>



<h2>Extreme income rise = extreme happiness?</h2>



<p>Let’s study the most extreme case: you have an annual income of just $15,000. But now you get to jump into the life of a rich person all the way to the other side of the (linear) graph with an annual income of $480,000. The result of this 32-fold increase in income is expected to be:</p>



<ul><li>Life Satisfaction: 62% used to rate higher than you. Now only 35% does! But there’s a 24% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li><li>Experienced Well-Being: 58% used to rate higher than you. Now only 40% does! But there’s a 33% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li></ul>



<p>Hmm, hardly the extreme happiness rush that one might expect would expect from reading the paper and the ensuing media coverage. It’s a vanishingly small effect, considering the extremeness of this example. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I think it’s fairer to say that we’ve now learned that this paper is solid evidence that income is a really poor gauge for happiness. Someone once wrote a song about this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://25.media.tumblr.com/bf7724c5134e8d05cef1d8431e8c1ad1/tumblr_mh1jcs8zyE1rhssuho1_500.gif" alt="money can't buy me love the beatles gif"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif">https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Code</h2>



<p>Computing quantiles and probability of deterioration is simple. The z-score is your score relative to the whole population in units of standard deviations. So just the results for Life Satisfaction were obtained by reading off the extremes of the graph and computing the associated quantiles in R: <code>pnorm(-0.3)</code> and <code>pnorm(0.4)</code>. Probability of negative income change is then just <code>pnorm(-0.3, 0.4)</code>.</p>



<p>The plots are fairly straightforward too. First, let’s simulate the raw data:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># Data
N = 33391  # Number of participants
incomes = exp(seq(log(15000), log(480000), length.out = N))  # x-axis of Figure 1
trend_wb = seq(-0.2, 0.25, length.out = N)  # Linear, read off Figure 1
trend_ls = seq(-0.3, 0.4, length.out = N)   # Linear, read off Figure 1
z_wb = rnorm(N, trend_wb)  # z-score is standard normal
z_ls = rnorm(N, trend_ls)  # z-score is standard normal

# Merge the data in long format
df = data.frame(
  incomes,
  z = c(rnorm(N, z_wb), rnorm(N, z_ls)),
  outcome = c(rep("Experienced Well-Being", N), rep("Life Satisfaction", N))
)
</pre>



<p>Now let’s plot it:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ggplot(df, aes(x = incomes, y = z)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.3) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = c(trend_wb, trend_ls), color = outcome), lwd = 2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 75000, lty = 2, lwd = 1, color = "#555555") + 
  facet_wrap(~outcome) + 
  #scale_x_continuous(trans = "log", breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000, labels = scales::label_number_auto()) + 
  labs(x = "Houshold income", y = "z-scored well-being") + 
  theme_bw(13) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
</pre>



<p>If you want to verify other results, you can fit the linear models to the (simulated) data and see that we can approximately replicate the r-values reported in the paper (r = 0.17 and r = 0.09) and that this correspond to 4% and 1.5% variance explained, respectively:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">summary(lm(z_ls ~ log(incomes)))
summary(lm(z_wb ~ log(incomes)))</pre>



<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to filter out <code>nonlow_incomes = incomes[incomes &gt; 30000]</code> and assess the predictive performance (<code>lm(z_ls ~ log(nonlow_incomes)</code>).</p>

<p>The first month of 2021 is a bad month to begin with, I always say to myself that we need to fail fast and fail quickly, but failing is not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>In November we started developing a health information management system (HIMS) for a laboratory service. Which will computerise their already paper based POS, reporting, patient registering system.</p>
<p>Me and my co founder was easterly working on the project for the last 2 months. We had thought we had everything we needed to nail this project.</p>
<ul><li>We had to knowledge about the domain, and we knew what are the problems faced by the people in the health industry</li><li>We had negotiated with a client, so we had a customer</li><li>And there was product market fit for a solution like this, with both health institutes and us benefiting by the service</li></ul>
<p>We quickly made a MVP, did some internal testing and it was working alright. Then we wanted to implement a parallel testing with the institute, with their current paper based system, and our cloud based system running in parallel to so we can get an idea on how we can improve our MVP.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to reach out to the client about implementing our service in parallel with their own paper based system, they were not interested on a computerised system anymore. </p>
<p>I don’t understand what changed their minds, maybe due to the pandemic their income might have reduced, which might have made them think twice about an investment. Maybe they are happy with their current paper based solution, and don’t see the value of a modern computer based system.</p>
<p>Even though no matter how much I believe that the benefit they gain from replacing a paper based system will not do anything, unless the clients can’t see the benefit and can’t be convinced. </p>
<p>Either way, me and my partner have two options,</p>
<ul><li>Look for a potential new candidate who is interested in using the system</li><li>Terminate the project and think about starting something new</li></ul>
<p>I will try to find potential customers who will be interested in a similar system until the end of the month, however if I was unable to find a suitable client, I might have to terminate the project and start something fresh. </p>
<p>Maybe failing fast and filing quickly has its benefits because, if we would have put more time and effort in creating the perfect solution, a rejection like this would have wasted lot of our time and effort.</p>
<p>What would you do if you are in my situation? Do you believe in fail fast and fail quickly? </p>

January 25, 2021 | https://amitness.com/2020/05/data-augmentation-for-nlp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/2020/05/data-augmentation-for-nlp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>Unlike Computer Vision where using image data augmentation is standard practice, augmentation of text data in NLP is pretty rare. Trivial operations for images such as rotating an image a few degrees or converting it into grayscale doesn’t change its semantics. This presence of semantically invariant transformation made augmentation an essential toolkit in Computer Vision research.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/semantic-invariance-nlp.png" alt="Challenge of Semantically Invariant Transformation in NLP"></p>
<p>I was curious if there were attempts at developing augmentation techniques for NLP and explored the existing literature. In this post, I will give an overview of the current approaches for text data augmentation based on my findings.</p>
<h2 id="nlp-data-augmentation-techniques">NLP Data Augmentation Techniques</h2>
<h2 id="1-lexical-substitution">1. Lexical Substitution</h2>
<p>This line of work tries to substitute words present in a text without changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="a-thesaurus-based-substitution">a. Thesaurus-based substitution</h3>
<p>In this technique, we take a random word from the sentence and replace it with its synonym using a Thesaurus. For example, we could use the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> database for English to look up the synonyms and then perform the replacement. It is a manually curated database with relations between words.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-wordnet.png" alt="Thesaurus-based substitution"></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626">Zhang et al.</a> used this technique in their 2015 paper “Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification”. <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12195/12023">Mueller et al.</a> used a similar strategy to generate additional 10K training examples for their sentence similarity model. This technique was also used by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> as one of the techniques in their pool of four random augmentations in the “Easy Data Augmentation” paper.</p>
<p>For implementation, NLTK provides a programmatic <a href="https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html">access</a> to WordNet. You can also use the <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#wordnet-integration">TextBlob API</a>. Additionally, there is a database called <a href="http://paraphrase.org/#/download">PPDB</a> containing millions of paraphrases that you can download and use programmatically.</p>
<h3 id="b-word-embeddings-substitution">b. Word-Embeddings Substitution</h3>
<p>In this approach, we take pre-trained word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, Sent2Vec, and use the nearest neighbor words in the embedding space as the replacement for some word in the sentence.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10351">Jiao et al.</a> used this technique with GloVe embeddings in their paper “<em>TinyBert</em>” to improve the generalization of their language model on downstream tasks. <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1306.pdf">Wang et al.</a> used it to augment tweets needed to learn a topic model.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-embedding.png" alt="Nearest Neighbors with Word Vectors"></p>
<p>For example, you can replace the word with the 3-most similar words and get three variations of the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-embedding-example.png" alt="Augmenting text with word embeddings"></p>
<p>It’s easy to use packages like Gensim to access pre-trained word vectors and get the nearest neighbors. For example, here we find the synonyms for the word ‘awesome’ using word vectors trained on tweets.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># pip install gensim
</span><span>import</span> <span>gensim.downloader</span> <span>as</span> <span>api</span>

<span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>'glove-twitter-25'</span><span>)</span>  
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>most_similar</span><span>(</span><span>'awesome'</span><span>,</span> <span>topn</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You will get back the 5 most similar words along with the cosine similarities.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[(</span><span>'amazing'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9687871932983398</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'best'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9600659608840942</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'fun'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9331520795822144</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'fantastic'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9313924312591553</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'perfect'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9243415594100952</span><span>)]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="c-masked-language-model">c. Masked Language Model</h3>
<p>Transformer models such as BERT, ROBERTA, and ALBERT have been trained on a large amount of text using a pretext task called “Masked Language Modeling” where the model has to predict masked words based on the context.</p>
<p>This can be used to augment some text. For example, we could use a pre-trained BERT model, mask some parts of the text, and ask the BERT model to predict the token for the mask.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-bert-mlm.png" alt="Masked Word Prediction"></p>
<p>Thus, we can generate variations of a text using the mask predictions. Compared to previous approaches, the generated text is more grammatically coherent as the model takes context into account when making predictions.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-bert-augmentations.png" alt="Text Augmentation using BERT"></p>
<p>This is easy to implement with open-source libraries such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/">transformers</a> by Hugging Face. You can set the token you want to replace with <code>&lt;mask&gt;</code> and generate predictions.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>pipeline</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, one caveat of this method is that deciding which part of the text to mask is not trivial. You will have to use heuristics to decide the mask, otherwise, the generated text might not retain the meaning of the original sentence.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01970">Garg. et al.</a> use this idea for generating adversarial examples for text classification.</p>

Figure: MLM augmentation via replacement or insertion (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01970">Source</a>)</p>
<h3 id="d-tf-idf-based-word-replacement">d. TF-IDF based word replacement</h3>
<p>This augmentation method was proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848">Xie et al.</a> in the Unsupervised Data Augmentation paper. The basic idea is that words that have <span>low TF-IDF scores</span> are uninformative and thus can be replaced without affecting the ground-truth labels of the sentence.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-tf-idf-word-replacement.png" alt="TF-IDF based word replacement"></p>
<p>The words that replace the original word are chosen by calculating TF-IDF scores of words over the whole document and taking the lowest ones. You can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/uda/blob/master/text/augmentation/word_level_augment.py">code implementation</a> for this in the original paper.</p>
<h2 id="2-back-translation">2. Back Translation</h2>
<p>In this approach, we leverage machine translation to paraphrase a text while retraining the meaning. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848">Xie et al.</a> used this method to augment the unlabeled text and learn a semi-supervised model on IMDB dataset with only 20 labeled examples. Their model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art model trained on 25,000 labeled examples.</p>
<p>The back-translation process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take some sentence (e.g. in English) and translate to another Language e.g. French</li>
<li>Translate the French sentence back into an English sentence</li>
<li>Check if the new sentence is different from our original sentence. If it is, then we use this new sentence as an augmented version of the original text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-back-translation.png" alt="Idea of Back-Translation"></p>
<p>You can also run back-translation using different languages at once to generate more variations. As shown below, we translate an English sentence to a target language and back again to English for three target languages: French, Mandarin, and Italian.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-backtranslation-multi.png" alt="Multi-step Back-Translation"></p>
<p>This technique was also used in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/52557">1st place solution</a> for the “Toxic Comment Classification Challenge” on Kaggle. The winner used it for both training-data augmentations as well as during test-time where the predicted probabilities for English sentence along with back-translation using three languages(French, German, Spanish) were averaged to get the final prediction.</p>
<p>For the implementation of back-translation, you can use TextBlob. Alternatively, you can also use <a href="https://amitness.com/2020/02/back-translation-in-google-sheets/">Google Sheets</a> to apply Google Translate for free. You can also use <a href="https://amitness.com/back-translation/">MarianMT</a> for back-translation.</p>
<h2 id="3-text-surface-transformation">3. Text Surface Transformation</h2>
<p>These are simple pattern matching transformations applied using regex and was introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04718">Claude Coulombe</a> in his paper.</p>
<p>In the paper, he gives an example of transforming verbal forms from contraction to expansion and vice versa. We can generate augmented texts by applying this.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-contraction.png" alt="Contraction and Expansion of Text"></p>
<p>Since the transformation should not change the meaning of the sentence, we can see that this can fail in case of expanding ambiguous verbal forms like:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-contraction-ambiguity.png" alt="Ambiguity in verbal form expansion"></p>
<p>To resolve this, the paper proposes that we allow ambiguous contractions but skip ambiguous expansion.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-contraction-solution.png" alt="Resolving ambiguity in verbal form expansion"></p>
<p>You can find a list of contractions for the English language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aList_of_English_contractions">here</a>. For expansion, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/kootenpv/contractions">contractions</a> library in Python.</p>
<h2 id="4-random-noise-injection">4. Random Noise Injection</h2>
<p>The idea of these methods is to inject noise in the text so that the model trained is robust to perturbations.</p>
<h3 id="a-spelling-error-injection">a. Spelling error injection</h3>
<p>In this method, we add spelling errors to some random word in the sentence. These spelling errors can be added programmatically or using a mapping of common spelling errors such as <a href="https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug/blob/master/model/spelling_en.txt">this list</a> for English.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-spelling-example.png" alt="Spelling Error Injection"></p>
<h3 id="b-qwerty-keyboard-error-injection">b. QWERTY Keyboard Error Injection</h3>
<p>This method tries to simulate common errors that happen when typing on a QWERTY layout keyboard due to keys that are very near to each other. The errors are injected based on keyboard distance.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-keyboard-error-example.png" alt="QUERTY Keyboard Error Injection"></p>
<h3 id="c-unigram-noising">c. Unigram Noising</h3>
<p>This method has been used by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02573">Xie et al.</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848">UDA</a> paper. The idea is to perform replacement with words sampled from the unigram frequency distribution. This frequency is basically how many times each word occurs in the training corpus.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-unigram-noise.png" alt="Unigram Noising"></p>
<h3 id="d-blank-noising">d. Blank Noising</h3>
<p>This method has been proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02573">Xie et al.</a> in their paper. The idea is to replace a random word with a placeholder token. The paper uses “_” as the placeholder token. In the paper, they use it as a way to avoid overfitting on specific contexts as well as a smoothing mechanism for the language model. The technique helped improve perplexity and BLEU scores.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-blank-noising.png" alt="Blank Noising"></p>
<h3 id="e-sentence-shuffling">e. Sentence Shuffling</h3>
<p>This is a naive technique where we shuffle sentences present in a training text to create an augmented version.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-sentence-shuffle.png" alt="Sentence Shuffling"></p>
<h3 id="f-random-insertion">f. Random Insertion</h3>
<p>This technique was proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> in their paper “Easy Data Augmentation”. In this technique, we first choose a random word from the sentence that is not a stop word. Then, we find its synonym and insert that into a random position in the sentence.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-random-insertion.png" alt="Random Insertion"></p>
<h3 id="g-random-swap">g. Random Swap</h3>
<p>This technique was also proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> in their paper “Easy Data Augmentation”. The idea is to randomly swap any two words in the sentence.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-random-swap.png" alt="Random Swap"></p>
<h3 id="h-random-deletion">h. Random Deletion</h3>
<p>This technique was also proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> in their paper “Easy Data Augmentation”. In this, we randomly remove each word in the sentence with some probability p.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-random-deletion.png" alt="Random Deletion"></p>
<h2 id="5-instance-crossover-augmentation">5. Instance Crossover Augmentation</h2>
<p>This technique was introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11241">Luque</a> in his paper on sentiment analysis for TASS 2019. It is inspired by the chromosome crossover operation that happens in genetics. <br>
In the method, a tweet is divided into two halves and two random tweets of the same polarity(i.e. positive/negative) have their halves swapped. The hypothesis is that even though the result will be ungrammatical and semantically unsound, the new text will still preserve the sentiment.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-instance-crossover.png" alt="Instance Crossover Augmentation"></p>
<p>This technique had no impact on the accuracy but helped with the F1 score in the paper showing …</p></section></div>

<h2>The software contract</h2>



<p>We software engineers love the metaphor of the <em>contract</em> when describing software behavior: <em>If I give you X, you promise to give me Y in return</em>. One example of a contract is the signature of a function in a statically typed language. Here’s a function signature in the Kotlin programming language:</p>


<pre title="">fun exportArtifact(exportable: Exportable): DeliveryArtifact
</pre>


<p>This signature promises that if you call the <em>exportArtifact</em> function with an argument of type <em>Exportable</em>, the return value will be an object of type <em>DeliveryArtifact</em>.</p>



<p>Function signatures are a special case for software contracts, in that they can be enforced mechanically: the compiler guarantees that the contract will hold for any program that compiles successfully. In general, though, the software contracts that we care about can’t be mechanically checked. For example, we might talk about a contract that a particular service provides, but we don’t have tools that can guarantee that our service conforms to the contract. That’s why we have to test it.</p>



<p>Contracts are a type of <em>specification</em>: they tell us that if certain <em>preconditions</em> are met, the system described by the contract guarantees that certain <em>postconditions</em> will be met in return. The idea of reasoning about the behavior of a program using preconditions and postconditions was popularized by C.A.R. Hoare in his legendary paper <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare69.pdf">An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming</a>, and is known today as Hoare logic. The language of <em>contract</em> in the software engineering sense was popularized by Bertrand Meyer (specifically, <em>design by contract</em>) in his language <em>Eiffel</em> and his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a>.</p>



<p>We software engineers like contracts they they help us reason about the behavior of a system. Instead of requiring us to understand the complete details of a system that we interact with, all we need to do is understand the contract. </p>

<p>Contracts, therefore, are a form of abstraction. In addition, contracts are <em>composable</em>, we can feed the outputs of system X into system Y if the postconditions of Y are consistent with the preconditions of X. Because we can compose contracts, we can use them to help us build systems out of parts that are described by contracts. Contracts are a tool that enable us humans to work together to build software systems that are too complex for any individual human to understand.</p>



<h2>When contracts aren’t useful</h2>



<p>Alas, contracts aren’t much use for reasoning about system behavior when either of the following two conditions happen:</p>



<ol><li>A system’s implementation doesn’t fully conform to its contract.</li><li>The precondition of a system’s contract is violated by a client.</li></ol>

<p>Whether a problem falls into the first or second condition is a judgment call. Either way, your system is now in a bad state.</p>

<p>A system that has gotten into a bad state is violating its contract, pretty much by definition. This means we must now deal with the implementation details of the system in order to get it back into a good state. Since no one person understands the entire system, we often need the help of multiple people to get the system back into a good state. </p>

<p>Since contracts can’t help us here, we deal with the complexity by leveraging the fact that different engineers have expertise in different parts of the system. By working together, we are pooling the expertise of the engineers. To pull this off, the engineers need to coordinate effectively. Enter the Basic Compact.</p>



<h2>The Basic Compact and requirements of coordination</h2>



<p>Gary Klein, Paul Feltovich and David Woods defined the <em>Basic Compact</em> in their paper <a href="http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf">Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>We propose that joint activity requires a “Basic Compact” that constitutes a level of commitment for all parties to support the process of coordination. The Basic Compact is an agreement (usually tacit) to participate in the joint activity and to carry out the required coordination responsibilities.</p></blockquote>



<p>One example of a joint activity is… when engineers assemble to resolve an incident! In doing so, they enter a Basic Compact: to work together to get the system back into a stable state. Working together on a task requires coordination, and the paper authors list three primary requirements to coordinate effectively on a joint activity: <em>interpredictablity, common ground, </em>and <em>directability.</em></p>



<blockquote><p><em>The Basic Compact is also a commitment to ensure a reasonable level of interpredictability. Moreover, the Basic Compact requires that if one party intends to drop out of the joint activity, he or she must inform the other parties.</em></p></blockquote>



<p><em><strong>Intepredictability</strong></em> is about being able to reason about the behavior of other people, and behaving in such a way that your behavior is reasonable to others. As with the world of software contracts, being able to reason about behavior is critical. Unlike software contracts, here we reasoning about agents rather than artifacts, and those agents are also reasoning about us.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Basic Compact includes an expectation that the parties will repair faulty knowledge, beliefs and assumptions when these are detected.</p></blockquote>

Keeping mutual beliefs up to date requires coordination work.</figcaption></figure>



<p>During an incident, the responders need to maintain a shared understanding about information such as the known state of the system and what mitigations people are about to attempt. The authors use the term <em><strong>common ground</strong></em> to describe this shared understanding. Anyone who has been in in an on call rotation will find the following description familiar:</p>



<blockquote><p>All parties have to be reasonably confident that they and the others will carry out their responsibilities in the Basic Compact. In addition to repairing common ground, these responsibilities include such elements as acknowledging the receipt of signals, transmitting some construal of the meaning of the signal back to the sender, and indicating preparation for consequent acts. </p></blockquote>



<p>Maintaining common ground during an incident takes active effort on behalf of the participants, especially when we’re physically distributed and the situation is <em>dynamic</em>: where the system is not only in a bad state, but it’s in a bad state that’s changing over time. Misunderstandings can creep in, which the authors describe as a <em>common ground breakdown</em> that requires repair to make progress. </p>



<p>A common ground breakdown can mean the difference between a resolution time of minutes and hours. I recall an incident I was involved with, where an engineer made a relevant comment in Slack early on during the incident, and I missed its significance in the moment. In retrospect, I don’t know if the engineer who sent the message realized that I hadn’t properly processed its implications at the time.</p>



<blockquote><p>Directability refers to deliberate attempts to modify the actions of the other partners as conditions and priorities change.</p></blockquote>



<p> Imagine a software system has gone unhealthy in one geographical region, and engineer <em>X</em> begins to execute a failover to remediate. Engineer <em>Y</em> notices customer impact in the new region, and types into Slack, “We’re now seeing a problem in the region we’re failing into! Abort the failover!” This is an example of <em><strong>directability</strong></em>, which describes the ability of one agent to affect the behavior of another agent through signaling.</p>



<h2>Making contracts and compacts first class</h2>



<p>Both contracts and compacts are tools to help deal with complexity. People use <em>contracts</em> to help reason about the behavior of software artifacts. People use the <em>Basic Compact</em> to help reason about each other’s behavior when working together to resolve an incident.</p>



<p>I’d like to see both contracts and compacts get better treatment as first-class concerns. For contracts, there still isn’t a mainstream language with first-class support for preconditions and postconditions, although some non-Eiffel languages do support them  (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2009/12/21/clojures-pre-and-post/">Clojure</a> and <a href="https://dlang.org/articles/cppcontracts.html">D</a>, for example). There’s also <a href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</a>, which bills itself as a <em>contract testing</em> tool, that sounds interesting but I haven’t had a chance to play with.</p>



<p>For coordination (compacts), I’d like to see explicit recognition of the difficulty of coordination and the significant role it plays during incidents. One of the positive outcomes of the growing popularity of <em>resilience engineering</em> and the <a href="https://www.learningfromincidents.io/">learning from incidents in Software</a> movement is the recognition that coordination is a critical activity that we should spend more time learning about.</p>



<h2>Further reading and watching</h2>



<p><a href="http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf">Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity</a> is worth reading in its entirety. I only scratched the surface of the paper in this post. <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw">John Allspaw</a> gave a great <a href="https://paperswelove.org/2016/video/john-allspaw-common-ground/">Papers We Love talk</a> on this paper.</p>



<p>Laura Maguire has done some recent PhD work on <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3380779">managing the hidden costs of coordination</a>. She also gave a <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/incident-command-system/">talk at QCon</a> on the subject.</p>



<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1363742">Ten challenges for making automation a “team player” in joint human-agent activity</a> is a paper that explores the implications of building software agents that are capable of coordinating effectively with humans. </p>

		<p>The Seattle City Council is fast-tracking an emergency <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4754242&amp;GUID=80536722-1338-426A-A175-DCF61CCAF08F">ordinance</a> that would require large grocery store companies to pay their Seattle-based retail workers an extra $4 per hour hazard pay through the end of the COVID-19 emergency.</p>
<p>Passing progressive, labor-friendly legislation is their strong suit. Doing the math and working out all the details… not so much.</p>


<p>Let’s cover the nuts and bolts of what this <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4754242&amp;GUID=80536722-1338-426A-A175-DCF61CCAF08F">legislation</a> does.</p>
<p>It applies to all grocery stores in Seattle that are owned by a company with at least 500 employees worldwide, and where the store is either greater than 10,000 square feet and mainly sells groceries (like a Safeway or QFC) or greater than 85,000 square feet and at least 30% of the square footage is dedicated to groceries. It does not cover convenience stores, food marts, drug stores, or farmers markets. All employees of such a store who are covered by the city’s minimum wage ordinance must be given an additional $4 per hour; that would include a bookkeeper working in the back office (with the not-unreasonable logic that they share a break room with the other store employees, and are equally exposed to COVID).</p>
<p>The ordinance contains most of the usual rules and regulations in the Council’s labor ordinances:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are record-keeping and notice requirements that the employer must follow;</li>
<li>The hazard pay must be listed as a separate line-item on an employee’s paystub, so it’s clear that they are getting it;</li>
<li>Employers may not game it by reducing employees’ regular pay;</li>
<li>The Office of Labor Standards will be tasked with enforcing it, with no budget increase for additional staff (OLS seems to be ok with this, because it overlaps at some level with the minimum wage and secure scheduling enforcement work);</li>
<li>Employers may not retaliate against employees who take action to ensure that they are getting paid the extra hazard pay;</li>
<li>The ordinance will stay on the books for three years after the hazard pay is no longer required, to allow for employees to file complaints for back pay they did not receive;</li>
<li>Employees have a private right of action to sue their employer if the hazard pay is not paid.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some special aspects of this ordinance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ordinance specifies that the Council intends to review it after it has been in effect for four months, to see what the impact has been;</li>
<li>Employers who have already been giving their employees hazard pay or “appreciation pay” get credit for that against the $4 per hour — though they need to carefully document it all.</li>
<li>This is emergency legislation, so it would go into effect as soon as the Mayor signs it — and according to the sponsor, Councilmember Mosqueda, the Mayor has signaled her support for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mosqueda is moving this bill through quickly. It had its one and only hearing last Friday, where the other four members of Mosqueda’s Finance and Housing Committee enthusiastically signed on as co-sponsors and quickly voted it out of committee. Normally any bill passed out of committee after noon on Thursday must wait an extra week before going on the agenda for final passage at a Monday afternoon Full Council meeting, but the committee and Council President Gonzalez suspended that rule so that it can be adopted Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=9085981&amp;GUID=CEC0C318-BE51-4A5E-A626-2470446BD22D">42-page bill</a> begins with ten full pages of recitals and findings related to all of the context of COVID-19, Seattle’s labor laws, and the fact that several other cities (mostly in California) are contemplating similar bills right now. That last point is one that Mosqueda has repeatedly hammered on, naming Long Beach, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland as some of the other jurisdictions working along the same path. And in case you’re wondering, it is no coincidence that suddenly several cities are working on this; the efforts tie back to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">report</a> published last November by the Brookings Institution’s <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/">Metropolitan Policy Program</a> called <em>“Windfall profits and deadly risks: How the biggest retail companies are compensating essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.”</em> The abstract for the report speaks for itself:</p>
<p><em>As the number of new COVID-19 infections smashes daily records, the pandemic has entered its deadliest phase yet. With a dark winter looming, millions of frontline essential retail workers face grave risks to their health, often for very low wages and without the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-covid-19-hazard-continues-but-the-hazard-pay-does-not-why-americas-frontline-workers-need-a-raise/">hazard pay</a> they were earning at the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the biggest retail companies in the country continue to earn eye-popping profits.</em></p>
<p><em>In this report, we examine this inequality from two perspectives. As frontline retail workers at top companies face unprecedented risks on the job, what compensation should they earn, and what have they earned so far during the pandemic? And as those large retail companies earn unprecedented profits, how have they balanced investing in their workers and their profits?</em></p>
<div>
<p><em>We find that while top retail companies’ profits have soared during the pandemic, pay for their frontline workers—in most cases—has not. In total, the top retail companies in our analysis earned on average an extra $16.7 billion in profit this year compared to last—a stunning 40% increase—while stock prices are up an average of 33%. And with few exceptions, frontline retail workers have seen little of this windfall. The 13 companies we studied raised pay for their frontline workers by an average of just $1.11 per hour since the pandemic began—a 10% increase on top of wages that are often too low to meet a family’s basic needs. On average, it has been 133 days since the retail workers in our analysis last received any hazard pay.</em></p>
<p><em>At most of the biggest retail companies in America, the gap between the struggles and sacrifices of low-wage frontline workers and the wealth they create for their employers and shareholders is wider than ever.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The conclusion from the report is that all retail companies should be paying their frontline workers at least $2 per hour in hazard pay during the COVID pandemic, and preferably considerably more. It provides no hard data to support a specific per-hour rate, just a few quotes from retail workers who feel that their employers are raking in billions while they take all the risks, and that $2 an hour isn’t nearly enough.&nbsp; Mosqueda’s bill, for that matter, provides no data or math to justify a $4 per hour hazard pay increase, though she has mentioned several times that the other jurisdictions are contemplating either $4 or $5. After several days of trying to get an answer from Mosqueda as to how she arrived at $4, she finally dropped into my Twitter DM’s Friday night with the following response:</p>
<p><em><span>I think the answer is a few things: </span></em></p>
<p><em><span>1) early on lots of folks did hazard pay differently anywhere between $2-5. $4 is somewhere in between. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span>2) if average grocery wage is somewhere between 16-20 and average shift is 4-6 hours. Getting an extra $4 per hour roughly leaves you with an extra hour to hour and a half of pay added to each work shift. Like other cities have concluded, this seems like right compensation for extra donning a doffing time, sanitizing etc. that grocery workers have had to do in pandemic.</span></em></p>
<p>This seems like a stretch — other than donning and doffing masks and gloves to go to and from work at the beginning and ends of shifts, changing masks and gloves during a shift is time that employees are already being paid for. And this demonstrates the difficulty in this conversation: the more compelling argument for hazard pay is the hazard itself and the accompanying risk that retail workers face, but it’s challenging to put a dollar figure on that.</p>
<p>The Brookings report, on the other hand, spends almost all of its time trying to make the argument that retail companies are&nbsp; rapacious corporate monsters taking advantage of their employees while raking in billions and profiteering from the pandemic.&nbsp; To do so it leans on mid-2020 corporate earnings statements and stock prices, as well as potential stock buybacks, to paint a negative picture of the companies. But there are several reasons why the report’s analysis doesn’t hold up well under scrutiny, especially when trying to decide on a hazard-pay rate for grocery workers in Seattle:</p>
<ul>
<li>The report relies on figures for the entire retail sector, not just grocery stores. And as we’ll review later, the grocery sector is one of the lowest-profit segments of the retail business.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, it uses mid-year figures. 2020 was quite the roller-coaster ride, and some of the mid-year highs turned out to be short-term anomalies.</li>
<li>Stock prices are a poor indicator of profitability, especially during an economic upheaval when investors look for safe harbors more than profits.</li>
<li>Likewise, in an economic upheaval, stock buybacks mean something different. When companies are looking for good liquid investments for their cash (and 2020 was a great time to have cash on hand), but other short-term cash investments like money-market accounts have rock-bottom interest rates (because everyone wants to be in cash), your own company looks like a great investment. The company can either retire the shares and thus increase the value of the remaining outstanding shares, or keep them around, use them for acquisition deals, or sell them off to raise raise cash later. Anyone who thinks that companies do stock buybacks only to artificially inflate their stock price doesn’t understand how public corporations work.</li>
<li>The report’s authors clearly haven’t done the full math on how much a $4/hour hazard pay increase will cost — and how that compares to the company’s profits.</li>
<li>The report uses national wage figures, when in fact Seattle already has a much higher minimum wage in place — higher than any of the other cities that Mosqueda cites as contemplating a new hazard pay requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s dive in.</p>
<hr>

<p>There are three major retail grocery chains operating in Seattle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kroger, which owns Fred Meyer and QFC;</li>
<li>Albertsons, which owns Safeway and Albertsons;</li>
<li>Costco.</li>

        <section>
            <p>Dropbox is always one of the first things I install when I setup a new computer - I have come to rely on it for storing important documents, photos and media that I can then access from anywhere. Recently my Dropbox subscription expired, and instead of renewing I decided to take a shot at replacing it with a homemade solution, and in this article I’m going to be walking you through how to do it yourself.</p>

<p>Here’s an outline of what we’re going to do:</p>

<h3 id="1-choosing-a-location-to-store-files-remotely">1. Choosing a location to store files remotely</h3>

<p>First, we have to decide where we want our files ultimately stored. When you use Dropbox, your files are of course stored within their storage infrastructure, which is what you’re paying for.</p>

<p>This was a simple decision for me, as I am already renting a few private servers with DigitalOcean that host my work. A private server, or VPS, is the perfect place for us to store our remote files, and while there are other storage solutions that could work, the power and flexibility of a full-fledged VPS will be crucial later on in this process.</p>

<p>If you don’t already have access to a VPS instance, setting one up takes just a few minutes and there are many providers to choose from. <a href="https://m.do.co/c/af8074d7d775">DigitalOcean</a> is my go-to choice, and you can rent a basic VPS starting at $5 per month.</p>

<p>You’ll need to get your VPS and SSH configured before moving on - <a href="https://sidia.li/2020/03/05/creating-configuring-ubuntu-vps/">follow this guide on how to do that</a>, and then return here to pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>If you already have SSH access to a VPS, or once you have SSH access setup and running smoothly on a new instance, we can move forward to picking out our storage location. I went with <code>/home/adam/docs</code> - go ahead and create your directory now. Be sure to replace the path <code>/home/adam/docs</code> in the following steps with the path you have picked for your directory.</p>

<p>Your storage location will then look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">&lt;IP&gt;:/home/adam/docs</code></pre></figure>

<p>where <code>&lt;IP&gt;</code> is the IP address of your VPS instance.</p>

<h3 id="2-setting-up-a-sync-mechanism-between-storage-locations">2. Setting up a sync mechanism between storage locations</h3>

<p>Just like when deciding where to store our files, there are several options for how we can proceed in actually syncing them between our local filesystem and the remore VPS filesystem.</p>

<p>One popular option for this task would be <code>rsync</code>.</p>

<p><code>rsync</code> is a Unix utility for copying files and directories between systems. It can also be used to setup synchronization between two directories in different locations - just what we’re looking for.</p>

<p>However, there’s another option we can go with that you’re probably already familiar with: Git.</p>

<p>Git is a powerful cross-platform protocol for synchronizing, and more specifically versioning, files across multiple peers. By using Git over <code>rsync</code>, we will be able to do things like recover or roll back our files and manage file versions across multiple devices.</p>

<p>Let’s initialize our remote storage directory as a git repository. Make sure that you’re logged into your VPS, and run the following commands (don’t forget to swap paths as needed):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>cd</span> /home/adam/docs
<span>$ </span> git init <span>--bare</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, we will be able to check files into our git repository from our local system via git over SSH! Pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Exit your VPS and choose a location on your local machine to “install” or checkout your new file service with the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>cd</span> /path/to/local/dir/
<span>$ </span> git clone &lt;USER&gt;@&lt;IP&gt;:/home/adam/docs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve finished setting up our repository and are ready to start syncing.</p>

<h3 id="3-configuring-remote-update-to-trigger-on-change-in-local-files">3. Configuring remote update to trigger on change in local files</h3>

<p>Listening for changes to a filesystem is an interesting challenge, and what we’ll need to do in order to trigger an update to remote whenever our files are changed.</p>

<p>While each operating system exposes a different event notification engine, such as inotify on Linux-based systems, there are again several options of cross-platform libraries that have been created to listen to and interact with those notification engines agnostically.</p>

<h4 id="entr">Entr</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/eradman/entr/">Entr</a> is one such library, and is available for all major operating systems. I started out with Entr as I found the syntax to be very approachable over the alternatives.</p>

<p>Entr worked great for all but one use case, and that was listening for additions of new files or directories. There is a specific mode you can run Entr in built for this purpose using the <code>-d</code> argument, but unfortunately I was unable to get that to work as expected- see this issue on Github.</p>

<h4 id="fswatch">FSWatch</h4>

<p>The next best option I found was <a href="https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch">FSWatch</a>, seemingly the more mature of the two projects with a slightly more complex CLI syntax, also cross-platform, so I gave that a shot.</p>

<p>You can install FSWatch with the following commands:</p>

<h6 id="on-macos">On macOS</h6>


<h6 id="on-ubuntu-1804">On Ubuntu 18.04</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The <code>fswatch</code> package is only available through the Ubuntu 18.04 official repositories. If you are running a less up-to-date version, you will need to update to 18.04 at a minimum before being able to install <code>fswatch</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have FSWatch installed, we are going to create a script to be executed when changes are detected in our repository. In your repository or anothr preferred location, create a file called <code>sync-repo.sh</code> and copy in the following script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>repo</span><span>=</span>/path/to/your/local/dir

<span>cd</span> <span>$repo</span>
git add <span>.</span>
git commit <span>-m</span><span>"auto-triggered sync"</span>
git pull origin master
git push origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, run this command to make the sync script executable:</p>



<p>Now, using our sync script, we can run this FSWatch command to begin listening for changes in our repo directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> fswatch <span>-o</span> /path/to/local/directory <span>--event</span> Created <span>--event</span> Updated <span>--event</span> Removed <span>--event</span> Renamed <span>--event</span> OwnerModified <span>--event</span> AttributeModified <span>--event</span> MovedFrom <span>--event</span> MovedTo <span>--exclude</span> <span>".git"</span> | xargs <span>-n1</span> <span>-I</span><span>{}</span> ./sync-repo.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What is this mouthful, you ask? Let’s break down how we’re configuring FSWatch to run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-o /path/to/local/directory</code> tells FSWatch what directory to listen to events in.</li>
  <li><code>--event &lt;EVENT-NAME&gt;</code> tells FSWatch to filter output to only this type of event. You can use multiple event flags with FSWatch to listen for multiple event types, as we are doing.</li>
  <li><code>--exclude ".git"</code> tells FSwatch to ignore the Git source directory and just to sync everything else.</li>
  <li>we finish off by piping updates from FSWatch into <code>xargs</code> which then processes and runs our <code>sync-repo</code> script.</li>
</ul>

<p>After running FSWatch with the above command, we’re ready to give it a try: go ahead and create or copy in a test file into your local repository directory, and you should immediately see output from FSWatch regarding a new git commit! Nicely done. Now, whenever FSWatch is running with the above command, any changes in your local directory will automatically be synced to the remote repository.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole point of this post is to sync your files between computers. If you have a second computer available, go ahead and checkout your git repository with the URL we used to check it out above, and then install and start FSWatch with the same command. Now that machine should also be in sync with any changes to your repository!</p>

<h3 id="4-configuring-local-updates-to-trigger-on-change-in-remote-files">4. Configuring local updates to trigger on change in remote files</h3>

<p>We are missing one last part, though, and it just happens to be the trickiest part. Our remote repository is now being updated whenever our files change, that’s great. But what about updates to our local files when the remote repository is updated? Right now, the only updates that our local repository is aware of is ones that have originated from that same computer. We need to setup a mechanism to push updates to all local copies of the repository whenever the remote repository changes.</p>

<h6 id="git-hooks">Git Hooks</h6>

<p>To do this, we’re going to utilize Git hooks, a built-in feature of Git that allows us to execute a script upon a specified event in the given repository. We’re going to take advantage of the <code>post-receive</code> hook, which will execute after any new updated has been fully received and checked into the git remote repository.</p>

<p>Log into your VPS, navigate to your git repository, and then into the <code>hooks</code> subdirectory, and create the <code>post-receive</code> script file with the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>cd</span> /home/adam/docs
<span>$ </span> <span>cd </span>hooks
<span>$ </span> <span>touch </span>post-receive
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this script, we will want to 1) SSH into any local clones of our repository, and then 2) pull the latest updates in from the remote repository.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You will need to assign each one a static IP address to be able to SSH into them from outside of your home network. If you don’t already have a static IP, you can get one a few different ways - <a href="">follow the steps in this article</a> to setup a static IP address for your computer, and then return back here to finish up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you’re ready, copy this script into your new <code>post-receive</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span># Home Computer</span>
ssh &lt;USER&gt;@&lt;HOME-IP-ADRESS&gt; <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>EOD</span><span>
	cd /path/to/local/repository
	git pull origin master
</span><span>EOD

</span><span># Any other computers where you checkout</span>
<span># the repository, copy and uncomment the</span>
<span># SSH code block below, to run the update</span>
<span># for that clone location.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># ssh &lt;USER&gt;@&lt;IP&gt; &lt;&lt;EOD</span>
<span># 	cd /path/to/repository/clone</span>
<span>#	git pull origin master</span>
<span># EOD</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be sure to replace <code>&lt;USER&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;HOME-IP-ADDRESS&gt;</code> with your home computer’s username and IP address, respectively, and then save the file.</p>

<p>We’ll also need to make sure it’s executable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>chmod</span> +x ./post-receive
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, each time anything is received to this git repository, our <code>post-receive</code> script will run, which will in turn SSH into each location of our checked out clones and pull in the latest changes.</p>

<p>Voila! We have recreated a basic Dropbox clone using SSH, FSWatch, …</p></section></article></div></div>

<h3>Anna Novakov and T. Novakov</h3>
<p><em>like a yellow silken scarf, the thick fog hangs along the quay[1]</em></p>
<p>In the 1880s, London’s frequent and well-documented episodes of fog were a phenomenon unique to England’s most densely populated, diverse, and industrialized urban center. The spectacular nature of the embankment fog, often described by eyewitnesses as changeable and even colorful, caught the imagination of many artists and writers who saw in these atmospheric manifestations a symbol of modernity and the role of industrialization on an evolving urban space. While the illusive city, shrouded in winter fog, created the perfect backdrop for mysterious, criminal activity, it also proved to be a compelling inspiration for those who read the fog as a more positive symbol of London’s cosmopolitan status. In this essay, we seek to interrelate some artistic and literary references to the fog with contemporary explanations addressing the causes of this atmospheric phenomenon. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we hope to shed light on the physical, artistic and even psychological implications of Victorian air pollution.[2]</p>
<p>Expansions of industrial activity during the later half of the 19th century resulted in frequent and severe air pollution episodes. In London, the smoke that billowed as a result of domestic and industrial coal burning began mixing with existing natural fog. Charles Dickens wrote in Bleak House that “smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes –- gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.”[3] The resulting smog (word coined from smoke + fog), was often sited by both visitors and locals as an optical experience unique to London. These low-laying fogs reduced visibility in the city to less than a mile while resulting in the loss of up to fifty percent of the sunshine in the winter months.[4] Thomas Hardy mentions it is in his 1900 poem “The Darkling Rush” as</p>
<p>I leant upon a coppice gate,<br>
When Frost was spectre-gray,<br>
And Winter’s dregs made desolate<br>
The weakening eye of day.<br>
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky<br>
Like strings of broken lyres,<br>
And all mankind that haunted nigh<br>
Had sought their household fires.[5]</p>
<p>While writer Arthur Symons wrote that “In London, men work as if in darkness, scarcely seeing their own hands . . . and not knowing the meaning of their labour.”[6] French writer Joris-Karl Huyseman likewise wrote in 1884 that “A rainy, colossal London smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly streaming and smoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes . . . All this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks which were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames . . . while trains rushed past at full speed or rumbled underground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and while, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous advertisements flared through the eternal twilight.”[7]</p>
<p>In Jayati Gupta’s essay “London Through Alien Eyes,” published in Literary London: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Representation of London, he references Madame Krishnabhabini Das’ 1880s London experiences. She noted that “this sort of fog persists through the day and assumes different hues – sometimes ashen – sometimes black – sometimes yellow.” Another eye witness L.C.W. Bonacina gave this insightful description of yellow fog’s evolution “A really bad nineteenth century fog appeared early in the morning as a thick white mist, like the country fog, only dirtier. With the lighting of the fires it would soon become yellow and pungent, irritating the throat and eyes, till midday the continued outpouring of chimney products would have turned the fog a sooty brownish black causing the darkness of night.” Furthermore he added that, “During summer months major fogs were virtually unknown in the nineteenth century just as they are in the twentieth.”[8]</p>
<p>These, and other more contemporary reports most often described the yellow hue prevalent in London fog. Oscar Wilde noted the yellow hue in his poem “Impression du Matin”:</p>
<p>The Thames nocturne of blue and gold<br>
Changed to a Harmony in grey:<br>
A barge with ochre-coloured hay<br>
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold<br>
The yellow fog came creeping down<br>
The bridges, till the houses’ walls<br>
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul’s<br>
Loomed like a bubble o’er the town.[9]</p>
<p>Bonacina’s chromatic observations can certainly be credited to the predominance of domestic coal burning. Tars from low temperature coal combustion in the morning were yellow. The yellow tar, created in the morning, was soluble in fog water and thus colored the fog droplets creating the appearance of chromatic fog. Later in the day, emissions from industry, steam locomotives and ships increased coinciding with the darkening fogs. Tar produced in these higher temperatures took on a dark brown coloration. Atmospheric chemist Peter Brimblecombe proposed the following three possible origins for the yellow fog: (i) light scattering by smoke particles above the fog such that it was illuminated by yellowish light, (ii) the gas and weak electric light gave the fog a yellowish hue at night, and (iii) tarry compounds actually colored the fog, giving preference to the latter possibility.[10]</p>
<p>Victorian writers, noted with some frequency additional chromatic effects produced by the modern fog. In 1899, an article was published in The Artist magazine that read “There’s nothing to be seen like it ever – in any town in Europe. They say it’s due to the smoke and it may be; but just look at it. Look at the purple and crimson, the scarlet and gold . . . until with just the tiniest fleck of pink it sinks into the palest green.”[11] Aaron Watson, in an article in the Magazine of Art, suggests that the city “enfolds all ugliness in a purple haze.”[12] Charles Dickens in his novel Our Mutual Friend notes that “Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was great, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City — which call Saint Mary Axe – it was rustic black.”[13]</p>
<p>Visual artists, such as French painter Claude Monet, witnessed the yellow fogs as well as a variety of additional chromatic atmospheric effects. For Monet, London’s varied fogs were a spectacular manifestation of turn-of-century city life -– an optical phenomenon that he captured in a well documented and frequently referenced series of canvases.</p>
<p>London was a magical place for Monet. He beamed “I so love London! But I love it only in winter. It’s nice in summer with its parks, but nothing like it is in winter with the fog, for without the fog, London wouldn’t be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Those massive, regular blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak.”[14] In 1900 he added that “The weather is magnificent but unsettled . . . I can’t begin to describe a day as wonderful as this. One [colored] marvel, after another each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.”[15]</p>
<p>The constantly changing chromatic effects of London’s fog were unusual and bear little resemblance to contemporary atmospheric phenomena. To understand this unique development it is vital to discuss the evidence for these chromatic fogs. Taking into account the lack of scientific, measurement-based observations, we would like to employ artistic production, such as Monet’s Thames series, as indirect evidence –- source material that forms the basis for a broader explanatory discussion of this form of air pollution.</p>
<p>Between 1898 and 1901, Monet made numerous extended trips to London. Working from an upscale Savoy Hotel suite, he created numerous paintings of the Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges. As an accomplished and sensitive colorist, Monet found himself captivated by London’s fog and its spectacular optical appearance, which he referred to as l’enveloppe. Of particular relevance to this essay is Monet’s description “The fog in London assumes all sorts of colors; there are black, brown, yellow, green, [and] purple fogs.”[16] Was the colored fog depicted in these paintings and referenced in written accounts a subjective interpretation of the London’s cityscape or documentary evidence of London’s timely and transient atmospheric effects?</p>
<p>These hazy, colorful paintings are certainly marvelous Impressionist interpretations of the city’s skyline. The chromatic effects that Monet was trying to capture in the bridge scenes were fleeting and momentary. The changeable weather conditions of the morning fog and winter color palette, forced the artist to work on stacks of canvases at the same time. Monet recalled that “At the Savoy Hotel . . . from which I looked at my points of view, I had up to a hundred canvases under way –- of the same subject. By searching among the sketches feverishly, I chose one of them that didn’t differ too much from what I saw; despite everything, I altered it completely. When work was finished, I would notice, in moving my canvases, that I had overlooked precisely the one that would have suited me best and which I had at hand.”[17] Monet’s artistic output and his frantic attempts to capture fleeting effects are visual evidence of the changing and colorful atmospheric effects he witnessed.</p>
<p>For Monet, the Waterloo Bridge took on many manifestations depending on the time of day and visual effects of the fog. The bridge appears as mauve semi-circles in the Chicago Art Institute’s version of the Waterloo Bridge. The painting foreground focuses our eye on surface effects of undulating droplets of colored water. Receding into the background, factory chimneys reinforce the arches of the bridge while further bisecting Monet’s composition. …</p></div></article></div></div></section></div></div></div>

(Rafael Henrique / Getty Images)"></a><figcaption>(Rafael Henrique / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Today’s newsletter is a special edition. A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

Either purpose-built <a href="https://www.printdry.com/">filament dryers</a> or generic vertical food dehydrators to dry a filament before use or after misplacing it inside your pool, but they don’t take care of the permanent/long term storage.</p><p>There are also filament containers, which take care of storage as well. This is the most used type as you just set the target humidity and forget it.

So it’s set, I’ll build something on my own.</p><h2 id="what-do-we-have-around">What do we have around</h2><p>The printer was laying on a perfectly sized nightstand and it was a very good fit. The filaments were placed on the first drawer and random prints awaiting use as well as some spare parts were sitting on the second drawer. I just needed to somehow create a controlled climate on the first drawer.</p><p>My target was to use as much “building blocks” as possible (aka have around), so heat &amp; silica gel.</p><p>Silica gel requires no further explanation - as packages from all over the world arrive at your house, you’ll gonna build a big stock of them and never run out.</p><p>For the heat part though, I took an interesting turn: Use the small heatbed I had when I tried to make a <a href="https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v01/">delta printer</a> and then spent thousands in therapy for PTSD.</p><p>The electronics to control the heatbed was the easiest part - I instantly knew I’d use one of the thousands ESP8266 WeMos Minis I had lying around (I had no need for WiFi or the horsepower, but it’s a buck each and I had thousands), with a DHT22 temperature &amp; humidity sensor and probably a screen to have a view on what’s going on</p><p>So the plan was the following:</p><ul><li>Make the temperature/humidity controller using the ESP</li><li>Install the heatbed and wire it to the ESP</li><li>Throw in silica gel bags</li></ul><h2 id="building-the-climate-controller">Building the climate controller</h2><p>For this recipe you’re going to need:</p><ul><li>WeMos Mini</li><li>DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor (the white one, the blue is garbage)</li><li>PCD8544 screen (Nokia 3310 screen)</li><li>Some wire</li><li>(optionally) WeMos Dual Base</li></ul><p>Lego time! 🙂</p><p>3 minutes later I had both my debugging and (almost) finalized hardware.

Just buy a bunch of WeMos shields from aliexpress for a couple of euros each and never go back. It’s fun!</p><p>I should point out that for no apparent reason, my obsession kicked in and I “had” to make a shield for the 5V voltage regulator (I wanted to feed from the same 12V line that I was gonna feed the bed) and a “backpack” shield on the relay that breaks out 2 pins to connect the bed thermistor to. I don’t know why I didn’t use a breadboard. My overengineering could not be tamed.</p><h2 id="programming-the-climate-controller">Programming the climate controller</h2><p>Another cheat mode I used in this project apart from WeMos is <a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPHome</a>. I love this lil fella!</p><p>ESPHome is a firmware for the ESP family that transforms it to an IoT device. It’s the programming equivalent of Lego (TM) for sensor-based projects in YAML. Definitely check it out - it’s easier than you think and it does not need (but is able to talk to) any other home automation services, devices or bridges.</p><p>I say that it’s a cheat as there’s no need for WiFi capability per-se (although it’s nice to watch the humidity on your phone) but I didn’t NOT want it and ESPHome made the whole project much easier and give the ability to program/update it over the air for free (as in beer, freedom, time, the boobs and the rest).

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

(For example after file is processed, or when message received from a live chat!).

See: <a href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-graphql-playground-f1e0a018f05d">GraphQL Playground</a>.</li><li>Ease of handling deprecations, without introducing versioning and fragmenting the backend. See: <a href="https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/deprecated/">Deprecation Dgraph</a>.</li><li>It's scalable, as endpoints don't have fixed payload, so the same endpoint can be used everywhere.</li><li>Response key aliasing is easy.

			There are plenty of email tracking services out there but they all rely on changing your email configuration by having them act as intermediaries.
			<br>This obviously raises strong privacy and security concerns. With this service there is no messing with DNS records and the content of your emails never leaves your own computer.
			</p>
			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>
				Open terminal and type the following (followed by Enter):<br>
				<span>
					curl -s https://bigballi.com/files/track-emails.sh | bash
				</span>
				This will save the workflow in your services folder.
			</p>
			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<p>
				Open Mail and create a new message as you would normally.
				<br>When you're done, select <b>Mail → Services → TrackEmail</b>
				<br>This will replace all the links in your message with tracked ones.
				<br>Send the email and you will recevie notifications when the message is opened and/or links are clicked.
			</p>
			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>Permissions</h3>
			<p>
				The first time you run the script the system might request additional permissions.
				<br>To grant these permissions:
				<br>• open System Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy → Privacy
				<br>• select Accessibility in the left column
				<br>• make sure the lock in the bottom left corner is open (if not click on it and provide your password)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations. Remove the 90% of stuff that’s only moderately relevant, and be ruthlessly focused on the 10% that’s most relevant to your audience. Talking about your camping trip? <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" target="_blank">Start right before you almost get eaten by a bear</a>. Not a detailed agenda of the days leading up to arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>Consider overhauling and starting from scratch</strong>: If you’re struggling to describe your value, figure out <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-fix-limbo-copywriting" target="_blank">if the problem is the marketing or the underlying idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Focus on what your customer wants to hear about, not what you want to talk about</strong>: This is an easy way to figure out what to trim from your talking points. You think, “I have so much to talk about. Where do I start??” Start by asking yourself what would change your audience’s behavior for the better. I call this principle <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/strategy-not-self-expression" target="_blank">Strategy, Not Self-Expression</a>.</p><p><strong>Choose the right heuristics and design to appeal to people like us</strong>: Upon landing on a site, most customers are judging you within a few seconds. “People like us” refers to whatever group you might identify with. For example, people like us could be thoughtful, design-conscious knowledge workers at tech startups.</p><p>What’s a product that instantly sold you? I’m curious and would love to know…</p></div></div></div>]]>

          Tools I Love to Not Think About
          
        </h3>

</div>
<p>I use a lot of software tools for my job - and personally, for that matter.
Some live in the forefront of my brain, like emacs.
Others live in the background, like my terminal (alacritty).
Some of these background tools do their jobs <em>so well</em> and <em>so reliably</em> that I can sometimes forget that they’re humming away for me every day, without any hassle to fix or maintain them.</p>

<p>This is an informal list of those tools that I love to never have to think about.</p>

<h4 id="syncthing">Syncthing</h4>

<p>Remember when Dropbox felt like a novelty?
When you finally didn’t have to lug around thumb drives as often?
Syncthing keeps the best parts of that experience (a synchronized folder wherever you are) without all the… other stuff Dropbox seems to have added over the years.</p>

<p>In addition to being open source, another distinction of Syncthing is that you’re not constrained by a third party in regards to storage size.
Drop Syncthing on your server and the only limit is how much storage you have.
Moreover, linking instances of Syncthing together is a surprisingly hassle-free experience - no worrying about sharing IP addresses or other details, once you add a device by ID, the rest sort of just works.
The Syncthing developers have added many nice quality-of-life improvements over the years (QR codes, the “introducer” paradigm, and more) without jumping the feature shark.</p>

<p>Syncing git repos has its place, but when you need something super user friendly that is all about actively synchronizing folders across machines, Syncthing reigns supreme.
After setting it up on my servers, the Syncthing daemon has essentially been completely hands-off, maintenance-wise, and bringing my synced folder to a new host is equally easy and doesn’t require any thought after initial setup.</p>

<h4 id="openzfs-on-linux">OpenZFS on Linux</h4>

<p>I set up my four-disk ZFS array years ago using FreeNAS on an old HP Proliant Microserver N40L.
Since then, that same RAIDZ pool has been through many upgrades, a few OS moves (to Nas4Free then Arch Linux), and more than one failed disk (some in dramatic fashion).
Through it all, my data has been reliably safe and easy to maintain.</p>

<p>I’ve heard the same thing from multiple people: the zfs command line tooling feels like some of most ergonomic command-line interface you’ve ever used.
Performing a scrub, swapping out a disk, replicating snapshots - all of these tasks are so simple that it’s hard <em>not</em> to script many of them to make maintenance happen without any manual intervention.
The entire system feels like it was written with operators in mind - aspects like zed (the event system) make sending notifications about pool events stupidly easy (I send a notification to myself when an automated weekly scrub finishes, and the notification is a few lines of bash).</p>

<p>The offsite backup story is sort of like unix zen - the fact that you can move a snapshot across the internet securely with a <code>zfs send | ssh zfs receive</code> and interject arbitrary commands into the pipeline to fit your needs (like gzip or pv) is beautiful.
I once ran into a situation in which buffering over the network would help smooth remote replication, and added the equivalent of an <code>| mbuffer</code> to my command.
Buffered snapshot network transfer, and all with a standard unix pipe.</p>

<p>Of course, the core of what OpenZFS does is solid.
Scrubbing has been a reliable tool, and overall, I just… don’t have to think about it.
It checks my array integrity regularly, reports problems, and I get the latest features via dkms.</p>

<p>There are still OpenZFS detractors out there - CDDL licensing, RAM requirements (huh?) and others.
The only thing I’ll say is that the tremendous quality of ZFS has outshined any concerns I might’ve had with it initially, and the work is still moving steadily ahead (native encryption is a recent addition).</p>

<h4 id="ssh">SSH</h4>

<p>At first blush, <code>ssh</code> sort of seems like a tool an operations engineer would actively think very much about, right?
That would probably be the case for any other featureful remote access tool, but <code>ssh</code> is so elegantly designed that it feels like a muscle now: it responds affirmatively whenever I need it, without surprise, and gains strength with new features as time goes on.
More than that, becoming more familiar with it over time has yielded numerous ways to leverage it for a variety of uses.</p>

<p>Yes: <code>ssh</code> gets the remote access job done.
I no longer have any Windows machines in my home (huzzah!) so if I have a host on my home network, <code>ssh</code> can reach it.
With some light config management on my ~20 personal machines (via ansible) to get the right <code>authorized_keys</code> defined, and my user id <code>tylerjl</code> consistent everywhere, getting where I need to go takes as much effort as a reflex.</p>

<p>In the past few years, as I’ve taken more control of my personal data and self-hosted my personal information storage, <code>ssh</code> has made secure offsite backups easy.
With the aforementioned ZFS setup, I tunnel between storage hosts that live behind ISP NATs with ssh.
In the old days, this was with <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/774500/how-to-setup-transparent-ssh-when-there-are-multiple-servers"><code>ProxyCommand</code></a>.
However, one great thing about ssh is that it’s still under active development.
Whereas hosts behind a NAT or bastion used to require some arcane configuration lines, now something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p bastion
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Is even easier:</p>



<p>This is also exposed as the <code>-J</code> flag.</p>

<p>I lean on <code>ssh</code> in many different ways, and it is consistently the layer I never have to worry about failing.
Whether I’m editing remotely via tramp, transferring files over scp, or scripting between hosts for backups or automation, <code>ssh</code> works as expected and only improves over time without unexpected surprises.</p>

<h4 id="coda">Coda</h4>

<p>Is there a tool you use that’s exceptional in its utility and quality?

                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/FictionalFlag.jpg">Did you ever want to live in your own country, to make your own rules? Tired of adjusting yourself to other people?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>
                    <p>I have saved the data files here for future reference: <a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz">ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeamountsUnder100m.kmz">SeamountsUnder100m.kmz</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>

<p>The War on Drugs is a massive failure. As neuroscientist and Columbia University Professor Dr. Carl Hart writes in his latest book, <em>Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</em>, “the American taxpayer spends approximately $35 billion each year fighting this war, yet the drugs in question remain as plentiful, if not more so, than they were in 1981, when the sum total of America’s annual drug-control budget was a mere $1.5 billion.” The difference now, Hart describes, is that today, tens of thousands of people are dying from drug-related overdoses—with opioids being the “primary culprit.” But it’s not that simple, when the “opioid crisis” in particular is, in reality, “a crisis of data collection and reporting.” In this account, Hart digs below the surface to re-evaluate the American relationship to drugs, while shedding light on his own personal relationship to drugs, as well. Both captivating and controversial, we caught up with Dr. Hart to talk about drugs and parenting, policy, addiction, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-db-everyone-s-excited-about-your-new-book-what-s-one-thing-you-really-want-readers-to-glean-from-it"><span id="DB_Everyones_excited_about_your_new_book_Whats_one_thing_you_really_want_readers_to_glean_from_it">DB: Everyone’s excited about your new book. What’s one thing you really want readers to glean from it?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>CH: The thesis of the book is very simple: It’s about liberty so long as you don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their liberty. I want people to understand that liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected in our founding document. It’s the core of being American.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-in-the-book-you-re-very-open-about-your-own-drug-use-what-s-that-like-coming-out-of-the-drug-closet-as-a-professional-and-as-a-parent"><span id="In_the_book_youre_very_open_about_your_own_drug_use_Whats_that_like_coming_out_of_the_drug_closet_as_a_professional_and_as_a_parent"><strong>In the book, you’re very open about your own drug use. What’s that like, coming out of the drug closet, as a professional and as a parent?</strong></span></h2>
<p>That’s a big question I have to face and I still struggle with it. The most important point for me is that I live like the man that I claim to be, and that means that I have to think about how my children see me. They know that I take care of my responsibilities with them and that I care about our broader community. They see people suffering, being vilified, and persecuted for being labeled a drug user—and they know their father is standing up on behalf of those people, who have been cast away in society, and they feel good about it. As long as they feel good, I feel good. My primary concern is my family, and my children in particular.&nbsp;</p>

I think before he thought I would remember, my dad would sometimes smoke “herb” in front of me before I was old enough to register the observation. How do you handle this with your own kids?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>

<p>My drug use is still personal and private. It’s like asking, “have your children seen you have sex?” I’m 54 years old, I’m not a child, and so I engage in grown-up behaviors in which my children will not observe me. I don’t observe them doing certain things, either. I only care about them being safe and taking care of themselves.</p>

At the same time, it’s a good opportunity to model a responsible, healthy relationship to drugs (be it heroin, cannabis, or even alcohol). How do you reconcile this with the query from those who might bring up the argument that trying drugs, like heroin, will automatically lead to addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>There’s a lot in that question, so let’s unpack the first major point: How do you model responsible drug behavior? First of all, I don’t think of drug-taking behavior as abhorrent or unique. It’s just behavior. How do you model behavior? Well, what do responsible people do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They keep their appointments, they make their obligations. And with drugs, you set aside time for that activity, and you know how long it takes for you to engage in that activity, and once it’s over, you carry out the other responsibilities you have. It’s not different from any other behavior—this is the big lie that’s so hard to undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this notion that one hit and you’ll become addicted is nonsense: That point is always overstated. If a person is already irresponsible, then if they take heroin, they might also be irresponsible with their heroin use. How responsible a person is will tell how well they handle those other behaviors; it predicts how well they will do heroin or pay their bills. So their drug behavior, whether heroin or cannabis, is not unique from other behaviors.</p>

<p>In the U.S. and around the world, when we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug with people who meet criteria for addiction. You’ll find that people who already have psychiatric disorders, or limited economic opportunities, are more likely to have the criteria for drug addiction. It’s not the drug that you have to focus on, but those other factors, regardless of whether they’re using the drug or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the drug discussion is that addition has hijacked the conversation, such that we only talk about drug addiction when talking about drug use. It’s like only talking about car crashes when we talk about automobiles. It’s ridiculous. So we have to change that, and that’s what I’m trying to do. If when we talk about drug use and we gave addiction proportional treatment of the topic, it wouldn’t be talked about that often. It’s a concern, but the reason people are addicted is not because of the drug.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>When we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug.</p></blockquote>

<p>When we think about the addiction narrative, the reason many of these substances are prohibited is American racism. One of the primary motivating factors behind alcohol prohibition was dislike of the Germans; remember this was around the time of World War I. When we think about cocaine, to vilify it, its negative effects were associated with Black people. When we wanted to vilify opioids, we paired it with the Chinese. All of this media hysteria was inaccurate—lies and misinformation. By connecting horrible acts with those groups and the drugs they used, the media reports and politicians gained standing. They oftentimes used white women as the object of their protections, so they were protecting white women and children from being corrupted with these drugs. Once they were corrupted, they would intermingle with those other racial groups—so they really tied the potential for addiction with these drugs, hoping to make people fearful of taking them in their quest to protect primarily white women. That’s how we have this connection.</p>

And how do we define drug abuse, versus drug use, to begin with?</span></h2>
<p>We define it as when people have certain symptoms in which they have disruptions in their functioning: They may not be meeting their occupational obligations, their family obligations, or other obligations. They may be actively trying to quit and having a hard time. They may experience some negative effects from their drug use, whether physiological or social, and they are disturbed by all these symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They, themselves, must be disturbed by these symptoms. Such as, you may engage in behavior and your significant other may not like it, but you may not be troubled by the behavior or it may not actually be a problem. So the person, themself, must be distressed by these symptoms, too. The person’s own perspective is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our country, each of us are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We often think about those rights as guarantees in jingoistic terms, as opposed to unpacking how serious and noble those ideas are, and so I’m trying to remind people that everyone has those unalienable rights. That means they can’t be taken away from them, as long as they don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a relative who had a drug problem, I’d be hard pressed to find a place in the U.S. where I would send them—in large part because, too often, those places focus their energies on the drug itself, as opposed to those other psychosocial factors, such as whether that person has housing, health care, or gainful employment (that is, employment that would be appropriate for their age, education, ability to support a family, all those things). Does the person have other psychiatric illnesses or problems going on? All those factors are far more important than the drug itself. And too often the drug rehab centers focus on the drug itself and miss the boat.</p>

<p>For one, why are we missing the boat when we talk about opioids? We are getting it wrong because there is money in getting it wrong. There are grants now to deal with the so-called opioid crisis. This is an economic strategy, as opposed to making sure people have gainful employment. Police organizations get grants. NGOs get grants to deal with opioids. Coroners, medical examiners, everyone is getting money to deal with it. Everything they do, they see opioids because that’s where the spotlight is shining—if you’re looking for something, you’ll find it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>We are proud to announce the launch of Library Futures Institute, a 501c3 organization fighting for the technology-positive future of libraries.</p>
              <p>The Board chose the name “Library Futures” understanding that our organization will work to ensure a sustainable future for libraries in the modern digital environment where our users live, work, and learn.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Our libraries and their promise of uplift and transformation are facing a threat to their continued existence. As our society moves into an increasingly digital landscape, libraries have built significant collections that have become inaccessible, unaffordable, or worse, subject to limitations striking at the very ability for a library to loan books to patrons. The significant legal and financial value of a collection, and the library's role in providing continual access to the collection, has been diminished by restrictive licensing, unscrupulous pricing, or an outright refusal to sell works to libraries. These policies directly impact the library's right to lend, copy, and preserve materials for the future.</p>
              <p>Without access to digital resources and digital books, libraries will not be able to continue to meet the needs of patrons. Libraries already struggle to provide access to digital resources. Market shifts have resulted in a handful of publishing entities who use highly restrictive licenses designed to lock down information rather than facilitate access to it. The true impact of these policies has become terribly clear during the pandemic as users have been cut off from access to collections.</p>
              <p>Library Futures will safeguard our libraries' right to provide free and open access to information to all citizens, a critical aspect of democratic process. Crucially, guiding the public in an increasingly complicated information landscape is a primary mechanism through which libraries can support the public good. Scholars like Joan Donovan assert that “hiring 10,000 librarians'' will fix our media landscape – those librarians will need access to high-quality, reasonably priced, and well-preserved materials. The future of our culture and knowledge depends on this.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We are dedicated to ensuring that libraries will continue to provide open, non-discriminatory access to information to benefit the general learning, research, and intellectual enrichment of the public.</p>
              <p>The work of the Library Futures Institute will also advance a research and programmatic agenda that strengthens the rights of libraries,&nbsp; including working toward ownership of digital works through the adoption of less restrictive licensing agreements for e-media and e-books. New licenses should allow libraries to own digital works with the same associated rights as print materials. This change would empower, not challenge, the library’s mission to promote access to knowledge, culture, and literature.</p>
              <p>The people who are involved with the Library Futures Institute – our Board, our Executive Director, our volunteers, our donors, and our future partners (like you!) - are keenly aware of the inequity in access to information. Immigrant communities, low-income families, and people living without internet access have the most at stake in this fight. Our communities do not have the resources to pay top-dollar for access to digital books at a premium, and will be unable to access the information and resources they need for school, work, and general learning.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>That awareness infuses every aspect of our work, from our future Catalyst Fund, to library-focused programming, and our support for digital lending.</p>
              <p>We are excited to launch today and partner with libraries, academic institutions, foundations, consortia, non-profits, and others, to enhance Library Futures’ mission.</p>
              <p>And Library Futures will work for all libraries - public, private, school, media, digital – to uphold our mission and values.</p>
              <p>We believe in the promise of libraries. We believe that access to information can uplift and edify society. We are also committed to preserving works for future generations. And we believe technology, used appropriately, can play an important part in saving a library mission and values.</p>
              <p>Together, we can change the paradigm. Together, we are Library Futures.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-2fc7e2d4=""><p>We love <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Individually, as an organization - we're just fans through and through.</p>
<p>As such we like to write with the Hacker News audience in mind.</p>
<p>In that regard we've met with a small - tiny, really (but very encouraging) - amount of success: The story of our form app has piqued the curiousity of some fellow bootstrappers as they follow us building and running a small SaaS business.</p>
<p>Here are our analytics numbers for each 3-month period this year  (2020) because for some reason GA restricts segment view windows to 93 days.</p>
<h2 id="january-4th---april-2nd">January 4th - April 2nd</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-04-02-2020.png" alt="January 4th - April 2nd"></p>
<p>You can see our clear, breakaway winner here is our experience with the <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">Stripe Atlas program</a>, a part blow-by-blow business accounting, part love letter to Stripe and this beautiful business-in-a-box tool it's made for small businesses like us. The other top pages are just runoff from the Stripe article, my poor <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/a-blog-in-five-functions">blog architecture</a> post barely scraping the top 10.</p>
<h2 id="april-3rd---july-4th">April 3rd - July 4th</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-04-03-2020-07-04-2020.png" alt="April 3rd - July 4th"></p>
<p>This period is a bit more mixed - Hacker News users love Tailwind (surprise!) and are interested in their <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/top-concerns-when-choosing-a-tech-stack-for-your-personal-website">personal stack</a> but otherwise the top pages are just a set of basic application workhorses indicating we're starting to get some more traction in everyday use.</p>
<h2 id="july-5th---october-5th">July 5th - October 5th</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-07-05-2020-10-05-2020.png" alt="July 5th - October 5th"></p>
<p>Once again our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits.png">latest experience with Stripe</a> proved a pretty interesting piece of content to the denizens of Hacker News, as enamored they are with Stripe, like all developers (including us!). This episode relies on the sending of a fateful email, but you can read through the whole thread for the full account.</p>
<h2 id="october-6th---december-31st">October 6th - December 31st</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-10-06-2020-12-31-2020.png" alt="October 6th - December 31st"></p>
<p><em>Whomp whomp</em>. You can see this period we did a fraction of our normal HN traffic, which happened because we made a big push to rollout our new file support system(!) (Check out the <a href="https://formcake.com/changelog">changelog</a> for other improvements) that pretty much sucked the life out of anything else (including new blog posts).</p>
<h2 id="the-full-view">The Full View</h2>
<p>So what does this year look like generally, outside of just HN users?</p>
<p>This is what the pageviews look like for all traffic:</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-12-31-2020-overview.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Admittedly, though it's interesting and I think useful in other ways to have information on application usage, let's segment it out in just this case to only show us the performance of <code>/blog</code> pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-12-31-2020-overview-blog.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our top three Stripe pieces account for the overwhelming amount of our traffic, at 84% of all unique pageviews.</p>
<p>Funny enough though, our next top contender, on the basis of strong organic traffic, is a simple, short-and-sweet technical article on a topic I found troublesome and surprisingly under-documented - <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/adding-a-single-page-to-hugo">adding a single page to a site powered by Hugo</a>, the static site generator.</p>
<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<p>Again, we <em>love</em> Hacker News. Getting anyone from HN to follow an accounting of our small business feels particularly validating.</p>
<p>We have big plans this year - for expanding the app, our online presence, and our internal processes. <a href="https://formcake.com/feed.xml">Subscribe to our RSS feed</a> or, sign-up to the email list below, or, you know, just check back sometime for more about it all!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>COVID-19 created circumstances where many businesses were forced to be flexible or shut down entirely. When no childcare or in-person school was available for workers during government-prompted shutdowns, most businesses knew better than to crack down harshly on parents who still had caregiving duties they couldn't avoid during the workday. Instead, many businesses created an unprecedented level of flexibility, allowing dual-income families, for instance, to shift what time of day or which days of the week when they completed their hours.</p><p>The strong recommendation that workers work from home when possible also changed how businesses viewed workplace flexibility. Rather than seeing work from home as a logistical barrier that they weren't willing to work around, they saw it as the best, most efficient way to keep workers safe while still creating value for the company.</p><p>Shorter work weeks have remained less common than the 5-day work week because of, among other things, distrust among leaders and worries about logistical hassle, despite strong research that many companies grow productivity and job satisfaction when they choose a four day work week. Here are some of the reasons why these hurdles were lowered by the experiences that businesses had in 2020.</p><h2 id="productivity-targets-covid-19-shutdowns-and-caregiving-responsibilities">Productivity Targets, COVID-19 Shutdowns, and Caregiving Responsibilities</h2><p>Not everyone thrived in the work-from-home, somewhat-more-flexible schedule of 2020, but many managers were impressed to discover that their team members were managing to efficiently allocate their work, get things done on time and up to standards, all while handling an impressive array of stressors in their personal lives or caregiving responsibilities for children. Companies who had previously assumed that giving team members greater autonomy and less time in the office total would tank productivity saw that they were wrong.</p><p>Even after schools are fully open and it becomes an expectation that team members will not have any caregiving duties during their work shifts, the lessons of this time period will linger with managers and other workplace leadership. The fact that having to get everything done in the time available was a powerful motivator is part of why research shows that workers with 4 day work weeks actually produce as much or more than their 5 day a week counterparts. When there are constraints on our time, we work smarter, not just harder, to get everything done.</p><h2 id="offering-flexibility-has-proven-its-track-record">Offering Flexibility Has Proven Its Track Record</h2><p>Some companies, realizing that the whole world was experiencing more health anxiety and isolation during COVID-19, made it their mission to remove barriers and make it easier for team members to get their work done. From making in-office work optional (to keep density of people working in the office low) to letting people log their hours any time as long as they got done each week, workplaces tried out unprecedented flexibility and got the chance to create a track record. Of course, managers had to modify their structures, figuring out how to do remote meetings well and making sure they knew if a team member was struggling, but in so many cases, the results were strong because team members were grateful for the flexibility. When we like a perk at work, we work hard to convince leadership to keep that perk. After COVID-19, workers everywhere will be able to point to their performance during a flexible work schedule and say, "see? I personally benefited and the company benefitted too."</p><h2 id="time-with-family-has-proven-valuable-to-many-workers">Time With Family Has Proven Valuable to Many Workers</h2><p>Shorter work weeks have also traditionally been rare partly because some workers say to themselves, "More time at home? What would I do with that?" Even very busy people have been so conditioned to assume that all day every day is for being at work. They couldn't imagine what a slower pace of life might look like.</p><p>Now, not everyone was happy to be at home with whoever they lived with during the pandemic. However, quite a lot of people came to the realization that spending time with roommates or family members slowed them down and reduced their stress. When workplaces were in a lull as the government made decisions about how to proceed, people noticed that they could focus on other things that mattered to them. Workers who previously didn't bat an eye at 50 or 60 hour work weeks may now see a shorter work week as a benefit they could enjoy and take advantage of in the futures.</p><p>As a result of this increased value for shorter work weeks, employers are more likely to see the logistical hurdles as worthwhile for the gains in employee retention and satisfaction.</p><h2 id="the-2020-experiment-prompts-further-experimentation">The 2020 Experiment Prompts Further Experimentation</h2><p>Not every company gave their teams flexibility specifically in the length of the workweek during 2020. Instead, they may have experimented with using more online tools, telecommuting for business meetings, or other strategies that created surprising savings while still allowing the job to get done. Companies whose 'new normal' includes some forms of workplace flexibility will have a harder time turning down other forms of experimentation going forward, especially with so much evidence that shorter work weeks are good for both the team members and the bottom line at the company.</p><p>Trying an experiment with shorter work weeks is likely to be met with enthusiasm among workers, especially when they are designed in a simple, elegant way that doesn't decrease customer experience or make life difficult for payroll or other parts of the company. When you handle issues of what to do when you have a question for someone on their day off and other small concerns, it's easier than you think to implement a pilot program and see what happens. Yes, there are companies that find that four day work weeks clash with their culture, but far more find that the motivation factor, the job satisfaction, and the resulting recruiting power are major benefits.</p><p>Whether 2021 brings more of the same challenges that 2020 brought or results in even more upheaval, companies that are willing to re-evaluate the status quo will be able to confront future challenges with better results.</p>

This normally means that it isn’t possible to encode the color and it needs to be adjusted somehow before being displayed or encoded (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScRGB">scRGB</a> is an example of an exception, and has a different range). The range of supported colors in a color spaces is referred to as a its <em>gamut</em>.</p><p>Many of the colors outside the gamut are still valid colors, they just can’t be encoded in the given color space. The colors that can’t be encoded can be categorized as follows (for RGB color spaces without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Imaginary_colors">imaginary primaries</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>One or more RGB values are larger than one, but none are negative</strong><br>These colors are too bright for the color space, but could be encoded at a lower luminance.</li><li><strong>One or more negative values</strong><br>These color are more colorful than the color space is able to encode. Some of these can be real colors, but they can also be colors more colorful than physically possible. This is a consequence of linear encoding of colors, which is able to encode colors that can’t exist in real life.</li></ul><p>The simplest technique for dealing with colors outside the valid range is to simply clamp <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> individually. The simplicity of this makes the technique widespread, but unfortunately it has significant drawbacks and can lead to unpleasant color distortions.</p><p>Here is an example of taking a photo and increasing its exposure and colorfulness significantly, with results displayed as sRGB. Colorfulness has been increased by scaling <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> chroma. RGB values here are simply clamped to the 0.0 to 1.0 range.</p><br><div><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg"><img alt="Original" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Unprocessed</em></p><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg"><img alt="Processed" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Processed with out of range values clamped</em></p></div><p>This is of course problematic. Hues are heavily distorted and all the details in the flowers are gone. Better methods are needed. Thankfully, this problem isn’t new and has been researched a lot over the years.</p><p>Two main research topics exist:</p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping">Tone mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping high dynamic range images to a lower dynamic range. This typically involves altering both colors inside and outside the gamut and sometimes involves different kinds of spatial filtering to keep details while reducing overall dynamic range.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Gamut_mapping">Gamut mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping colors from one color space to another and dealing with the mismatch in what colors can be encoded. This can either be done using <em>gamut compression</em> or <em>gamut expansion</em>, which adjusts all colors of an image, or using <em>gamut clipping</em>, which leaves colors that exist in both color spaces intact, while mapping colors outside the gamut back in range. For an overview see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">“The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey”</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Tone mapping, gamut expansion and gamut compression are all useful techniques, but will not be the focus of this article. Instead we will limit the scope to creating a practical alternative to clipping sRGB values, by looking at gamut clipping in the sRGB color space and on relatively simple, robust and portable algorithms. The source code for the operations shown is also available, at the <a href="#source-code">end of the article</a>.</p><p>The techniques investigated are also, with some additional work, applicable to other color spaces, and some of the building blocks can be for other things, such as gamut compression. Combining gamut clipping with tone mapping can also be useful since some tone mapping techniques may still produce colors outside the target gamut.</p><h2 id="gamut-clipping">Gamut Clipping <a href="#gamut-clipping"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h2><p>The goal of gamut clipping is to take colors that are outside the target gamut, and map them back to valid colors in a way that avoids perceived distortion and artifacts. In this article we also want to do this in a way that is reasonably efficient and simple to implement. Many techniques require complex iterative algorithms per pixel (or storing the results in 3D lookup tables) – those will not be considered here, but can be useful for many applications.</p><p>Instead we will take this commonly used approach:</p><ul><li>Work in a perceptual color space.</li><li>Keep hue constant, only change lightness and chroma.</li><li>Only project color along straight lines in the perceptual color space.</li></ul><p>For an overview of different approaches, see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey</a>.</p><p>As a color space, we will use the <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> perceptual color space, since it models hue, chroma and lightness well while being easy to work with mathematically. In particular, with Oklab, the shape of the gamut of an RGB color space is described by cubic polynomials, which are quite practical to work with compared to the equations you get with other spaces.</p><p>Since we have decided to keep hue constant, it is now possible to plot the problem in two dimensions, using lightness, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and chroma, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To better understand the shape of the sRGB gamut, let’s look at of slices of constant hue.

The result is two new methods. They are novel as far as I am aware, but there are a lot of gamut mapping papers I haven’t read.</p><p>The first method is based on projection towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>5</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=0.5, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and the second based on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=L_{cusp}, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

	<p>Garbage collectors (GCs) feel like some sort of esoteric programming magic.  What’s really funny is
that a simple good-enough garbage collector is actually quite easy to write.  The core functionality
of a basic tri-color GC is only around 250 lines of C code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The only real hard part about writing a GC is to build the confidence that – yes – <em>you</em> are
capable of writing one!  Really: this isn’t black magic.  If you can write C code, and you
understand pointers and basic bit manipulation, then you’re perfectly capable of understanding and
writing GCs.</p>

<p>I researched a couple different GC algorithms, and settled on a basic tri-color mark-sweep for this
experiment.  I insisted that the GC be incremental so that I could use it in game engines if I
wanted – I didn’t want to have long pauses while the GC was running, which would affect frame rate.</p>

<h2 id="allocation">Allocation</h2>

<p>You would think Garbage Collectors are about collecting garbage.  That’s only half of the equation
though.  The GC begins at <em>allocation</em>.</p>

<p>When you design a garbage collector, you are first designing an allocater.</p>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

<p>Allocation is pretty simple: I preallocate a large table of each type.  For example, I have a string
table, a list table, a hash table, etc.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table.png" alt="Basic Hash Table" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Basic Hash Table
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>For the hash table, each slot in the table contains a <code>size</code>, a pointer to the list of <code>keys</code>, and a
pointer to the list of <code>values</code>.  The pointers are <code>NULL</code> when the slot is unallocated.</p>

<h3 id="bitmaps">Bitmaps</h3>

<p>Next, I use a <em>bitmap</em> to track whether a slot is allocated or not.</p>

<p>Basically a bitmap is a list of 64-bit unsigned integers.  That means for each integer in the
bitmap, I can track 64 slots in my table.  For this reason, I preallocate the tables in multiples
of 64 slots, so that every bit in the bitmap is used.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table2.png" alt="Allocation Bitmap" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Allocation Bitmap
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>If a bit is <code>1</code>, then the corresponding slot is allocated – otherwise, the slot is free to use.</p>

<h3 id="allocation-algorithm">Allocation Algorithm</h3>

<p>At this point, it’s pretty obvious how allocation would work: if we need a new hash, then scan the
allocation bitmap for a <code>0</code>.  The first <code>0</code> we find will give us the slot to use.</p>

<p>Then, set the bit to <code>1</code> to indicate that the slot is now allocated, and return the slot.</p>

<p>The only trick here is to scan the allocation bitmap quickly: we can check 64 slots at a time by
just seeing if the allocation integer is <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL</code> (64-bit unsigned int with all bits
set).</p>

<p>Once we find a non-full integer, then find the first bit inside the integer that is a <code>0</code>.  Turns
out the C function <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ffs.3.html"><code>ffsll</code></a> finds the first <code>1</code>
pretty damn quickly, so we just need to bit-not (<code>~</code>), and search for <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>(<code>ffsll</code> also starts counting at 1, but we want to start counting at 0, so we subtract 1)</p>

<p>Here’s the allocation code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int64_t</span> <span>bmp_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>bmp</span><span>,</span> <span>int64_t</span> <span>slots</span><span>){</span>
  <span>// search for the first 0 bit, set it to 1,</span>
  <span>// then return the slot</span>
  <span>// return -1 if nothing found</span>
  <span>slots</span> <span>/=</span> <span>64</span><span>;</span> <span>// checking 64 slots at a time</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int64_t</span> <span>loop</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>loop</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>slots</span><span>;</span> <span>loop</span><span>++</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>bmp</span> <span>==</span> <span>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL</span><span>){</span>
      <span>// this area is full, go to the next area</span>
      <span>bmp</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
      <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// we're guaranteed at least one bit is 0</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>ffsll</span><span>(</span><span>~*</span><span>bmp</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>*</span><span>bmp</span> <span>|=</span> <span>1LL</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span> <span>// set the bit at pos</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>loop</span> <span>*</span> <span>64</span> <span>+</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopefully that isn’t too scary for you.  It’s just what I’ve described.</p>

<p>The only thing left is when <code>bmp_alloc</code> returns <code>-1</code>, that means our table is completely full, so we
need to grow our table and bitmap.  That’s just a matter of <code>realloc</code> and <code>memset</code>.</p>

<p>And that’s it for allocation!  See, writing your own allocater isn’t that hard :-).</p>

<h2 id="marksweep">Mark/Sweep</h2>

<p>Now we get to the core algorithm.</p>

<p>Mark/sweep is dead simple – our goal is to traverse all the values to see what is reachable from
the machine.  After we’re done traversing, whatever is allocated <em>but unreachable</em> needs to be
deallocated.</p>

<p>So if you think about it, this is what we need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A way to mark that we’ve visited a value</li>
  <li>A way to crack open a value and visit everything inside</li>
  <li>A starting point</li>
</ol>

<p>The basic algorithm will be:</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-start">Phase 1: Start</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Clear the mark on all values, everywhere</li>
  <li>Create a list of values that need to be processed (the “pending” list)</li>
  <li>Add the starting values to the pending list, marking them</li>
  <li>Go to phase 2</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="phase-2-mark">Phase 2: Mark</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Pull a value off the pending list</li>
  <li>Crack it open and traverse all the values inside of it</li>
  <li>For each child value, if it is already marked, ignore it; if it isn’t marked, mark it, and add
it to the pending list</li>
  <li>Keep pulling values off the pending list and processing them until the list is empty – then go
to phase 3</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="phase-3-sweep">Phase 3: Sweep</h4>

<ol>
  <li>For every allocated value, check to see if it’s marked</li>
  <li>If a value isn’t marked, then free any memory associated with the object, and clear the
allocation bit of its slot, so it can be reused</li>
  <li>Go back to phase 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure this makes sense!</p>

<p>The final code won’t look exactly like this, but this is the essence of the algorithm.  Convince
yourself that this algorithm <em>works</em>.</p>

<p>It’s important to truly and deeply understand this core algorithm, because later we’re going to have
to figure out how to make this incremental without screwing it up.</p>

<h2 id="referenced-bitmap">Referenced Bitmap</h2>

<p>So, it looks like we’ll need a way to mark each value.  Let’s use another bitmap.</p>

<p>For each table, in addition to the allocation bitmap, we’ll have a referenced bitmap.  The
referenced bitmap will have a <code>1</code> if the value is marked, indicating that it is reachable from the
starting point.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table3.png" alt="Referenced Bitmap" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Referenced Bitmap
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>This might seem a bit weird to use these bitmaps – why not just put an allocation bool and a
referenced bool inside of each slot in the table?</p>

<p>Speed, of course.</p>

<p>Remember that our allocation algorithm could check 64 slots at a time – it didn’t have to run down
each slot and look at each individual bool.  We’ll see more bit tricks that will speed up
deallocation later.</p>

<h2 id="starting-point">Starting Point</h2>

<p>Where do you start?  That depends on your VM.</p>

<p>This experimental VM is a register based machine.  That means I have instructions like
<code>R3 = StrCat R2, R0</code>, which says “create a new string by concatenating the strings in register 2 and
register 0, and store the result in register 3”.</p>

<p>The key insight is that the registers alone work as a starting point.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>The only way to reach an object is if the object is in one of the registers, <em>or</em> if you can
traverse to the object using what’s already in the registers.</p>

<p>So, if we use the registers as our starting point, our Mark phase will do the same traversal as
<em>any possible instruction sequence</em>, which guarantees that we won’t accidentally deallocate
something our VM could use.</p>

<h2 id="adding-to-the-pending-list">Adding to the Pending List</h2>

<p>One more thing…</p>

<p>We’ll be adding a lot of things to the pending list, in a lot of different scenarios, so it’s best
to think about solving the general case.</p>

<p>Suppose you are simply given a list of values.  How would you determine if they should be added to
the pending list?</p>

<p>The value’s type must be checked, and categorized into three basic buckets:</p>

<h3 id="non-allocated-values">Non-allocated Values</h3>

<p>If the value is <code>void</code>, <code>null</code>, boolean, or a number, then it’s skipped entirely: the GC doesn’t
operate on these values, because they aren’t allocated in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="allocated-but-non-traversable">Allocated but Non-traversable</h3>

<p>If the value can’t be traversed, then it’s marked, but it isn’t put on the pending list.  Why put
something on the pending list if it doesn’t have any child values?  Think of a string: yes, it’s
allocated, but you can’t crack it open and find more values inside of it.</p>

<h3 id="allocated-and-traversable">Allocated and Traversable</h3>

<p>Lastly, we have values that are allocated and can be traversed – these are things like lists and
hashes.</p>

<p>If the value is already marked, then we ignore it.  That’s because if it’s marked, that means it’s
already been processed, so we don’t want to process it all over again.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <em>finally</em>, at this point, we mark the value, and add it to the pending list.  This is the
only situation where a value is added to the pending list.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Here is a basic implementation.  I call the function <code>gc_add_gray</code> because in traditional GC
terminology, adding something to the pending list is “coloring it gray”. Silly, I know, but we’re
stuck with it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>gc_add_gray</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span><span>vals</span><span>){</span>

  <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>vals_filtered</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-1-start-1">Phase 1: Start</h2>

<p>Now, it should be obvious how to implement Phase 1.</p>

<p>Clearing the mark for all values is easy, just <code>memset</code> the entire referenced bitmap to <code>0</code> for each
table.</p>

<p>Creating the pending list is easy… something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>pending_list_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>pending_list_total</span> <span>=</span> <span>256</span><span>;</span>
<span>value</span> <span>*</span><span>pending_list</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>pending_list_total</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is your basic variable length list implementation in C.  Nothing new here.</p>

<p>(In practice, the pending list is only created once, and we just empty it here by setting
<code>pending_list_size</code> to <code>0</code>)</p>

<p>Adding the registers is cake too!</p>

<p>Something like: <code>gc_add_gray(registers_size, registers);</code></p>

<h2 id="phase-2-mark-1">Phase 2: Mark</h2>

<p>This is now pretty simple because we’re guaranteed only traversable values end up on the pending</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>In the hours following a massive data leak where data from <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/brazils-health-ministrys-website-data-leak-exposed-243-million-medical-records-for-more-than-6-months/">almost all Brazilians</a> was exposed, users of the only industry where kind of mass security failure routinely happens concluded there was no way to prevent such breaches from taking place. “This is literally hundreds of millions of people, but sometimes these things happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them”, said Bark Megor, echoing sentiments expressed by millions of individuals who post their names, religion, sexuality and personal information into centralized computer networks in order to send cat memes to one another. “And besides,” he continued, “this only happened because some employee uploaded a spreadsheet with usernames, passwords and access keys <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/personal-data-of-16-million-brazilian-covid-19-patients-exposed-online/">into a GitHub repository</a>. Mistakes do happen, after all.”</p>
<p>The incident follows a long string of similar incidents. Some are due to sophisticated hacking, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach">the Yahoo breaches in 2013 and 2014 of all 3 billion accounts on the site</a>, including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords, and in some cases, personal security questions and answers. Others are due to mere incompetence of a subcontractor, as the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/data-on-123-million-us-households-exposed-due-to-misconfigured-aws-s3-bucket">2017 Equifax leak of nearly all US households</a> or in the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-vast-breach-likud-campaign-leaks-id-phones-addresses-of-all-israeli-adults/">2020 leak in the Likud Party of names, ID, phones, addresses of all Israeli adults</a>. “You’d think every person in the world would have their name, address and personal information out there by now,” said Larissa Layer, “pretty soon we will reach herd immunity to doxxing so maybe it doesn’t matter so much?”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame, but what can we do?” asks Wenin Denig, quizically raising his eyebrow. “It’s not like we have some kind of  <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html"><strong>alternative open source platform that lets each person and organization control their own data</strong></a>. ” When asked about WordPress, <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/#:~:text=WordPress'%20market%20share%20is%2039,one%2Dthird%20of%20the%20web!">which powers 4 in 10 websites in the world</a>, he exclaimed, “Are you kidding? I want videoconferencing, chats, events, payments, profiles, and I want it all in real time with slick notifications. If I am going to check my phone 10 times a day, and share the latest controversy with my friends it’s definitely not going to be on that old software. That’s the modern internet industry. But they better beware, if WhatsApp wants to sell my data, I’ll show them!” At press time, millions of people around the world were seen switching from WhatsApp to Telegram and Signal, in an effort to escape putting all their data, conversations, money and votes in one place.</p>

<p>One of the interesting Amateur cubesats in yesterday’s <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-143-satellites-transporter-1-rocket-landing">SpaceX Transporter-1 launch</a> from Cape Canaveral is <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ideassat.htm">IDEASSat</a>, a 3U cubesat from the <a href="https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en">National Central University of the Republic of China</a> (Taiwan) designed to study ionospheric plasma. <a href="https://twitter.com/pe0sat">Jan van Gils PE0SAT</a> drew my attention to this satellite as he was <a href="https://twitter.com/pe0sat/status/1353418234679103489">trying to see</a> if it was possible to decode it with any of the decoders existing in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites">gr-satellites</a>. <a href="https://www.dk3wn.info/wp/">Mike Rupprecht DK3WN</a> also helped with a good recording, much cleaner than the SatNOGS recording that Jan was using.</p>



<p>Presumably this satellite uses “AX25, 9k6, GMSK”, as listed at the bottom of this page from <a href="https://www.nspo.narl.org.tw/inprogress.php?c=20030402&amp;ln=en">Taiwan’s National Space Organization</a>, and also in <a href="https://irsl.ss.ncu.edu.tw/media/paper/2020281.pdf">this research paper</a>. However, this is not true. It’s simple to check that the usual 9k6 FSK AX.25 decoders aren’t able to decode this signal, and a look at the FSK symbols shows that there is no scrambler (9k6 AX.25 uses the G3RUH scrambler) and that the symbol sequence doesn’t have much to do with AX.25.</p>



<p>After some reverse-enginnering, yesterday I figured out how the coding used by IDEASSat worked, and today I <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/commit/17be909a338f0a8fe4b9931cc672d7453cff2d52">added a decoder to gr-satellites</a> to help Mike investigate what kind of telemetry the packets contain. The protocol is not very good, so I think it’s interesting to document it in detail, as some sort of lessons learned. In this post I’ll do so. As it turns out, the protocol has some elements that loosely resemble AX.25, so I’m left wondering whether this is some unsuccessful attempt at implementing standard AX.25 (we’ve already seen very weird attempts, <a href="https://destevez.net/2018/12/decoding-eseo/">such as ESEO</a>).</p>



<p>An excerpt of the recording that Mike sent me can be found as <code><a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/satellite-recordings/blob/master/ideassat.wav">ideassat.wav</a></code> in my <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/satellite-recordings">satellite-recordings repo</a>. From the recording, which is already FM-demodulated, it is clear that the modulation is 9k6 FSK.</p>



<p>The first thing that shocked me when looking at Mike’s recording is that there doesn’t seem to be any preamble. The packet starts directly with the data, as shown here. This is very bad, because closed-loop clock recovery algorithms need a preamble to lock to the symbol clock.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble.png"><img src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-644x78.png" alt="" width="610" height="73" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-644x78.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-300x36.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-768x93.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble.png 1499w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"></a><figcaption>Beginning of an IDEASSat burst</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is another bad thing about the FSK burst. If we look at the full burst, we see that before and after the burst there is a part that starts negative and slowly decays exponentially to zero.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full.png"><img width="644" height="77" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-644x77.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-644x77.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-300x36.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-768x92.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full.png 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Full IDEASSat burst</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is caused by the fact that the FSK low tone is held for some 100ms before and after the FSK burst. Doing this at the beginning of the burst is a bad idea. Most FSK demodulators are AC coupled. Even the digital ones, as they use this to correct for frequency errors. So if one of the FSK tones is held for a significant amount of time, AC coupling will drive this tone to zero (just as we see with Mike’s recording). Thus, when the FSK burst starts, it will do so with a large DC offset, as we can see in the first figure.</p>



<p>In any case, all these problems can be sorted out (at least for manual inspection) by using a DC block in <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a> to correct for the DC offset at the beginning of the burst and <a href="http://www.ossmann.com/mike/">Mike Ossman’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/mossmann/clock-recovery">whole packet clock recovery script</a> to extract all the symbols in the burst regardless of the lack of preamble.</p>



<p>After looking at the symbols for a while with <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, I realized that they were NRZ-I encoded UART-like data. By NRZ-I I mean the usual differential encoding from AX.25, where a 0 is encoded as a symbol change and a 1 is encoded as no symbol change. I say UART-like because it is exactly like 8-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter#Data_framing">UART</a> with one stop bit and no parity (1N8 for short) except for the fact that bytes are transmitted most-significant-bit first, whereas most UART transmit bytes in least-significant-bit first ordering.</p>



<p>The clues that lead me to this conclusion are the following:</p>



<ul><li>Differential decoding yields a richer autocorrelation than if we don’t do differential decoding; it’s always handy to see how differential decoding changes the autocorrelation</li><li>After differential decoding, the autocorrelation showed peaks every 10 bits, and much larger peaks every 400 bits (which I’ll explain later)</li><li>Arranging the symbols in 10 bit segments, there were two adjacent bits that had constant and opposite values; these strongly suggest the stop and start bits of UART</li><li>The fact that the start bit of UART must be zero and the stop bit must be one indicates NRZ-I rather than plain differential decoding (the two are related by a bitwise inversion)</li><li>When interpreting the UART bytes as most-significant-bit first, I got ASCII data</li></ul>



<p>When decoded as NRZ-I 1N8 MSB UART, I got the following data in hex. The line breaks are mine for clarity and I’ve corrected a few obvious bit errors at the beginning by hand.</p>

<p>We see that the burst consists of 18 frames which are delimited by <code>0x7e</code> at the beginning and end. These resemble the HDLC flags. However, there aren’t any other aspects of HDLC such as bit stuffing or the CRC-16. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any CRC that can be used to discard frames with bit errors. Frames have 40 bytes, and begin in the same way, which explains the strong autocorrelation at lags of 400 bits and multiples (recall that with 1N8 UART we have 10 bits per byte).</p>



<p>Now, the beginning of the frames is ASCII for</p>



<pre>BN0CU 0BN0IDA0</pre>



<p>These are almost like the AX.25 destination and source addresses (with a SSID of 0) that occur at the beginning of the AX.25 header. However, in <a href="http://www.ax25.net/AX25.2.2-Jul%2098-2.pdf">standard AX.25</a> these should be written in the 7 MSBs of each byte (so they don’t look like ASCII text), whereas in IDEASSat these are written in the 7 LSBs of each byte. I’ve encountered this misunderstanding about AX.25 address fields in other occasions.</p>



<p>After the two “addresses”, we have the byte <code>f0</code>, which probably is the PID field with the <em>No Layer 3 protocol</em> value. However, the control field byte, which in standard AX.25 is placed between the addresses and the PID, would be missing.</p>



<p>After the “PID field” we have 23 bytes of what seems to be telemetry. We don’t have a description for the telemetry format. However, it seems that the first of these 23 bytes is a counter that counts from 0 to 8 and iterates through 9 different telemetry structures. Most of the telemetry values seem simple 8-bit signed channels, and structure number 5 contains the ASCII string <code>B0BMFUN</code>. In this example burst, each of the two repetitions of each telemetry structure contains the same values. Probably this is always the case to increase the reliability.</p>



<p>So how does the IDEASSat gr-satellites <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#deframers">deframer</a> work? Well, first off, I don’t think that the protocol used by IDEASSat is very good for transmitting data over RF. In fact it is not robust at all, and bit errors will cause all sorts of problems. </p>



<p>Besides the problem of the lack of preamble, using UART over RF is never a good idea. The state machine that tracks start and stop bits is prone to fall into all sorts of traps because of bit errors (unless a very complicate state machine is used). Incidentally, using UART, with or without NRZ-I, guarantees a bit transition every 10 bits, so at least this is good for clock recovery.</p>



<p>The use of <code>0x7e</code> to delimit frames can create a problem if that byte appears in the data (or even if it appears as a cause of bit errors). Finally, there is no means to check if decoded packets are corrupt.</p>



<p>I’m sure that with effort it would be possible to create a somewhat smart decoder for this protocol. Whole packet clock recovery could be used to prevent the problems caused by the lack of preamble. After NRZ-I decoding, the bits could be correlated against the expected UART start and stop bits for robust byte synchronization. If we use the fact that frames are 40 bytes long, then frame synchronization can also be made robust by finding several <code>0x7e</code> bytes (maybe correlating against the 36 <code>0x7e</code> bytes that we know should appear in an 18 frame burst). And finally the bit errors in the UART start and stop bits could be used as a heuristic of how many bit errors there were in the useful data, as a means to discard garbage frames. However, I don’t think it’s worth the effort. In the end, this protocol doesn’t have any FEC, and it is something ad-hoc used by just one satellite.</p>



<p>Therefore, today I decided to write a much simpler deframer for gr-satellites, with the goal of not investing much effort and having quickly something ready that Mike could use to start decoding frames.</p>



<p>The decoder in gr-satellites uses the standard <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#fsk-demodulator">FSK demodulator</a>, which does closed-loop clock recovery with the <a href="https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Symbol_Sync">Symbol sync block</a>. The FSK symbols are NRZ-I decoded and then the sequence <code>00111111010011…</code></p></div></article></div>

    <p><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/scnow/name/brad-cox-obituary?pid=197454225">Dr. Brad J. Cox Ph.D. 1944 - 2021</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Brad Cox, Ph.D of Manassas, Virginia, died on January 2, 2021 at his residence. Dr. Cox was a computer scientist known mostly for creating the Objective – C programming language with his business partner, Tom Love, and for his work in software engineering (specifically software reuse) and software componentry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had always struggled building apps for the Mac, first in Classic MacOS and then in Mac OS X. I used Java, I used REALbasic, and I even had a professional license for Metrowerk's CodeWarrior so I could write apps in C or C++. But there was always some sort of mental block, or maybe the way my brain worked never really lined up with the way these programming languages did. Out of these I was most efficient with Java, but the UI toolkit was pretty lacking.</p>
<p>Then I saw these cool apps coming out for Mac OS X, and they were proudly written in Objective-C.</p>
<p>I took a couple of runs at it.  The brackets and pointers threw me off, but I kept on trying because I knew I needed to learn this language to build the apps I wanted to see in this world.</p>
<p>And then one day, I believe when plugging away on my little internet search utility <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030204023115/http://www.flyingmeat.com/vnk/">VoodooNetKey</a>, everything clicked.</p>
<p>Pointers, the brackets, selectors, messages. Oh my god, I get it now — the brackets! It's not a function call, it's something way better!</p>
<p>Everything just sort of aligned in my brain. Previously I found myself struggling to express the ideas I had in my head, and it was a frustrating experience. Now I was struggling to type fast enough and come up with new ideas that I could express in Objective-C. I felt like I could do anything I wanted with it.</p>
<p>And loadable bundles, and input managers- I can't express to you about how much fun it was being able to inject my Objective-C code into Safari or other applications to add functionality at runtime. Or using class-dump against the system frameworks to explore private methods. NSObject's <code>performSelector:</code> was just so great when you needed to quickly hack around something.</p>
<p>Objective-C was brilliant, powerful, and elegant.</p>
<p>All my applications are written in Objective-C even to this day. I play around in other languages from time to time, but I haven't found one that fits me like Objective-C does.</p>
<p>I realize it's not for everyone, and that Objective-C requires discipline, but it's been amazing for me. I owe my career in part to Brad Cox's creation, and I am forever grateful for it.</p>

<p>The following draft is concerned with the curious use of the nickname 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish between around 1815 and the First World War saw what has been termed the 'wholescale scattering' of the Cornish to the new mining frontiers of North and South America, Australia and South Africa. From at least the mid-nineteenth century, these emigrants were known as 'Cousin Jacks', but the origin of this term seems rather obscure. The aim of the following note is to investigate the evidence for the early usage of the term 'Cousin Jack' and make some suggestions as to its origins in light of this evidence.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/s952/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg"><img data-original-height="952" data-original-width="806" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/w339-h400/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg" width="424"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The cover of Oswald Pryor's <i>Cousin Jack Cartoons</i>&nbsp;(Sydney, 1945); Pryor was the son of Cornish parents and born at Moonta, South Australia. The books says the following of the front cover image: 'The cover design suggests a miner who has knocked off early, and has come up a ladderway remote from the main shaft in order to avoid running into the boss. Unfortunately he has run into the trouble he meant to avoid. This situation will be, obvious to all who know the Moonta scene. —The miner's hat here depicted is made of hard compressed pulp and colored a deep maroon when new. The candle is stuck on the front of the hat with a lump of wet red clay. This was the practice of old Cornish miners for generations.' (Image: <a href="http://search.slv.vic.gov.au/primo-explore/fulldisplay?vid=MAIN&amp;docid=SLV_VOYAGER951330&amp;context=L">State Library of Victoria</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries seems to have occurred on a quite remarkable scale. Margaret James-Korany has, for example, identified 42,000 individual emigrants sailing from the principal ports of Cornwall for Canada between 1831 and 1860, with some 6,200 leaving from Padstow alone in that period, and this outflow continued long after 1860 too. Thus the&nbsp;<i>Cornish Telegraph</i>&nbsp;for 5 September 1866 published a piece regretting 'the rage for emigration' in recent years, noting that 'the rush for Australia and America has been very great', and recent calculations suggest that at least 240,000 Cornish went overseas between 1860 and 1900, with a similar number leaving for England and Wales, with the result that Cornwall lost around a third of its population across the period. This depopulation was particularly marked amongst the youngest age-groups. Philip Payton observes that 44.8% of the Cornish male population aged fifteen to twenty-four left for overseas between 1861 and 1900, along with 26.2% of the female population in the same age group, and another 30% and 35.5% respectively left for other counties within Britain as well.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn1">1</a>)</p><p>The use of the term 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish, particularly miners and especially emigrant miners, along with its companion-term 'Cousin Jenny', is well-evidenced from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards. John H. Forster's account of 'Life in the copper mines of Lake Superior', given to the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society in 1887, contains the following illustrative passage:</p><blockquote><p>The Cornishman, or "<b><u>cousin Jack</u></b>," is a native of the duchy of Cornwall, England... The Cornishman of the present day, like his father, is of a roving disposition. His footsteps may be traced around the globe. There is no prominent mining field in the world wherein you will not find "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>." He is in Alaska, California, the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, Central and South America, in Australia, India and Lake Superior. He is a first rate miner and possesses a certain sturdiness of frame and disposition that commends him to the observer. He works hard, eats well and fights bravely. He is, numerically, very strong in our northern mines, and, being, as a rule, steady, conservative and skillful, he finds ready employment. He likes mining; esteems his vocation among the most honorable, if not aristocratic. He despises the duties of an ordinary day laborer. In short, he is a born miner and nothing else... But "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>'s" language attracts most attention. His dialect, pure and simple, is unique. He uses many English words with a strange twist, while other words of his you would look for in vain in Webster's unabridged... But we find in the mines many gentlemen of Cornish birth who are well educated and efficient, occupying positions of trust and responsibility. Many of the captains and agents are Cornishmen.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn2">2</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Quite when and where these Cornish emigrants started to be known as 'Cousin Jacks' is not wholly clear, unfortunately, and various theories have been proposed over the years, most of which locate the genesis of the term overseas in America, Australia or other places where Cornish miners emigrated to in the nineteenth century. The&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times</i>&nbsp;in 1908, for example, carried a piece suggesting that the term 'Cousin Jack' was first used in the California mining districts in the very late 1840s and spread out from there, with the additional claim that 'twenty years ago the term in Cornwall was unknown'; however, as we shall see, neither claim stands up to scrutiny, and the reality is perhaps even more interesting.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn3">3</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1241/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"><img data-original-height="1241" data-original-width="1000" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/w323-h400/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>An Australian Cousin Jack cartoon by Oswald Pryor from 1915; the caption reads 'Cousin Jack miner:- "Call isself Cap'n 'e do; and I 'spoase ef the truth ez known, 'e never did a day's work underground in all 'ez life."' (Image: <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-133090696/view">Trove</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking at the documentary evidence for the usage of the term, a traditional place to start is with the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, which&nbsp;cites a number of examples of the use of Cousin Jack under their <i>Cousin, n.</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Jack, n.¹</i>&nbsp;entries. One, from Rolf Boldrewood's Australian novel&nbsp;<i>Miner's Right</i>&nbsp;of 1890, describes 'a short man, whose blue-black curly hair and deep-set eyes betrayed the Cousin Jack',(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn4">4</a>) whilst the earliest given is from&nbsp;<i>The Star</i> newspaper&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ballarat, Victoria (Australia) on the 19 March 1857, which runs as follows:</p><blockquote><p>They were ‘Tips’, and ‘Geordies’, and ‘<b><u>Cousin Jacks</u></b>’, altogether, and I did as well as I could.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn5">5</a>)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The fact that both of the early citations are from Australia has sometimes been taken to suggest that the term could have emerged there, and it is certainly treated as such by the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>&nbsp;under&nbsp;its entry for&nbsp;<i>Cousin</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn6">6</a>) In addition to these entries, the <i>OED </i>also records what it treats as a variant of Cousin Jack, <i>Cousin Jacky.</i> This is said to be documented first in the <i>South Australian Register</i>, from Adelaide,<i>&nbsp;</i>for 2 June 1854, via the following passage: 'John O'Connell then said to him, ‘You're a b——, <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>, an't you?'', although the term also occurs in dialogue from Australian court reports of the 1840s too, <i>e.g.</i> 'I don't like <b><u>you cousin Jackies</u></b>, keep your own company, and I'll keep mine', which appeared in the&nbsp;<i>South Australian</i>, 30 May 1848.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn7">7</a>) However, 'Cousin Jacky' is not only documented in Australian contexts; it also appears in, for example, Thomas Quiller Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words</i>, published by the English Dialect Society in 1880, where it is treated as an East Cornwall term for a miner from West Cornwall:</p><blockquote><p>There is a marked difference between the speech of East and West Cornwall... At the beginning of the present century mining adventure, especially in the search for copper, became a furor in East Cornwall, and a passionate enthusiasm brought hither the skilled miners of the West, who flocked to the banks of Tywardreath Bay, and further east to the central granite ridge about the tors of Caradon. These immigrants brought with them and have left an infusion of their language, especially its technical portion, but I remember when it was a great mimetic feat, and productive of much mirth amongst us, to be able to imitate the talk of <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>&nbsp;from Redruth or St. Just.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn8">8</a>)</p></blockquote><p>T. Q. Couch of Bodmin, the father of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (aka Q), was born in 1826 at Lansallos near Fowey, and seems to be here recounting a usage known to him in his youth, and is clearly referring to someone from West Cornwall, not a Cornish emigrant overseas. Likewise, in a letter printed in the&nbsp;<i>West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser</i> for 28 March 1862, Christopher Childs of Liskeard uses 'Cousin Jacky' in passing as a seemingly well-known, common and friendly term traditionally used between Cornish miners:</p><blockquote><p>The very motto of the Cornish miners, "One and All," at once bespeaks our favour, and indicates that [Cornish miners] are not naturally selfish, but on the contrary, are kindly disposed one toward another. If any one doubt this, let him attend the funeral of a miner, and observe how they congregate to pay the last sad tribute of respect, and drop a tear over the grave of their departed comrade... How forcibly does the familiar name "comrade," and the expression of "<b><u>Com'se along Cousin Jacky</u></b>," speak in favour of his friendly and social disposition.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn9">9</a>)</p></blockquote><p>In contrast, in Margaret Ann Courtney's <i>West Cornwall Words</i>&nbsp;(which was bound together with Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words&nbsp;</i>of 1880), 'Cousin Jacky' features as&nbsp;a local dialect term meaning 'a foolish person, a coward', with 'Cousin Jan' instead being given as the name for Cornishman—the latter variant is discussed further below, as is the former definition for Cousin Jacky.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn10">10</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/s1162/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg"><img data-original-height="862" data-original-width="1162" height="370" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h296/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg" width="500"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The first two pages of Elfin's <i>A Cornish Ghost Story</i>, first published at Truro sometime before 1862; these two pages are taken from an 1868 edition of the text in <i>Cornish Tales in Prose and Verse</i>&nbsp;(Truro: Netherton, 1868), pp. 37<span>–</span>8 (image: <a href="https://archive.org/details/cornishpales00treggoog/page/n243/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Needless to say, the above references do seem to cast serious doubt upon the implication of the report in the&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times&nbsp;</i>in 1908 that the term 'Cousin Jack' and similar was unknown in Cornwall in the late 1880s, and in this light it is worth noting that Sharron Schwartz has, in fact, suggested that the 'evidence seems to point to the mines of Devonshire in the eighteenth century' as the place where the term Cousin Jack originated, via migrant Cornish miners seeking work in Devon rather than overseas.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn11">11</a>) Although she unfortunately offers no citation to …</p></div></div>

        <div>
          <p>A few months ago I experimented with DigitalOcean spaces as my backup solution that could <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">replace Dropbox eventually</a>. That solution worked quite nicely, and I was amazed how smashing together a couple of existing solutions would work this fine.</p>
<p>I have been running that solution in the background for a couple of months now and kind of forgot about it. But recent developments around deplatforming and having us people hostages of technology and big companies speed up my goals to become less dependent on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit/index.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048680/dropbox-takes-a-peek-at-files.html">Dropbox</a> etc and take back some control.</p>
<p>I am not a conspiracy theory nut, but to be honest, what these companies are doing lately is out of control. It is a matter of principle at this point. I have almost completely degoogled my life all the way from ditching Gmail, YouTube and most of the services surrounding Google. And I must tell you, I feel so good. I haven't felt this way for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Anyways. Let's get to the meat of things.</strong></p>
<p>Before you continue you should read my post about <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">syncing to Dropbox</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to note, I am using Linux on my machine with Gnome desktop environment. This should work on MacOS too. To use this on Windows I suggest using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Subsystem for Linux</a> or <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h2>
<p>I liked structure from Dropbox. One folder where everything is located and synced. So, that's why adopted this also for my sync setup.</p>
<pre><code>~/Vault
   ↳ backup
   ↳ bin
   ↳ documents
   ↳ projects
</code></pre>
<p>All of my code is located in <code>~/Vault/projects</code> folder. And most of the projects are Git repositories. I do not use this sync method for backup per see but in case I reinstall my machine I can easily recreate all the important folder structure with one quick command. No external drives needed that can fail etc.</p>
<h2 id="sync-script">Sync script</h2>
<p>My sync script is located in <code>~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &lt; tilix.dconf
# 0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh

cd ~/Vault/backup/dotfiles

MACHINE=$(whoami)@$(hostname)
mkdir -p $MACHINE
cd $MACHINE

cp ~/.config/VSCodium/User/settings.json settings.json
cp ~/.s3cfg s3cfg
cp ~/.bash_extended bash_extended
cp ~/.ssh ssh -rf

codium --list-extensions &gt; vscode-extension.txt
dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &gt; tilix.dconf

cd ~/Vault
s3cmd sync --delete-removed --exclude 'node_modules/*' --exclude '.git/*' --exclude '.venv/*' ./ s3://bucket-name/backup/

echo `date +"%D %T"` &gt;&gt; ~/.vault.log

notify-send \
	-u normal \
	-i /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/96x96/status/security-medium-symbolic.symbolic.png \
	"Vault sync succeded at `date +"%D %T"`"
</code></pre>
<p>This script also backups some of the dotfiles I use and sends notification to Gnome notification center. It is a straightforward solution. Nothing special going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One obvious benefit of this is that I can omit syncing Node's <code>node_modules</code> or Python's <code>.venv</code> and <code>.git</code> folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use this script in a combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>When you start syncing your local stuff with a remote server you can review your items on DigitalOcean.</p>
<p><img src="https://mitjafelicijan.com/assets/dropbox-sync/dropbox-spaces.png" alt="Dropbox Spaces"></p>
<p>I have been using this script now for quite some time, and it's working flawlessly. I also uninstalled Dropbox and stopped using it completely.</p>
<p>All I need to do is write a Bash script that does the reverse and downloads from remote server to local folder. This could be another post.</p>

January 25, 2021 | https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine-may-be-a-caloric-restriction-mimetic/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine-may-be-a-caloric-restriction-mimetic/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Glucosamine emulates caloric restriction in rats due to mitohormesis.&nbsp;</p><div>
																
								
								
<p><a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine/">Glucosamine</a> is a polysaccharide that naturally occurs in cartilaginous joint tissues and is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. Glucosamine is also present in other tissues, such as skin, nails, bones, and ligaments. Synovial fluid contains glucosamine and occupies the space between joints, helping to reduce the friction of joint surfaces. Glucosamine is commonly taken as a supplement to help with the joint pain and inflammation associated with aging.</p>
<p><b>What does not kill us makes us stronger</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33478352/">study</a> we want to spotlight today shows how glucosamine produces a caloric restriction-like effect in rats. The researchers treated young rats and accelerated aging rats with regular doses of glucosamine, then they examined a number of aging biomarkers.</p>
<p>There was a significant rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both young and accelerated aging rats. ROS are reactive molecules and free radicals derived from oxygen, and while they do have some beneficial uses, such as being used by immune cells as a component of the killing response to combat microbial invasion, they are also very harmful to cells. Free radicals each possess an unpaired electron, making them highly reactive and thus able to damage all macromolecules, including lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>ROS is produced as a byproduct during the mitochondrial electron transport of aerobic respiration or by oxidoreductase enzymes and metal catalyzed oxidation. Mitochondria also produce increasing amounts of potentially harmful ROS as they become increasingly dysfunctional, and mitochondrial dysfunction is <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/topic/mitochondrial-dysfunction/">a hallmark of aging</a>.</p>
<p>It was originally thought that only phagocytic cells, which protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, produced ROS. This was shown to be incorrect, and more recent research shows that ROS has a role in cellular signaling, serving as both an intra- and intercellular messenger and influencing gene expression, apoptosis, and the activation of cellular signaling cascades.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that glucosamine spurs a transient increase in ROS, which, in turn, triggers a protective mitohormetic response. Mitohormesis describes a process in which low levels of mitochondrial ROS act as signaling molecules to trigger a cascade of cellular events that protect the cells from harmful effects. Essentially, the small amount of stress caused by the ROS encourages the cell to raise its shields.</p>
<p>They believe that this response produces an effect similar to the stress response observed in caloric restriction, and multiple biomarkers showed that this is the case. The old saying “What does not kill us makes us stronger” appears to apply here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aging is strongly correlated with several non-communicable disorders such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions. Glucosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, GlcN) is a naturally occurring amino sugar and is reported to act as a caloric restriction mimetic (CRM). In young and D-galactose-induced accelerated rat aging models, we tested a persistent oral dietary dose of GlcN and evaluated various aging biomarkers in erythrocytes and plasma. A significant increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in GlcN treated young and accelerated senescent rat model. Increased value of Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Potential (FRAP), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), and Plasma membrane reduced system (PMRS) was observed. We suggest that GlcN induces a mitohormetic impact by a transient increase in ROS. Our findings indicate that GlcN may be a successful CRM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>It should be noted that these results are in rats, but the idea that similar effects may occur in humans taking glucosamine is not beyond the realm of possibility. Caloric restriction increases lifespan in multiple species, so finding a way to emulate this effect without the need to engage in caloric restriction could have the potential to help people with metabolic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>It appears to be the case that glucosamine significantly reduces all-cause mortality in humans, according to not <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine-supplementation-reduces-all-cause-mortality/">one</a> but <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/human-study-links-glucosamine-and-chondroitin-to-reduced-mortality/">two</a> large-scale studies conducted last year. Glucosamine is cheap, readily available, and has compelling health and safety data behind it, and it would be a dietary supplement worth considering for <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/developing-a-science-based-personal-longevity-strategy/">a science-based personal longevity strategy</a>.</p>

        <p>Welcome back. This is the second post in my <em>Terrible Compiler for a Useless Language</em> series, in which I write about my attempt to implement a native Brainfuck compiler for x64 Linux. In this post, I'll be covering a basic parser for Brainfuck. Previous posts in the series:</p>

<p>Yes, how could you tell?</p>
<h2 id="i-got-the-acronym-joke-in-the-last-post-and-i-didn-t-like-it-it-s-in-poor-taste-personally-offends-me"><em>I got the acronym "joke" in the last post and I didn't like it. It's in poor taste/personally offends me.</em></h2>
<p>I don't like that joke either. Some kind of police force is necessary for society to function and we shouldn't say mean things about cops who aren't doing anything wrong (notice the lack of a comma before "who" here before you jump to conclusions). Worse yet, the acronym is <strong>badly spelled</strong>. But I <em>just couldn't resist</em>.</p>
<h2 id="get-to-the-point"><em>Get to the point</em>.</h2>
<p>But of course. Let's examine how Brainfuck works. What does Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">have to say</a> about it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the eight commands, then?</p>
<p><code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> respectively move the pointer backward and forward by one memory cell. As we've already mentioned at the very beginning, Brainfuck's memory cells are one byte in size and there's thirty thousand of them. These are our variables. Those of you, dear readers, coming from dynamically-typed languages like Python and JS, should be happy to hear that Brainfuck has no types.<br>
<code>-</code> and <code>+</code> decrement and increment the number in the memory cell at our pointer.<br>
<code>,</code> and <code>.</code> respectively get and put out one byte of data from/to the standard input/output.<br>
<code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are where things get <em>interesting</em> and Turing-complete - the former means "if the value at the pointer is 0, skip over to the instruction after the matching <code>]</code>". The latter means "if the value isn't zero, jump back to the instruction after the matching <code>[</code>". If this looks like a <code>while</code> loop to you, that's because it is one. Obviously, all square brackets must be paired up.</p>
<p>All other characters in a Brainfuck source file are considered comments and can be safely ignored. To work, then! Let's declare a new Cargo project with <code>cargo new bfc-rs</code>. Because we're trying to be slightly more professional this time, we won't stuff all the code in <code>main.rs</code>, we'll also create a <code>lib.rs</code> to hold the program's logic.</p>
<h2 id="defining-the-instructions">Defining the instructions</h2>
<p>Our first step should be to define a data type for Brainfuck commands:</p>
<pre><code><span>/// Type representing a standard Brainfuck instruction.
</span><span>#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(Debug, PartialEq)] </span><span>// this is for tests
</span><span>enum </span><span>BrainfuckInstr {
    </span><span>/// Move the data pointer back one cell.
</span><span>    PointerDec,
    </span><span>/// Move the data pointer forward one cell.
</span><span>    PointerInc,
    </span><span>/// Decrement the value of the current memory cell.
</span><span>    DataDec,
    </span><span>/// Increment the value of the current memory cell.
</span><span>    DataInc,
    </span><span>/// Get a byte from the standard input and store it in the current memory cell.
</span><span>    GetByte,
    </span><span>/// Write the current memory cell's value to the standard output.
</span><span>    PutByte,
    </span><span>/// Begin a while loop conditional on the current value not being zero.
</span><span>    WhileNonzero,
    </span><span>/// Close the while loop.
</span><span>    EndWhile
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's a secret. You'll find out two blogposts from now.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was easy. Now let's write a Brainfuck program that writes a newline to the standard output, because typing out a full Hello World would be a stupidly large amount of work:</p>
<pre><code><span>++++++++++ Add 10 to the current byte to make a newline or 0x0A byte
. Print it
</span></code></pre>
<p>I've saved it as <code>newline.bf</code> in our project's directory for later use. Now let's define a <code>Parser</code> struct, a <code>parse</code> function and write a test for it before we implement anything, because I think "Test-Driven Development" looks good on a resumé. From lib.rs:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[</span><span>cfg</span><span>(test)] </span><span>// only declare a "tests" module when the Rust compiler is in test mode
</span><span>mod </span><span>tests;

</span><span>/// The syntax errors possible.
</span><span>#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(Debug)]
</span><span>enum </span><span>SyntaxError {
    </span><span>/// A closing square bracket was found at the contained line:index position, but there was no opening square bracket before it.
</span><span>    PrematureEndWhile(</span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>usize</span><span>),
    </span><span>/// The last while loop opened, at the contained line:index position, has no closing bracket.
</span><span>    UnclosedWhile(</span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>usize</span><span>)
}
</span><span>/// Struct responsible for parsing Brainfuck.
</span><span>struct </span><span>Parser; </span><span>// empty because it has no internal state yet
</span><span>impl </span><span>Parser {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>code</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt;, SyntaxError&gt; {
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The contents of our <code>tests.rs</code> file will be as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>const </span><span>NEWLINE_PRINTING_PROGRAM</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str </span><span>= include_str!("</span><span>../newline.bf</span><span>"); </span><span>// same thing as we did with the NASM template while writing HWDPC
</span><span>use super</span><span>::*; </span><span>// import all symbols from our parent module, the library root
</span><span>use </span><span>BrainfuckInstr::*;
#[</span><span>test</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>test_newline_program</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let mut</span><span> parser = Parser;
    </span><span>let</span><span> output = parser
    .</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>NEWLINE_PRINTING_PROGRAM</span><span>)
    .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>The newline program contains no syntax errors, something is wrong with the parser.</span><span>");
    </span><span>let</span><span> expected_output: Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt; = vec![
        DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc,
        DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc,
        PutByte
    ];
    assert_eq!(&amp;output, &amp;expected_output)
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="writing-the-parser-logic">Writing the parser logic</h2>
<p>If we invoke <code>cargo test</code> right now, the test will unsurprisingly fail, because the <code>unimplemented!()</code> macro in <code>parse</code> makes the compiler think a value of the right type gets returned, but at runtime panics (=crashes) the thread it's running on, thus failing any test we put it in. Let's get to work actually implementing <code>parse</code>, then.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>code</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt;, SyntaxError&gt; {

        }

<p>Now, our tests pass, the whole one. This is too good, we need more tests.</p>
<h2 id="test-programs-meant-to-fail">Test programs meant to fail</h2>
<p>Let's write two faulty programs, <code>premature.bf</code> and <code>unmatched.bf</code>, and the corresponding tests.</p>

<p>The tests:</p>

<p>We haven't actually implemented any bracket-matching behavior, so the parser just keeps producing "valid" lists of instructions wrapped in the <code>Ok</code> variant of Rust's <code>Result</code>.

<p>How could we do this? Well, you see, early on in uni I had this one guy teach one of my courses. He was probably a better researcher than he was a teacher, as he was openly rude to his students and didn't really care to explain anything. His default answer to any question was "it's all in The Book", and his favorite joke was letting someone muddle their way through an exercise, nod along and encourage them, then, when they finished, proclaiming smugly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is all completely wrong. Go read the relevant chapter at home, class is over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it, he was kind of an asshole. Or maybe he was going through hard times, but that would mean I don't get to be self-righteous and talk smack about him.</p>
<h2 id="does-this-sob-story-emotionally-colored-digression-lead-anywhere"><em>Does this <del>sob story</del> emotionally-colored digression lead anywhere?</em></h2>

<p>
λProlog is a logic programming language based on an
intuitionistic fragment of
Church's <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/">Simple
Theory of Types</a>.  Such a strong logical foundation provides
λProlog with logically supported notions of modular
programming, abstract datatypes, higher-order programming, and the
lambda-tree syntax approach to the treatment of bound variables in
syntax.  Implementations of λProlog contain support for
simply typed λ-terms and (subsets) of higher-order
unification.
</p>

<p>
Although λProlog was originally designed and implemented in the
late 1980s, interest in the language contains new implementations and
new applications, particularly in the area of meta-programming.
</p>

<h2>Current implementations of λProlog</h2>
<ol>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/~gopalan/">Gopalan Nadathur</a> and
his team have developed
the <a href="http://teyjus.cs.umn.edu/">Teyjus</a> implementation of
λProlog.  Its compiler is written in OCaml, and it now supports
separate computation, effective uses of types at run-time, a
restriction of unification to the higher-order pattern fragment, etc.
The ALP Newsletter (March 2010) has an
<a href="http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/ALP/2010/03/teyjus-a-lprolog-implementation/">overview
article</a> about the Teyjus system.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sacerdot/">Claudio Sacerdoti Coen</a> and
<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Enrico.Tassi/">Enrico
Tassi</a> have lead a team that
developed <a href="https://github.com/LPCIC/elpi/">ELPI</a>: an
embeddable λProlog interpreter.  The interpreter is written in
OCaml and it is described in
a <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01176856/">paper</a> that appeared
LPAR 2015.  The Coq
plugin <a href="https://github.com/LPCIC/coq-elpi">Coq-ELPI</a> makes
it possible to execute λProlog programs in a Coq environment.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://astampoulis.github.io/">Antonis Stampoulis</a>
has implemented the 
<a href="http://astampoulis.github.io/makam/">Makam</a>
metalanguage which is a refinement of
λProlog.  Makam is implemented from scratch in OCaml. 
</li>
</ol>

<h2><img src="http://abella-prover.org/images/logo-small.png"> &nbsp;: a prover for λProlog programs</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://abella-prover.org/">Abella</a>
is an interactive theorem prover based on a number of new ways to
exploit inductive and coinductive reasoning with relations.
Abella is well-suited for reasoning about specification that
manipulate objects with binding since it contains the following three
logically motivated features:
</p><ol>
<li>direct support of λ-tree syntax (sometimes also called HOAS);</li>
<li>the ∇-quantifier; and</li>
<li>a built-in, <em>two-level logic approach</em> to reasoning about
computation.</li>
</ol>
In the latter feature, the <em>specification logic</em> is used to
specify computations: this logic is a subset of λProlog.
Abella's logic then serves as the <em>reasoning logic</em>.
Probably the most elegant formalization of 
the π-calculus and its meta-theory is the one written in Abella.
Principle contributors to the implementation of Abella are 
<a href="http://chaudhuri.info/">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a>,
<a href="http://loonwerks.com/people/andrew-gacek.html">Andrew
  Gacek</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wang-yuting/">Yuting Wang</a>.



<!--- 
<h2>Parinati: Compiling Twelf signatures into &lambda;Prolog</h2>

<p>The dependently typed &lambda;-calculus underlying Twelf can
be effectively translated into the logic underlying &lambda;Prolog in
such a way that Teyjus can then preform proof search for Twelf.
<a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/~snow/">Zach Snow</a> 
has written the
system <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~snow/parinati/">Parinati</a>
that implements this translation: as a result, Teyjus can be used to
implement proof search in Twelf signatures.
</p>
-->

<h2>Examples of code</h2>

<p>
Examples of λProlog code can be found various places: 
 in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/teyjus/">Teyjus distribution</a>;
 in an <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/proghol/extract.html">extraction</a> from the
 book <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/proghol/"><em>Programming 
        with Higher-Order Logic</em></a>; and in
 a <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/examples/code.html">small collection</a>.
 Since the ELPI implementation is written in OCaml and since OCaml can
 be compiled into JavaScript, it is possible to execute λProlog
 programs in a web browser: for an example, see the online 
<a href="https://trymlts.github.io/">MLTS</a> implementation.
</p>


<h2>The lprolog mailing list is closed</h2>

<p>A mailing list for λProlog, most recently maintained by
   Gopalan Nadathur, has been closed after operating for about 25
   years. 
</p>

<!--
 maintains the lprolog mailing list:

mainly intended for the discussion of papers and systems concerning
&lambda;Prolog and related systems, announcements of conferences and

Notable examples are <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a>, <a href="https://repast.github.io/index.html">Repast</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0037549705058073">MASON</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa">Mesa</a>.</p><p>Implementing an ABM framework in Julia has several advantages:</p><ol><li>Using a general purpose programming language instead of a custom scripting language, such as NetLogo's, removes a learning step and provides a single environment for building the models and analyzing their results.</li><li>Julia has a rich ecosystem for data analysis and visualization, implemented and maintained independently from Agents.jl.</li><li>Julia is easier-to-use than Java (used for Repast and MASON), and provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) environment to build and analyze models interactively.</li><li>Unlike Python (used for Mesa), Julia is fast to run.

It has a short learning curve, and allows one to extend its capabilities and express complicated modeling scenarios. Agents.jl was originally inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa">Mesa</a> framework for Python, but has since then departed in design, leading to a dramatically simpler and cleaner API, besides having obvious performance benefits (more than 30 times better performance than Mesa in some cases, see our <a href="https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/comparison/#Agents.jl-Performance-and-Complexity-Comparison">Agents.jl Performance and Complexity Comparison</a>).</p><h2 id="Crash-course-on-agent-based-modeling"><a href="#Crash-course-on-agent-based-modeling">Crash course on agent based modeling</a><a id="Crash-course-on-agent-based-modeling-1"></a><a href="#Crash-course-on-agent-based-modeling" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>An agent-based (or individual-based) model is a computational simulation of autonomous agents that react to their environment (including other agents) given a predefined set of rules [<a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.04.023">1</a>]. ABMs have been adopted and studied in a variety of research disciplines. One reason for their popularity is that they enable a relaxation of many simplifying assumptions usually made by mathematical models. Relaxing such assumptions of a "perfect world" can change a model's behavior [<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/460685a">2</a>].</p><p>Agent-based models are increasingly recognized as <em>the</em> approach for studying complex systems [<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-7908-1721-X_7">3</a>,<a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1162/106454602753694765">4</a>,<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/460685a">5</a>,<a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2016.01.009">6</a>]. Complex systems cannot be fully understood using traditional mathematical tools which aggregate the behavior of elements in a system. The behavior of a complex system depends on both the behavior of and interactions between its elements (agents). Small changes in the input to complex systems or the behavior of its agents can lead to large changes in outcome. That is to say, a complex system's behavior is nonlinear, and that it is not only the sum of the behavior of its elements. Use of ABMs have become feasible after the availability of computers and has been growing ever since, especially in modeling biological and economical systems, and has extended to social studies and archaeology.</p><p>An ABM consists of autonomous agents that behave given a set of rules. A classic example of an ABM is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794">Schelling's segregation model</a>, which we implement as an example here. This model uses a regular grid and defines agents at random positions on the grid. Agents can be from different social groups. Agents are happy/unhappy based on the fraction of their neighbors that belong to the same group as they are. If they are unhappy, they keep moving to new locations until they are happy. Schelling's model shows that even small preferences of agents to have neighbors belonging to the same group (e.g. preferring that at least 30% of neighbors to be in the same group) could lead to total segregation of neighborhoods. This is an example of emergent behavior from simple interactions of agents that can only be captured in an agent-based model.</p><h2 id="Citation"><a href="#Citation">Citation</a><a id="Citation-1"></a><a href="#Citation" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>If you use this package in a publication, please cite the paper below:</p><blockquote><p>R.

                <p>While working on a new <a href="https://boxoutsports.com/">Box Out</a> feature, I needed to query for graphics that have been shared on social media. </p><p>I had a <code>graphics</code> table with a <code>tweet_id</code> column. I wanted to query for graphics that have been shared on twitter (aka <code>tweet_id IS NOT NULL</code>). &nbsp;</p><p>The table is in the hundreds of thousands of rows, so I wanted to index <code>tweet_id</code> to help the query along. I was going to a plain old <code>add_index</code>. But then I remembered that you can do partial indexes.</p><p>I knew that this was <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/indexes-partial.html">possible with Postgres</a>. And I've used partial indexes in the past. What I didn't know is that you do this through Rails migrations without dropping down to <code>execute</code> and vanilla SQL (not that there is anything inheritantly bad about SQL).</p><h2 id="where">where</h2><p>A few googles later I learned that Rails actually has support built in. The <code>where</code> key allows you to define a partial index.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>add_index :graphics, :tweet_id, 
  where: "tweet_id IS NOT NULL", 
  algorithm: :concurrently
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Slick! This means only <code>graphics</code> with a <code>tweet_id</code> will go into the index. Just a minor space savor for me, but could be a big deal for you and one of your tables.</p><h2 id="aglorithm-concurrently">aglorithm: :concurrently</h2><p>If you haven't seen <code>aglorithm: :concurrently</code>, it allows you to avoid downtime by indexing the column in the background. </p><p>It takes a bit longer to complete and can slow things down a bit (which makes sense, as extra work is happening). But it means your app can be up and available while adding the index. No locks or downtime. </p><h2 id="strong_migrations">strong_migrations</h2><p>Lastly, while I'm on the topic of migrations, one of my favorite gems is <a href="https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations">strong_migrations</a>. It automatically catches migrations that could cause problems in production while you are still in development and lets you know. Usually, it provides you with the steps to get to where you want to be as well. </p><p>For example, on this migration I initially forgot to use the <code>algorithm: :concurrently</code>. As soon as I tried to <code>bin/rails db:migrate</code>, strong_migrations complained quite loudly at me by raising an error. I updated the migration and then it ran smoothly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Last year I published my first book with a publisher, <a href="https://handsonbughunting.com/"><em>Hands on Bug Hunting For Penetration Testers</em></a>.</p>

<p>Going in, I was determined to set up a workflow that would allow me to:</p>

<p>1) Keep a backup of the book.<br>
2) Allow me to easily track my writing progress.<br>
3) Work on the book offline.<br>
4) Keep my own copy of the book.</p>

<p>What set of tools could possibly control the versioning, backup, access control, and portability of plain text?</p>

<p>I had all the tools in front of me - and had already started using them. I could use a git repo to keep a backup of the book and track changes, using Unix tools like <code>wc</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>ag</code> (basically a faster <code>grep</code>) and others to accomplish everything I needed to - in a workflow I was already comfortable with.</p>

<p>It was tooling kismet.</p>

<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>

<p>Here’s how the book repo is laid out.</p>

<pre><code>book/
    code/
    docs/
    manuscript/
    promotions/
    cover.jpg
    outline.md
    review-notes.md
    technical-instructions.md
</code></pre>

<p>The directories should be pretty self-explanatory and, as you can tell, deal with more than just the immediate manuscript. <code>promotions</code> lets me keep track of guest blog ideas, content strategy campaigns, and tactics I’m coordinating together with my publisher’s marketing team. <code>code</code> is all my code (surprise!) Although I haven’t found it necessary yet to program a solution for inlining the code snippets, yet (I just copy them over), it could definitely be done.
<code>docs</code> is for research I’m compiling in the course of writing the book, so I can ensure everything is properly cited, and I can pull in the original document for my publisher to inspect if they want to know the source of an idea, statistic, graph, or other quoted resource.</p>

<p>The files are also pretty direct. <code>outline.md</code> is an outline, <code>review-notes.md</code> is a file where I keep <em>my</em> notes on <em>my publishers</em> notes, thinking in text about how to shape the book using their suggested edits. <code>technical-instructions.md</code> is where I’ve kept any extra-textual instructions on setup and troubleshooting, for the technical editor to review, and the <code>cover.jpg</code> is, well, the cover.</p>

<h2 id="the-manuscript">The Manuscript</h2>

<p>But let’s take a deeper dive into the meatiest part of this setup - the actual <code>manuscript</code>.</p>

<pre><code>book/
    code/
    docs/
    manuscript/
        Preface.txt
        Assessment.txt
        Ch1_Introduction.txt
        Ch2_Choosing_Your_Hunting_Ground.txt
        Ch3_Preparing_for_an_Engagement.txt
        Ch4_Unsanitized_Data_A_Case_Study_in_XSS.txt
        Ch5_SQLi_Code_Injection_and_Scanners.txt
        Ch6_CSRF_and_Insecure_Session_Authentication.txt
        Ch7_XML_External_Entities_XXE.txt
        Ch8_Access_Control_and_Security_through_Obscurity.txt
        Ch9_Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Social_Engineering.txt
        Ch10_Framework_and_Application-Specific_Vulnerabilities.txt
        Ch11_Formatting_your_Report.txt
        Ch12_Other_Tools.txt
        Ch13_Other_(Out-of-Scope)_Vulnerabilities.txt
        Ch14_Going_Further.txt
        images/
    promotions/
    cover.jpg
    outline.md
    review-notes.md
    technical-instructions.md
</code></pre>

<p>Flat is better than nested, always. Rather than have chapter directories and possibly keeping images together, I went this route so that I could keep this nice at-a-glance view.</p>

<p>You might be noticing though - why use the <code>txt</code> file extension here but not in other files like <code>review-notes.md</code>, where I use the <code>md</code>? That’s because of a simple wrapper I wrote out around <code>wc</code>. I call it <code>txt</code> and keep it symlinked as a command under <code>/usr/local/bin/txt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

total=0

for FILE in `find . -type f -name "*.txt"`

do
    wc -w $FILE
    words=`wc -w &lt; $FILE | tr -d ' '`
    total=$(($total + $words))
done

printf "%'d" $total

echo " words
</code></pre>

<p>All this does is add the word count returned by <code>wc</code> and show the total word count of all the <code>.txt</code> files under the path where the command is called, with a file-by-file breakdown As you can see, it only targets <code>.txt</code> files, so using that convention we can keep <code>.md</code> out of the count.</p>

<p>How about <code>images</code>? For that directory I try to use its own naming convention:</p>

<pre><code>arachni-cli-sqli.png                      
arachni-help.png                          
arachni-html-report.png                   
arachni-sqli-timing-attack-part-two.png   
arachni-sqli-timing-attack.png
</code></pre>

<p>There’s no formal convention of chapter-topic-modifier (next time!) but even just grouping common images under compatible topic buckets everything together in an alphabetically-sorted view, and makes it easier to navigate. And because the <code>images</code> are in the <code>manuscript</code> directory, right alongside the individual chapters, referencing an image in a chapter looks like:</p>

<pre><code>![alt image text](/images/some-image-path.png)
</code></pre>

<p>Coincidentally (or not) the layout of my Hugo blog allows me to use this exact syntax and path reference.</p>



<p>So what do I use to take advantage of this all-markdown, all-the-time workflow? A few things</p>

<h3 id="sublime-text-markdownediting-markdownpreview">Sublime Text + MarkdownEditing + MarkdownPreview</h3>

<p>Sublime Text has a couple of great plugins for working with Markdown. Together, these two plugins give you syntax highlighting, a better background / text theme, centers the text, and allows you to use a shortcut to preview the document in your browser.</p>

<h3 id="bat">Bat</h3>

<p>Do you use <code>bat</code>? You should. A “cat clone with wings,” it provides beautiful syntax highlighting, <code>less</code>, and a bunch of other goodies, while also acting as a direct drop-in for <code>cat</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2ea95c30ed625376e3f345df019f4bdf0079a71e/c94a8/images/bat-highlighting.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="ag">Ag</h3>

<p><code>ag</code> is just a faster <code>grep</code>, basically - and having access to quick, easy, full-text search functionality is key. Being able to easily answer questions like “When have a previously referenced OWASP?” in order to avoid repeating myself, or get a quick refresher on how much background I’d given or what I’d already covered, is great.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/841bd5a3f8e3cc92f6ae3526c4271515d888f781/dd196/images/ag-example.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>I paid for the <a href="https://writeapp.co/">Write app</a> a few years ago to try it out, and though I’ve moved on to Sublime Text, I keep it for it’s greate translation ability. Using it I can convert a markdown file to a <code>pdf</code>, <code>doc</code>, <code>rtf</code>, or other common format.</p>

<h3 id="anything-really">Anything, Really</h3>

<p>There’s so much more I could incorporate into the workflow that I haven’t already. Maybe I could set it up so that if I didn’t push a commit of a certain size in a certain period to Github, I’d get a Slack reminder - or use my plain text corpus to create a NN that would try to autocomplete my writing in my own voice. The sky’s the limit! Using the plain-text, markdown-first approach opens up the possible ecosystem to include pretty much anything in the Unix mold.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>Using this workflow I get all the advantages a programmer does with code - a robust version history, a repo back up system (through strategic use of <code>remotes</code>), easy collaboration (add your editor as a github collaborator), and I don’t get locked into any proprietary formats, or rely on some third-party online editor where I fundamentally don’t control what I’m writing.</p>

<p>And I get the portability of markdown! Though my publisher, Packt, requires you to use an online CMS to write books with them, it lacks some of the tooling I need (and has the always-online problem). But because it also uses / supports markdown through a combination markdown/WYSIWYG system, all I have to do is copy and paste each chapter in as I finish it.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>

<p>The beauty of this system is that you can transpose it onto just about anything. If you write a blog using a static site generator (like I am), then you’re probably already formatting your posts as markdown files under a <code>posts</code> or similar folder.</p>

<p>When all long-form writing projects (documentation, books, blog posts) can use the same system, you get a beautiful convergence of tools that lets you <em>just write</em>, without getting hung up on which particular solution (Word, Google Docs, flat file) fits what particular content.</p>

        <h2 itemprop="headline">Names to avoid in Software Engineering</h2>
        <p itemprop="about"><i>An incomplete list of poor names for libraries, modules, projects and teams</i></p>
        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2021-01-24</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>There's an old joke that says the two hardest problems in Computer Science are
cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-one errors. Now, giving good names
is as much an art as a science, and there are many different schools of advice.
When it comes to variable and function naming, <a href="https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html">Rob Pike's notes on C
Style</a> capture the essential goals
of good naming practice. However, the Tao of Naming is going to be a contentious
topic, and I have no interest in opening that can of worms today.</p>

<p>Names that stink, however, are much easier to spot. Here is an incomplete list
of names that should give you pause if you ever encounter them in the wild. Some
of these bad names you can fix with just a simple commit. Some of these names
indicate a much deeper problem, that will require you to investigate whether the
object that bears that name should actually exist as one object at all, or if it
must be refactored or reorg into different units.</p>

<h2>File under M for Misc</h2>

<p>Most programming languages offer developers a way to group collections of
similar functions and types into software packages or modules. For some
programmers, the ability to have a place to put code that's shared in one place
is all that they want from this feature, and they approach code organization
with the same amount of thought as their second-from-the-bottom kitchen drawer.</p>

<p>This is why you end up with software modules with names like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>utils</code></li>
<li><code>lib</code></li>
<li><code>tools</code></li>
<li><code>misc</code></li>
<li><code>etc</code></li>
<li><code>common</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever I see <code>common</code>, I'm very tempted to commit additional packages named
<code>rare</code>, <code>epic</code> and <code>legendary</code>, and have the contents of each of them be just:</p>

<pre><code># You must reach a higher level to use this code
</code></pre>

<p>There's nothing wrong with putting code in a misc place <em>temporarily</em>, while you
work on it. But when you find that the code is already being reused by different
components in your project, it's time to put a little effort into categorizing
what those <code>tools</code> you're stuffing into the drawer are, so that other developers
know to look in there when they need it.</p>

<h2>The ThingDoer is a thing that does something</h2>

<p>When developers adopt design patterns they picked up from textbooks, college
classes or blogs, we can sometimes forget to make the name relevant to the
codebase or task at hand. Perhaps the developers put in a little more
abstraction than they should have into the code. Or, there might be a class that
could just have been a function or a for-loop. This is where we run into the
category of <code>ThingDoer</code> names, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Executor</code></li>
<li><code>Manager</code></li>
<li><code>Visitor</code></li>
<li><code>Transformer</code></li>
<li><code>Factory</code></li>
<li><code>SyncService</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Such names might be appropriate for superclasses and interfaces but are not
great matches for business logic. If these classes genuinely need to exist, at
least consider including more context about what ThingDoer does, or how it does
it, in the name.</p>

<h2>Watch out, I'm using Computer Science!</h2>

<p>My conjecture is that developers with an academic background are susceptible to
the trap of naming classes after concepts in computer science. Classwork focuses
on teaching core abstract data types, without introducing any real-world
embellishments. However, in real-world situations the fact that your
<code>LibraryBook</code>s are a <code>Node</code> in a <code>Graph</code> is often less important than the fact
that they are <code>LibraryBook</code>s.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-Data</code></li>
<li><code>-Info</code></li>
<li><code>Entity</code></li>
<li><code>Set</code></li>
<li><code>Node</code></li>
<li><code>Graph</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is data. I haven't thought through whether I agree with that
statement philosophically. However, when you're programming, <em>everything is data</em>.
Therefore, adding the word <code>Data</code> or <code>Info</code> at the end of a class or variable
name is free of any semantic content.</p>

<p>Similarly, any references between objects in your programs will form a graph, by
definition. Is there something specifically Graph-y about your class, so that
everyone needs to be reminded every time they type it? In the instance of a
purpose-built graph library, that is definitely the case. For the rest of us, we
can name our <code>PetNetworkGraph</code> simply <code>PetNetwork</code>, or even more tersely,
<code>Pets</code>.</p>

<h2>Coordination problems</h2>

<p>Communication and coordination is one of the hardest parts of getting a single
group to do something new, and that is especially true for engineering. This
effect compounds drastically as the number of groups involved grows. The next
names are not specifically bad names, but signify projects that should be
treated with care.</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Voltron</li>
<li>Megazord</li>
<li>Any musical supergroup</li>
<li>Any project named after an Anime mecha that combines into a bigger mecha</li>
</ul>

<p>These names are usually attached to an effort requiring multiple (more than two)
separate teams to coordinate in some deep way. Perhaps the goal is to bring each
of several teams on legacy platforms onto the new standard software. Or maybe
these teams now all need to share data, and build pair-wise data integrations
between all of them. You can probably think of a few examples yourself.</p>

<p>Just like the Power Rangers, this project can succeed if it is run with
teamwork, strong leadership and technical maturity. Nevertheless be on your
guard when you see a Project Voltron.</p>

<h2>This team has an unspecified goal</h2>

<p>The final category I want to touch on today is something that I don't yet fully
understand myself. Engineering organizations of a sufficient size naturally
break into sub-teams that are tasked with specific business functions.
Sometimes, among them, we find a team who is meant to be "closest to the code",
the "most technical of them all". They are responsible for a grab bag of things,
such as developer experience, code standards, performance and libraries. And
they are usually called something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Platform team</li>
<li>Core team</li>
<li>Core Platform Team (true story)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't quite know what to make of this team. I've worked on a few Platform
teams myself, and my experience there has generally been very pleasant.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://danverbraganza.com/writings/the-phoenix-project">The Phoenix Project</a>, changed my
thinking around how engineering teams deliver value. Rather than committing to
large pre-planned projects, it is better to deliver value in small increments.
No value has been created until something is in the hands of a customer, and
so-called Work in Progress represents a large liability on the sheets of the
business.</p>

<p>Based on this, I've now grown skeptical of whether confining engineering talent
to work on "the Platform" without specific business objectives is wise.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don't Call Yourself a
Programmer</a>, Patrick McKenzie quotes Peter Drucker on the difference between Profit
Centres and Cost Centres. In every business, some parts of the organization
directly make the money, and the rest of the business spends money, supporting
them. Patrick admonishes professionals to be attached to the former rather than
the latter.</p>

<p>I am concerned that Platform Teams generally read as cost centers to outsiders.
Even if the Platform Team delivers a piece of technology that is critical for a
product launch, the product team is the one getting the shout-out at all hands.
This is why I am tentatively adding Core Platform Team as another name to
avoid.</p>

Today it's well-suited to people with a side project, that's fine, it doesn't need to address a large market on day one.

The leap of faith we need to make is that there will be an Etsy or Shopify movement and that you can dramatically grow the market for people wanting to build a full-time business out of their side hustle and that some of these businesses will grow large (but that some percentage won't outgrow and leave the platform).

I don't think you're on the path to building full-on enterprise software, nor do I think you should be, but it means that there need to be significantly more small pure software products that want to transform into a small business. This is totally possible but I don't have conviction around that market today."</p><h3 data-id="7b0d8c1b4a96453f8c8615d6d5a9c5d3"><a href="#7b0d8c1b4a96453f8c8615d6d5a9c5d3" title="Index Ventures"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a></h3><p>"You're in a great area code but you need to be headed towards a specific address."</p><h3 data-id="b66e0bb209ef418bb79e365b2671758e"><a href="#b66e0bb209ef418bb79e365b2671758e" title="Earnest Capital"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://earnestcapital.com/">Earnest Capital</a></h3><p>"Your target customers may be bootstrappers, but what Saasify's trying to do as a platform is much larger and therefore a better fit for traditional VC."</p><h3 data-id="7bc741ab42754f6eaaec3c38e75a7857"><a href="#7bc741ab42754f6eaaec3c38e75a7857" title="SaaS Group"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://saas.group/">SaaS Group</a></h3><p>"Saasify is not worth much if it doesn’t have paying customers.

But what early stage VCs really care about is the size of your initial target market, since trying to build a solution that would apply to all of SaaS is pretty vague and difficult to imagine how you'd get there. </p><p>Stripe is a great example of an index company which fundamentally enables a significant chunk of online payments and SaaS. Saasify, on the other hand, provides a go-to-market solution for developer-oriented SaaS APIs.</p><p>It's pretty difficult for me to imagine Saasify's path to $100M revenue, which is the VC litmus test for whether or not an idea is worth their time. There are definitely some new-age VCs like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://earnestcapital.com/">Earnest Capital</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indie.vc/">Indie VC</a> that are looking to change this mindset by focusing on profitability over growth, but ultimately my goal with Saasify was more aligned with the traditional VC model of building a high-growth, high-impact company to solve a problem at scale.</p><p>The core problem I had set out to solve with Saasify was helping developers go independent.</p><p>And after several pivots, I ended up with a solution that didn't really solve the original problem that I cared about. It definitely had some early signs of traction, but no real signs of revenue traction or growth potential due to the quality of Micro SaaS products that we attracted.</p><div><p><span role="img" aria-label="⭐">⭐</span></p><p><b><em>I'm currently working to transition Saasify to a more open, community-led platform.</em></b>

<p>UPDATE: Since this blew up 1. I wrote this mostly in response <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon">this article in Bloomberg</a>. 2. If you want to follow me on Twitter for more hot takes on internet culture and marketing stuff you can do that here: <a href="https://twitter.com/JeromySonne">@jeromysonne</a></p>



<p>I want to preface all of this by saying I am not an investing expert. I currently hold no publicly traded companies’ stock. (Though I might I haven’t logged into Robinhood in a while). What I am pretty good at though is internet culture and understanding communities through that lens. I also don’t agree with the Wallstreetbets culture. I’m just trying to explain it.</p>



<p>The recent dramatic fall and meteoric rise of Gamestop via the short squeeze that happened has a lot of technical reasons that people a lot better at finance can explain. What keeps coming up though is Wallstreetbets and their hand in taking a stock that seemed doomed to failure and rocketing it to new heights. I’m seeing a lot of well-meaning takes on their role that generally miss the “why” of the community and what it does / how it exists. After reading a well-written article in Bloomberg (that ultimately misses the point on WSB). I thought I would take a moment to give some insights.</p>



<p>References to tendies, autism, gay bears, and a bunch of other things don’t really make a lot of sense on the surface (and some make even less sense once you dive in). The culture of Wallstreetbets is an interesting one, to say the least, that has a lot of its language and customs rooted in 4chan. As 4chan users have grown up, migrated to other corners of the internet, and spread their language it’s continued on and evolved in different spaces. You saw a lot of this with the_donald on Reddit a few years ago before it was banned and a lot of similar overlap in language between what the community was and what WSB is now. (Twitter is so late to the party compared to Reddit).</p>



<p>The basic surface-level story of WSB is this. It’s a bunch of autistic losers that live in their mom’s basement who are gambling what little money they have to try and become rich to live lifestyles of hedonism. Since they are basement dwellers their obvious food of choice is chicken tenders aka tendies that they trade in their GBPs (Good boy points) to their mom so they can get more. In this world, they earn good boy points by doing well at stocks.</p>



<p>On the surface, it seems really weird but it’s mostly a type of gallows humor that permeates a lot of especially young millennials and zennial men. That nothing really means anything, that no one cares about them (or in some cases actively hate them), and so they reject buying in on the society they feel actively scorns them. I’ll resist the urge to add my personal opinions or quote Fight Club here, but I’m mostly saying all this to get you in their head.</p>



<p>As someone that deals with some (in the grand scheme of things minor) mental health issues around panic attacks and anxiety attacks the “Fuck it if nothing means anything I may as well do what I want” attitude on a self-destructive and nihilistic level makes sense to me. It’s not logical but it makes sense. If nothing means anything you may as well do what you want and try and have some fun before the existential crisis of death takes us all. To do that though you need cash, and most of us are slammed with student debt, increased COL, and stagnant wages as compared to our parents’ generation. All the “boomer” advice we’re given doesn’t really make sense especially when it comes to the dreaded value investing that we’re told to do when it comes to stocks especially in light of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>



<p>See back in the day if you played the rules, worked the job, saved the money you could mostly live a pretty good life. The system was there and it had your back you just had to play by the rules. At some point that changed. Understanding that fundamentally you can do “everything right” and be totally fucked anyways, never able to achieve your dreams regardless of what you do or don’t do is a shitty feeling. Along comes WSB.</p>



<p>Suddenly, there’s a chance. Not a big one, but a chance to get out of your situation and live the life you want. You can do everything right and never be able to retire anyway, OR you can take super speculative positions in the stock market by making giant bets on risky options that, if you happen to be right, could make you rich. You’ve broken the cycle and you can live the life you want. Worst case? You’re right back where you started.</p>



<p>““<strong>If you owe</strong>&nbsp;your bank a hundred pounds,&nbsp;<strong>you have a problem</strong>. But&nbsp;<strong>if you owe</strong>&nbsp;a million,&nbsp;<strong>it</strong>&nbsp;has.” – Big Daddy Keyne$</p>



<p>I think there are really 2 things you need to understand about WSB (And really this piece of internet culture in general). It’s 50% depression and 50% a Molotov cocktail. You either win and get out or you lose AND you’re sticking it to the man at the same time. Even if I go super long, ratchet up the leverage, and take a big bet and lose guess what?</p>



<p>Nothing.</p>



<p>Seriously nothing. Most of these people are in hopeless debt with no clear path out anyway. They declare bankruptcy and move on. They took the bet, rode the adrenaline rush, and they lost. The silver lining? The elites that hate them are stuck paying the bill. It’s really a win-win situation. The memes, the culture, all of it really stems from this attitude.</p>



<p>I think it’s honestly fascinating that people are finally starting to notice this sub-culture once it’s begun affecting the mainstream financial system. Maybe now that it’s hitting these folks where they live, hurting the only thing they care about, they’ll start thinking about why these people are acting out. Before anyone accuses me of being a socialist I have a startup that sells <a href="https://decibelads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radio ads called Decibel</a>. I’m a died in the wool capitalist and I can plainly see these issues. That maybe if they felt they had more of a stake in the future, that wealth inequality wasn’t so bad, that they’ll never afford a home, etc. they wouldn’t feel the need to act out. That if they weren’t in such an unwinnable situation they wouldn’t feel the need to throw Molotov cocktails through the front window of the country and the global financial system.</p>



<p>I doubt it, but one can hope.</p>



<p>Until then this is going to get worse, not better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p><span>Retro computing platforms all feature some form of a keyboard. In the very early days of home computing, the keyboard differentiated the computers from each other. Later, as applications became more sophisticated, the mouse became the next significant input device to catch-on. Early 8-bit machines from Atari, Commodore, and even Apple all had a mouse interface. However, like other peripherals at the time, they were not compatible with each other. Today's retro computer enthusiast may have a hard time finding a functional mouse for their favorite platform. Sold by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RetrohaxN" rel="nofollow">Retrohax</a><span>, the </span><a href="https://retrohax.net/the-mouster-project-is-here/" rel="nofollow">mouSTer is a universal modern USB-to-retro mouse adapter</a><span>.</span></p><blockquote>"It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible."</blockquote><p>Early mice usually featured a DB9-interface, but that interface was not always compatible across platforms. A mouse designed for an Atari Falcon may not work on the Commodore 64. The mouSTer handles those translations. Additionally, it serves as the USB HID host needed to enable a modern mouse. Before mouSTer, retro-mouse adapters tended to favor the older PS/2-style mice. Few mice sold today still have that legacy protocol.</p><p>Retrohax says that nearly every modern mouse they've tested works with the adapter. Advanced features like RGB LEDs could technically be supported, but there is doubt that the retro computers supply enough current for those modern features. In terms of another limitation, there is not support for PC serial mice. Computers like a Commodore 64 expect a pair of analog signals from the mouse. Serial mice on the PC were RS-232 / digital devices.</p><figure></figure><p>MouSTer firmware updates happen via a USB flash drive. A couple of files on the drive allow mouSTer to reflash or reconfigure itself. Today mouse emulation modes default to Amiga, Atari ST, and game pad. The expectation is the adapter should work with Amiga 3000, the Atari XL/XE series, and the Commodore C64 and C128.</p><p><span>Getting a case for mouSTer has been an issue. Injection molding is not an option because it would cause the USB-connector to become filled with plastic. Retrohax has plans to release STL files so that users can 3d print a case. The first batch of 220 units is for sale on the </span><a href="https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/mouster/" rel="nofollow">Retrohax web store</a><span>, with a plan to produce another batch based on demand. Currently, the price is 116 PLN Polish Zloty, which is about 31 USD.</span></p></div></section></div>]]>

            <div><p><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The report, adopted on Wednesday with 364 votes in favour, 274 against, 52 abstentions, calls for an EU legal framework on AI with definitions and ethical principles, including its military use. It also calls on the EU and its member states to ensure AI and related technologies are human-centred (i.e. intended for the service of humanity and the common good).</p>

<p><strong>Military use and human oversight</strong></p>

<p>MEPs stress that human dignity and human rights must be respected in all EU defence-related activities. AI-enabled systems must allow humans to exert meaningful control, so they can assume responsibility and accountability for their use.</p>
<p>The use of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) raises fundamental ethical and legal questions on human control, say MEPs, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2018-0341_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterating their call</a> for an EU strategy to prohibit them as well as a ban on so-called â€œkiller robotsâ€�. The decision to select a target and take lethal action using an autonomous weapon system must always be made by a human exercising meaningful control and judgement, in line with the principles of proportionality and necessity.</p>
<p>The text calls on the EU to take a leading role in creating and promoting a global framework governing the military use of AI, alongside the UN and the international community.</p>

<p><strong>AI in the public sector</strong></p>
<p>The increased use of AI systems in public services, especially healthcare and justice, should not replace human contact or lead to discrimination, MEPs assert. People should always be informed if they are subject to a decision based on AI and be given the option to appeal it.</p>
<p>When AI is used in matters of public health, (e.g. robot-assisted surgery, smart prostheses, predictive medicine), patientsâ€™ personal data must be protected and the principle of equal treatment upheld. While the use of AI technologies in the justice sector can help speed up proceedings and take more rational decisions, final court decisions must be taken by humans, be strictly verified by a person and be subject to due process.</p>

<p><strong>Mass surveillance and deepfakes </strong></p>
<p>MEPs also warn of threats to fundamental human rights and state sovereignty arising from the use of AI technologies in mass civil and military surveillance. They call for public authorities to be banned from using â€œhighly intrusive social scoring applicationsâ€� (for monitoring and rating citizens). The report also raises concerns over â€œdeepfake technologiesâ€� that have the potential to â€œdestabilise countries, spread disinformation and influence electionsâ€�. Creators should be obliged to label such material as â€œnot originalâ€� and more research should be done into technology to counter this phenomenon.</p>
<p><br><strong>Quote</strong></p>
<p>Rapporteur <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/124738/GILLES_LEBRETON/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilles Lebreton (ID, FR)</a> said: â€œFaced with the multiple challenges posed by the development of AI, we need legal responses. To prepare the Commissionâ€™s legislative proposal on this subject, this report aims to put in place a framework which essentially recalls that, in any area, especially in the military field and in those managed by the state such as justice and health, AI must always remain a tool used only to assist decision-making or help when taking action. It must never replace or relieve humans of their responsibilityâ€�.</p>

<p>The latest addition to the particle physics brick detector universe is a micro-scale model of the Large Hadron Collider, and its four main detectors, done by Nathan Readioff, a PhD student at the University of Liverpool.</p>
<p>Each detector model fits into the palm of your hand and yet features essentially all the main components of the experiment. &nbsp;The entire LHC is built from a total of 371 standard Lego pieces and each model can be put together in less than ten minutes, even by non-physicists 😉</p>
<p><img src="http://build-your-own-particle-detector.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MicroLHC_LatLon-24-28_Omni.png" alt="MicroLHC_LatLon+24-28_Omni" width="750px" data-old-src="https://build-your-own-particle-detector.org/wp-content/plugins/jquery-image-lazy-loading/images/grey.gif" data-original="http://build-your-own-particle-detector.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MicroLHC_LatLon-24-28_Omni.png"></p>
<p>Each model took Nathan around 40 hours to design, including the initial assembly in computer using Lego Digital Designer as well as several iterations with physics bricks. It was important to ensure that the models had a robust construction and could survive repeated handling, but sometimes the computer would glitch and allow parts to fit together in ways that would be impossible in real life.</p>
<p>The unique features of each detector meant that each model posed a fresh challenge. <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/">CMS</a> was by far the easiest to design since it is effectively a series of cylindrical layers – in fact the model virtually built itself. &nbsp;The <a href="http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/">ALICE</a> detector features a distinctive set of muon chambers although the dipole magnet coil next to them was far too complex to be accurately reproduced at this scale. &nbsp;The toroid magnet coils of <a href="http://atlas.ch/">ATLAS</a> were almost impossible to assemble but it turned out that stackable minifigure binoculars were the solution – even so it was a tight squeeze to add everything in.</p>
<p><a href="http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/">LHCb</a> was by far the most difficult of the four models, since it is completely different from the other detectors. &nbsp;Its characteristic magnet coils took over a month and around fifty different designs before the final one was found – this one small section is the part Nathan is most proud of.</p>
<h2>How about a real LEGO set!</h2>
<p>Nathan’s models finally reach the critical mass and got 10k supporter in the&nbsp;<a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/94885">Lego Ideas campaign</a>.<br>
Now it’s up to LEGO to make up their minds!! Thanks to of you supporting the project over the past few months!</p>
<h2>Get started with your micro LHC experiments</h2>
<p>If you simply cannot wait that long you can order the pieces e.g. via the Lego customer service or at Bricklink.<br>
Construction manuals along with a short description of each experiment as well as 3D model files can downloaded here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Developing a React app can be very productive and fun, but if you are used to working with Vue as I do, I bet you miss some of those great and useful features. One of those features is <code>Watchers</code>. In this blog post, we will try to find out how to improve the current React API and create a custom hook to help us "watch" for state changes.</p><h2>What are <code>Watchers</code> in React?</h2><p>Before we try to understand what <code>Watchers</code> are specific in a React app, we should try to understand what <code>Watchers</code> are in general. <code>Watchers</code> are simple functions that listen for changes on one or more pieces of state. <code>Watchers</code> are very helpful and usually used when there is a requirement to interact with a component that lives outside the React world (side effects).</p><p>In the next example, we will build a search component. We will listen for changes in the input's value, and based on that, we will send a request to the server.</p><h2>Using <code>useEffect</code> to watch for value changes</h2><p>The best start is to use the <code>useEffect</code> hook. It should help us listen for changes in the input value and trigger a request to the server based on these changes. Let's see how it goes:</p><pre><code>// SearchBox.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function SearchBox() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // Fetching logic...
  }, [ value ])

  return &lt;input
    value={value}
    onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)}
  /&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>This code should do the work, but two issues occur in the current implementation:</p><ol><li>It fetches the data on the first render of the component (This is how <code>useEffect</code> works).</li><li>It fetches the data on each keystroke of the user (multiple times for no reason).</li></ol><p>Let's try to resolve those issues.</p><h2>Using <code>useRef</code> to avoid first render fetching</h2><p>To avoid triggering fetch on the first render of the component, we can use a flag variable to determine if the current function call is the first. To do so, we will use the <code>useRef</code> hook. Let's see an example:</p><pre><code>// SearchBox.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

export default function SearchBox() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')
  const isFirstRender = useRef(true)

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (isFirstRender.current) {
      isFirstRender.current = false

      return
    }

    // Fetching logic...
  }, [ value ])

  return &lt;input
    value={value}
    onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)}
  /&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>This current code can do the job, but we can take it to the next step by wrapping the implementation into a custom hook.</p><h2>Create a custom hook: <code>useWatch</code></h2><p>By wrapping the <code>watcher</code> implementation into a custom hook, we will make the logic reusable and clean our component code.</p><pre><code>// useWatch.js
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

export default function useWatch( callback, deps ) {
  const isFirstRender = useRef(true)

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (isFirstRender.current) {
      isFirstRender.current = false

      return
    }

    callback();
  }, deps)
}
</code></pre><p>Here is the <code>SearchBox</code> component using the new hook we just created:</p><pre><code>// SearchBox.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import useWatch from '../hooks/useWatch'

export default function SearchBox() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  useWatch(() =&gt; {
    // Fetching logic...
  }, [ value ])

  return &lt;input
    value={value}
    onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)}
  /&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>In the next step, we will try to solve the second issue, when the fetching mechanism triggers every keystroke.</p><h2>Create a custom hook: <code>useDebouncedWatch</code></h2><p>To avoid multiple requests to the server, we could delay the fetching mechanism until the user stops typing. Then, and only then, we should trigger the function that fetches the data from the server.</p><pre><code>// useDebouncedWatch.js
import { useRef } from 'react'
import useWatch from './useWatch'

export default function useWatch( callback, deps, delay = 1000 ) {
  const timeoutHandler = useRef(null)

  useWatch(() =&gt; {
    if (timeoutHandler.current) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutHandler.current)
    }

    timeoutHandler.current = setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      callback();
    }, delay)
  }, deps)
}
</code></pre><p>This implementation waits 1000 milliseconds and only then calls the callback function (which will, in our case, fetch data from the server). If the value changes again before those 1000 milliseconds, the previous timer stops, and a new timer starts to count. This loop will go on and on until the user stops typing.</p><p>Here is the final code from our <code>SearchBox</code> component uses the new custom hook:</p><pre><code>// SearchBox.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import useDebouncedWatch from '../hooks/useDebouncedWatch'

export default function SearchBox() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  useDebouncedWatch(() =&gt; {
    // Fetching logic...
  }, [ value ])

  return &lt;input
    value={value}
    onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)}
  /&gt;
}
</code></pre><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As we can see, <code>Watchers</code> exists in the React world. We just had to peel the shell and expose it out. With only a few steps, we included this elegant API from Vue into React world.</p></div></div><div><p>Do you want to receive occasional mails about what‘s going on on this blog?

The algorithm, called Earthquake Transformer, leverages the now very popular Transformer neural network architecture widely used in processing seqeuntial data like speech and language. Analyzing seismic waves in some ways is quite similar to analyzing sound waves, and the algorithm, using Transformer's ability to learn to attend to important bits in the sequence to filter out noise, can precisely identify the start of microearthquakes from seismic waves.</p><blockquote><p>Understanding patterns in the accumulation of small tremors over decades or centuries could be key to minimizing surprises – and damage – when a larger quake strikes. [...] By improving our ability to detect and locate these very small earthquakes, we can get a clearer view of how earthquakes interact or spread out along the fault, how they get started, even how they stop,”</p></blockquote><h4><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akd4bg/this-app-claims-it-can-detect-trustworthiness-it-cant">This App Claims It Can Detect 'Trustworthiness.' It Can't</a></h4><p>DeepScore, a company based in Tokyo, offers an AI-based product to loan and health insurance companies that supposedly can determine a person's trustworthiness by simply observing one's facial features while answering a few questions like "Where do you live? How do you intend to use the money? Do you have a history of cancer?" The service is attractive in countries where traditional consumer information, like credit scores, are not available.</p><p>However, trying to determine a person's trustworthiness, or any non-visible features from videos of faces, raises major red flags. There is no "reliable science to indicate that [...] facial expressions or the inflections of [...] voice are proxies for [...] internal mental and emotional states." Such responses also vary greatly from person to person and culture to culture. There is also additional privacy concerns with the product, which could not operate in countries that have GDPR or GDPR-like regulations.</p><h3>Podcast</h3><p>Check out our weekly podcast covering these stories!&nbsp;<br><a href="https://aitalk.podbean.com/">Website</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://feed.podbean.com/aitalk/feed.xml">RSS</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lets-talk-ai/id1502782720">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/17HiNdxcoKJLLNibIAyUch">Spotify</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKARTq-t5SPMzwtft8FWwnA">YouTube</a></p><h3><strong>News</strong></h3><h4>Advances &amp; Business</h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2021/01/18/gametune-introducing-reinforcement-learning-for-optimizing-the-player-lifecycle/">GameTune: Introducing reinforcement learning for optimizing the player lifecycle</a>&nbsp;- "Across the board, we've found that developers have significant interest in using machine learning to fine-tune a game from a truly objective perspective.

<h6 id="h6183003">Update January 26. 2021: I received some feedback that people would be interested in more details of the reasons, why the React build process is so complicated, because, well, it is the title of this post. So, I added some more to the "Comparison and reasons" section and the "Conclusion"
    </h6>


    </div>
<p>Have you ever tried to share a freshly designed UI-component as a library? Recently, I was creating some <a href="https://gradientdescent.de/descent-ripple/">ripple-effect animations</a> in <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and decided to publish them in a library. It is neatly compiled with all the runtime, so it can be used without Svelte. To target the large audience of React developers, I also wrote a convenient <a href="https://gradientdescent.de/react-descent-ripple/">React wrapper component</a> for it. At first, I thought this would be an easy task, but the build process turned out to be harder than I thought. So, I want to share my experience. I will show a simpler example here, so let' go:
    </p>
<h2 id="h2549518">The project
    </h2>

<p>Let's assume, we want to share a simple component, which wraps Html content into a
    </p>
<p>Rocket     
      </p>
<p>The rocket is just a div, which has the borders styled in an unusual way with simple css. It is just a toy example, but I want to do this with React and Svelte, so let's start with the basic steps in Svelte:
    </p>
<h3 id="h3325710">Svelte
    </h3>

<p>To start, create a folder <code><code>svelte-div-rocket</code></code> and in it run
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm init</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and answer the questions to generate a package.json file. As <code><code>"main"</code></code> choose <code><code>"Rocket.svelte"</code></code> and then go ahead and create this file. For this example, I do not bother creating subfolders, for larger projects this would not be wise. Here is the content I put in the <code><code>"Rocket.svelte"</code></code>:
    </p>

<span><span>    </span><span>&lt;slot/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Let me explain: first, we have a comment bracket <code><code>&lt;!--... --&gt;</code></code> where the component is documented. Then there is the script, where we export a single prop <code><code>direction</code></code>. In the style element, we declare 4 CSS classes, one for each facing direction. And finally, the Html section has a div, where the class is picked based on the direction prop, and we got a slot so that we can add children into the rocket.
    </p>
<p>What else is to say about the component library? Not much, actually. We could add more information to the package.json, a README.md, and a license file, if we wanted to, or we could already publish this to npm. In a Svelte project, we can (after installation, obviously) use the component with
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>// Somecomponent.svelte</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    import Rocket  from 'svelte-div-rocket';</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rocket</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    some text</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Rocket</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>That's it for Svelte.
    </p>
<h3 id="h3616801">React
    </h3>

<p>Let's try the same process. Create a folder <code><code>react-div-rocket</code></code>, run <code><code>npm init</code></code>, answer questions with <code><code>"main":"Rocket.jsx"</code></code>, create this file and put this in:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>// Rocket.jsx</span></span>

<p>Also, create a file <code><code>rocket.css</code></code> where the 4 classes from the Svelte style tag are placed. When I try to use it from a project started with <code><code>create-react-app</code></code> the following error appears:
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>../react-div-rocket/rocket.jsx 8:8<br>
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (8:8)<br>
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">https://webpack.js.org</a>
    </p></div>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>It tells me, you can't have .jsx files in a library unless you have an extra webpack loader. The loader would have to be part of the app project, not the library, so it is no option to demand the users of our rocket library to install it. Instead, we have to transpile the jsx into plain js.
    </p>
<p>In this case, we could do this by hand or with the <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&amp;build=&amp;builtIns=false&amp;spec=false&amp;loose=false&amp;code_lz=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABACwKYBt1wBQEpEDeAUIogE6pQhlIA8AJjAG4B8AEhlogO5xnr0AhLQD0jVgG4iAXyJA&amp;debug=false&amp;forceAllTransforms=false&amp;shippedProposals=false&amp;circleciRepo=&amp;evaluate=false&amp;fileSize=false&amp;timeTravel=false&amp;sourceType=module&amp;lineWrap=true&amp;presets=react&amp;prettier=false&amp;targets=&amp;version=7.12.12&amp;externalPlugins=">Babel online transpiler</a>, since we just need to arrive here:

    </pre>
<p>In general, this is a tedious process, so let's start over and try a streamlined version.
First, delete the package.json. Then run
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npx create-react-library</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and answer all the questions. Depending on your computer and internet connection speed, you'll have time to grab some coffee. Small recap, the ready-to-use Svelte library has 2 files and uses <strong>~2 kB
    </strong> disk space, and has zero dependencies. To be fair, it does not have a test environment, an example app, or TypeScript linting and transpiling. The React folder has all that now. It takes about <strong>397 MB
    </strong> (<strong>420 MB
    </strong> with TypeScript template) of disk space and the node_modules folder has <strong>1087
    </strong> (<strong>1096
    </strong> with TypeScript) subfolders. It has no "normal" dependencies, but <strong>19
    </strong> dev-dependencies (<strong>29
    </strong> with TypeScript) and 1 peer-dependency (react).
    </p>
<p>It should be easy enough to adjust the template with our rocket component. Or is it not? Copy over the <code><code>Rocket.jsx</code></code> code to src/index.js, copy <code><code>rocket.css</code></code> into the src folder and build the library with the <code><code>npm run build</code></code> command. Then import the component into some app. And et voilà, nothing happens. Well, at least if the React version of the library and your project matches. If not, you get an error.
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>Quick fix: update both React versions or simply delete the React folder in the node_modules folder in our rocket library.
    </p></div>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>Assuming that there are no more errors, why are we not seeing any rockets? First, note that our CSS classes end up in <code><code>dist/index.css</code></code> but they are renamed during the build process. If we want to style something with our class 'uplookingrocket', we would need to write something like this:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>styles</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./rocket.css</span><span>'</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;p</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>={</span><span>styles</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>uplookingrocket</span><span>"</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Adjust our code accordingly aaaand..... still nothing. You can find the reason by looking into the <code><code>Example/App.js</code></code>. There is the following line:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>react-div-rocket/dist/index.css</span><span>'</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>That means, in the app, we have to import the component <strong>and
    </strong> the CSS file. Maybe that makes sense from a technical perspective since React/Webpack wants to bundle CSS into a single file, but from a user perspective, this is rather inconvenient. For our little project, it even questions, whether it makes sense at all. The "magic" happens in CSS, so we could only publish the CSS file in a library and let the user apply it to her Html elements.
    </p>
<h2 id="h295798">Comparison and reasons
    </h2>

<p>Both libraries work, at last. When you only look at the final results which are delivered to the consumer, <code><code>dist/index.js</code></code> and <code><code>dist/index.css</code></code> for React and <code><code>Rocket.svelte</code></code> for Svelte, there is no big difference in size and content. Why is the process to get there so different?<br>
React is much older than Svelte. It has a long history and along the way, it redefined itself and with it the way we look at web apps. The most popular way today is probably to create a bundled app with  <code><code>create-react-app</code></code>. It was not always clear that this would be the preferred operation mode by developers. It is also possible to run React completely from CDNs. This has the advantage that the React library is downloaded only once for all pages. This option explains why our library cannot contain jsx files: we can't know if the library is processed further or if it is directly called in the browser, and the browser does not understand jsx.
    </p>
<p>The Svelte developers on the other side could observe how the landscape of web development changed over time. Developers today transpile and bundle their apps anyway, so why not try to put the heavy lifting into the compile step? So, Svelte is a compiler. It does not have a heavy legacy backpack to carry around (yet?). It gathers all information when the final code is generated. Thus, we don't need to pre-process our library. Svelte condenses a lot that is good in React, but of course, it is much more. It has its own syntax and file type, it gets rid of the <code><code>virtual DOM</code></code> and instead <code><code>redefines reactivity</code></code>, and adds a lot of little helper gimmicks that make the life of a developer much easier.
    </p>
<p>Perhaps React shows the way, that Svelte might also go one day: Commit after commit new Ideas are added and more and more use-cases are covered. At the same time, the codebase grows, and complexity increases. Cutting back in features or supported …</p></div></div>

<p>When most people hear Apple in a sentence, their next thought is likely the color. This is because color has always played an exciting role in Apple’s history: from the original Mac to the iMac, from the G3 to the Cube, from Bondi Blue to Snow White. The introduction of color played a vital part in these products' success as it helped create strong visual brand recognition.</p>
<p>The prominent use of color no doubt stems from Steve Jobs obsessing over the smallest details. For instance, there was a time when Steve spent 30 minutes picking the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10">perfect shade of gray for the restroom signs</a>! and another time <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10#he-insisted-on-making-the-circuit-board-inside-the-mac-look-great-2">when he insisted on making the circuit board inside the Mac look great</a>. An engineer told him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only thing that matters is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs response was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For as long as we’ve had TVs, color has been an important metric to judge the display’s quality. We’ve witnessed technologies such as CRT, Plasma, and LCD compete to display the most life-like color. The newest technology to enter this fray is High Dynamic Range, aka HDR. The aim remains the same i.e. to recreate an image closer to that seen by the human eye. Traditionally, every video has been delivered in an 8-bit specification known as Rec. 709, displaying up to millions of shades of colors. HDR improves upon this by stepping up to 10 or 12-bit standard known as Rec. 2020 or BT.2020, representing 60 times more color combinations with smoother shade gradations aka “Billions of colors”.</p>
<p>Apple has generally been at the forefront of adopting the latest display technology. Some notable examples include - introducing high-resolution Retina Displays when 1366x768 was a very common resolution for Windows laptops, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-30-apple-imac-5k-el-capitan-billions-colors.html">Shipping 2015 Retina iMacs</a> with 10-bit displays i.e. “Billions of colors”, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">Apple TV 4K, which was one of the first consumer devices to support Dolby Vision HDR in 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">automatic upgrades of HD titles to Dolby Vision</a> for iTunes users - a move that is still unrivaled, iPhone 12 which is the first smartphone to be able to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/">record videos in the Dolby Vision HDR format</a>. Apple also sells <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">Pro Display XDR</a>, that costs upward of ~$5000 and ticks all the right boxes for any professional doing color-accurate work.</p>
<p>Therefore, with Apple’s color pedigree, it was surprising to see that on the M1 device specification page, there is <strong>no mention of whether M1 devices can output “Billions of colors”</strong>. In contrast, the Intel-based devices clearly outline this support.</p>

<p>Even the trusty method of viewing the value in <code>"About this mac" -&gt; "System Report" -&gt; "Graphics/Displays"</code> doesn’t show anything. Usually, this would list a value of 30-bit here (<em>i.e. 10-bit per RGB channel</em>). On M1 devices, the below is what you see when connected to an HDR capable display i.e. no mention of whether the M1 Mini is outputting a 10-bit video signal.</p>

<p><strong>So I set about testing 10-bit output support myself.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TV</strong> - 2017 Vizio M65-E0 (<a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/dd6cb89">Display Specifications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong> - Philips Brilliance P272P7VU 4K UHD 27" (<a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/8e9287b">Display Specifications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>2020 Mac Mini M1</strong> connected through a HDMI cable</li>
</ul>

<p>For this test, I used my trusty 2017 Vizio M65-E0 TV that has a 10-bit panel. I connected the Mac Mini to my Denon AVR-X1300 receiver. The “Displays” settings on Mac OS immediately gave me an option of enabling HDR.</p>

<p>At this point, it’s clear that the Mac Mini can output an HDR10 signal when connected to an HDR capable display. Next, I explored if it can output a 10-bit signal / Billions of colors to a non-HDR 10-bit display. This was done by connecting to the Philips Brilliance P272P7VU monitor.</p>
<h3 id="10-bit-psd-test">10-bit PSD test</h3>
<p>The first test was done by displaying a 10-bit PSD file in “Preview”, which supports 10-bit files. <strong>If the M1 outputs a 10-bit signal, then the gradients in the file would be smooth.</strong> Opening the file in “Preview” confirmed the 10-bit output as the test pattern was completely smooth. I also opened the same file in another image viewer called “Pixea” and observed banding which most likely is because “Pixea” doesn’t support 10-bit files. In the image below, the same file is open in “Preview” on the left and “Pixea” on the right.</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>You might not observe the difference between the two images below as during the upload and publishing this image might get converted to 8-bit. On my machine the left image is completely smooth while the right displays banding.</em></p>

After BDG purchased the site, the photographer discovered the article and sued them for infringement in Delaware, where BDG is incorporated.</p><p>In response, BDG moved to dismiss, arguing that it had merely bought, operated, and maintained the website itself (the asset, not the company that created the website), and therefore that it never committed a "volitional act" of copyright infringement.</p><p>The Court agreed. It held that <b>even though BDG owned the infringing content and operated and managed the site that shows it, there is no copyright infringement here</b>:</p><blockquote><b>Plaintiff has failed to allege that BDG committed a volitional act of copyright infringement.</b> The only volitional conduct alleged is that BDG acquired and thereafter managed Flavorwire, which hosts a 2011 article displaying Plaintiff’s copyrighted work. <b>Plaintiff has not alleged that BDG caused Flavorwire to display the copyrighted images</b>. To the extent Plaintiff argues that BDG should be liable for declining to take down the 2011 article after it acquired Flavorwire, . . . this omission is neither volitional conduct nor infringing conduct as contemplated by the Copyright Act.</blockquote><p>The Court then explained that the plaintiff <b>had</b> alleged "display" of the photos, but the problem was that owning the content and operating and managing the site that delivers it is <b>not enough</b> to show that the content is "displayed" as used in the copyright act:</p><blockquote>Plaintiff’s allegation that BDG “displayed” the copyrighted images appears based on a <b>broad definition of “display.”</b> Under the Copyright Act, “[t]o ‘display’ a work means to show a copy of it, either directly or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or process . . . .” 17 U.S.C. <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="35 U.S.C. § 101: Inventions patentable">§ 101</a>. T<b>he verb “display” can describe both the volitional act of making something visible (e.g., the Louvre displayed the Mona Lisa in 1797), as well as the passive maintenance of its visibility thereafter (e.g., the Mona Lisa has been displayed at the Louvre for many years). Plaintiff does not allege that BDG committed the initial act of display in 2011.</b> Thus, Plaintiff argues impliedly that BDG has infringed Plaintiff’s copyright by passively displaying the copyrighted images after acquiring Flavorwire.</blockquote><blockquote>. . .</blockquote><blockquote>Because BDG’s <b>only alleged volitional act was acquiring a website that hosted allegedly infringing copies of Plaintiff’s work</b>, Plaintiff has not stated a claim of direct copyright infringement. Thus, Plaintiff’s claim will be dismissed.</blockquote><p>The Court noted that many courts have rejected copyright liability against internet service providers who only "passively host" infringing content. It also rejected the idea that BDG had "distributed" the photos for the same reason.</p><h2>Can This Be Right?</h2><p>I haven't reviewed the precedent cited closely, but I did read the briefing. And one thing that jumps out as missing from the briefing is any discussion of how a web site actually works.</p><p>A web site is not like a copy of newspaper that sits on a shelf. A web site is more like a printing press that <b>prints</b> newspapers, and it only works if you turn it on, let it run, and provide paper. Or, in the case of a website—in the barest terms—it only works if you start the web server up, let it run, and provide electricity and network connectivity. When users request copies of the site, the server sends them.</p><p>Here, in my view, what BDG was doing was operating a server (or paying someone else to operate a server) that sends a copy of whatever is on the server to whoever asks for it. If BDG stops operating the server, the copying stops. BDG is not a common carrier like an ISP or hosting provider; the content is owned by BDG, and BDG's goal is to profit from that content through advertising or otherwise.</p><p>Thus, there is absolutely an affirmative act in both operating and maintaining the server. It's akin to buying a vending machine that prints copies of a book in exchange for money, and then feeding supplies into the machine, repairing it when it breaks, and taking the money out as people buy the books. The operation and maintenance are the affirmative acts that cause the copying to occur.</p><h2>What Happens If This <b>IS</b> the Standard?</h2><p>Consider what could happen if owning, managing and operating a website could <b>not</b> be infringement of the content on that site. Company A could make a perfect copy of everything on the New York Time's website, for example, and sell it to Company B.</p><p>Company B could then sell access to that content in perpetuity and compete with nytimes.com itself, with no worry of copyright infringement. Or it could provide it for free, like BDG is alleged to have done with this photographer's photos, and just sell ads. <b>That cannot be the right result.</b></p><p>Of course, none of those arguments were before the Court. In the briefing and in the complaint, Plaintiff instead focused simply on citing a few cases saying that transmitting a copy of a website can be copyright infringement. But—per the Court—those cases are easily distinguished as involving websites where the accused infringer had made the images available in the first place.</p><p>And you can't fault the Court for taking the arguments as they are presented.</p><p>In my view, plaintiff really needed to spend some time explaining (and pleading) exactly how web sites and web servers work. With that understanding, the facts as alleged set out a clear-cut instance of copyright infringement. Yes, the "patent lawyer effect" is a real thing, where attorneys with certain backgrounds sometimes trend towards hyper-technical and unhelpful briefing, losing the forest for the trees. But this shows that the reverse can be true as well.</p>

<article>
	<p>During last year, due to the pandemic, e-commerce and B2C shipments have skyrocketed, forcing logistics services to face some of their most pressing problems. One of them is certainly how reliant we are on something as low-tech and unsustainable as the ubiquitous cardboard box. The boxes we use for shipping are certainly very cheap (and are a proven reliable solution) but they are mostly used once, quickly ending up in landfills all over the world.Â&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>LivingPackets, a startup in Berlin, wants to change all that with â€œThe Boxâ€�, a smart, sustainable shipping container that can be traced at any time and can be reused for at least a thousand of deliveries. The Box is design to be though and resistant; it includes a tracker, an e-ink screen to dynamically show the parcelâ€™s shipping details, and an internal holder mechanism to keep in place and protect objects of many different shapes. Thanks to its smart features it can be tracked at all times, and it makes tampering and parcel theft a problem of the past.</p>
<p>The new-generation shipping container is, of course, way more expensive than a single cardboard box, but it becomes potentially more economical than the cardboard alternative after a couple hundred times. Moreover, LivingPacket is not planning to sell The Box, instead wants to offer it to online retailers and companies â€œas a serviceâ€�, with the final goal of building a circular economy of shipping.<br>

<p>Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Space Port Sation, Florida — SpaceX made history again by sending a record number of 143 satellites on a single mission to the lower Earth orbit yesterday. The record was previously held by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with 103 satellites on a single launch.</p>



<p>Among these were 10 SpaceX Starlink satellites that are deployed to the Polar Orbit (see animation below for explanation). This will make high-speed internet available in the most remote polar locations of our planet.</p>



<p>The SmallSat rideshare program by SpaceX enables customers in launching their satellites to low Earth orbit (LEO) with a budget as low as $1M. In this dedicated launch, most of the small satellites were of SpaceX customers, in the past, SpaceX has been making space for a small number of customer satellites with the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/14/falcon-9-starlink-launch-58/">Starlink constellation satellites.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>‘s space exploration &amp; commercial spaceflight company has used optical laser-linking of the satellites for the first time. Musk has confirmed on Twitter that the black pipe-type objects at the end of each Starlink satellite are actually laser links. I have marked these objects in the following photo of the SmallSat satellite stack photo shared by SpaceX before the launch.</p>

<p>According to Musk, only the polar <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> satellites sent to orbit this year will have laser links, all the other Starlink satellites will get laser-linking feature next year. SpaceX has given the current laser-linked satellites a version number of v0.9, Musk explained.</p>

<h2>Why Laser Links?</h2>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snoshy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">u/snoshy</a> provided much-needed insight on the use of ‘laser links’ on Starlink satellites as the article made it to the HN front page.</p>



<blockquote><p>These laser links are purely intended for satellite-to-satellite communications for Starlink. They are not (at least at this time, and for the foreseeable future) intended for ground-to-satellite communications.</p><p>The value that sat-to-sat laser links provide is that they create a low latency, high bandwidth path that stays within the Starlink satellite network. Before these 10 satellites, each Starlink satellite has only been capable of communicating directly to ground terminals (either consumer, transit or SpaceX control). For traffic that is intended to move large geographic distances (think transcontinental), this can require several hops back and forth between ground and space, or the traffic from the user terminal is exited at a node that is geared for transiting traffic and most of the data transits along with existing ground Internet links.</p><p>By performing this type of transit directly in space, and exiting at a transit node nearest the destination for the data, you greatly reduce latency. Bandwidth still might not be great, but what this does is unlocks a very financially lucrative consumer use case: low latency finance traffic and critical communications. </p><p>There are many use cases around the world where shaving even 10-20 milliseconds of latency on a data path can unlock finance and emergency capabilities, and this is a long-fought battle throughout the history of these industries. As an example, if you got a piece of news about a company in Australia, and wanted to trade on it as quickly as possible in the USA if you can beat your competitors by 10-20 milliseconds, that can mean a lot of money.</p><p>Laser comms for Starlink sats have long been planned, but have historically proven to be quite hard to get working. They also depend on a sufficient critical mass of satellites so that a given satellite actually does have another satellite within the lock to send the traffic towards.</p><cite>u/snoshy via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25906513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker News discussion</a>.</cite></blockquote>

Over the long term, this change could lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes."</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/sneaking-a-little-junk-food-doesnt-mean-all-is-lost/2018/02/26/828b75fa-1b36-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html">This is your body on fast food</a>, Washington Post</p><p>But we’ve never seen how fast food impacts the body in real-time, over 5 days. We decided to put it to the test with another N of 1 experiment (i.e. not a statistically significant sample size but interesting to do nonetheless).</p><p>Before we get into the data, some key metrics that Basis tracks and for you to follow along:</p><p><b>Fasting glucose:</b> This is the glucose test you're likely most familiar with. It's the test you do in the morning, after you've fasted for 8-10 hours. The normal range for blood glucose is 70 to 100 mg/dl (but values may vary for different labs). Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dl are referred to as impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm"></a>. Diabetes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm"></a>is typically diagnosed when fasting blood glucose levels are 126 mg/dl or higher. Basis acquires its data from a glucose sensor that measures glucose in the interstitial fluid - not in serum (blood). Measurements can vary up to 10-15% between the results you would get in a lab.</p><p><b>Time in range:</b> Minimizing the number of glucose spikes and more time spent in the optimal glucose range of 70-110 is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127824">observed in healthy (non-diabetic) adults</a>. </p><p><b>Glucose variability:</b> Glucose variability is the amount of variation that you experience with your glucose throughout the day. Maintaining steadier glucose variation over time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4543190/#:~:text=Glycemic%20variability%20(GV)%2C%20which,same%20time%20on%20different%20days.">leads to better health outcomes</a>. In healthy, non-diabetic adults, glucose variability targets are &lt;13%.</p><p><b>Heart rate variability (HRV): </b>HRV measures the beat-to-beat variations of your heart rate throughout the day. HRV provides insights into how your heartbeats change over time and is now a crucial measure of overall well-being and physical fitness.</p><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> We don’t recommend that anyone try eating fast food with every meal for a week. If you’re already doing it, we hope this post can have even the slightest of impact in helping you transition towards eating healthier. </p><p><b>Day 1</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p><u>Glucose</u></p><p>Low: 85 / Average: 102 / High: 144</p><p>Fasting glucose: 88</p><p>Time in range: 85.5%</p><p>Glucose variability: 13.12</p><p><u>Heart rate</u></p><p>Low: 49 / Average: 99 / High: 174</p><p>HRV: 36.69</p><p><u>Meals</u></p><p><i>Breakfast: </i>Starbucks coffee w/ milk and sugar + butter croissant.</p><p><i>Lunch:</i> Cheeseburger with fries and a beer.</p><p><i>Snacks: Cookies.</i></p><p><i>Dinner:</i> Pizza and a Coke.</p><p><b>Day 2</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p><u>Glucose</u></p><p>Low: 76 / Average: 103 / High: 142</p><p>Fasting glucose: 88</p><p>Time in range: 71%</p><p>Glucose variability: 11.82</p><p><u>Heart rate</u></p><p>Low: 51 / Average: 73 / High: 113</p><p>HRV: 17.66</p><p><i>Breakfast: </i>Starbucks coffee w/ milk and sugar + a chocolate croissant.</p><p><i>Lunch:</i> KFC nuggets w/ fries and a Coke.</p><p><i>Snacks:</i> Cookies.</p><p><i>Dinner: C</i>hicken in sweet sauce with fries and a 7up. </p><p><b>Day 3</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p>This was the worst day of the week.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="header2">



	<h2>Market</h2>
	<div><p>
I've built SkyAlt to make my programming better. Now I wanna give it to programmers out there.

Here are possible use-cases for SkyAlt right now:
</p><p>

<b>Learning how to code</b>
<br>

There are plenty of platforms already. <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> is really hot these days.
</p><p>

<b>Internet of Things</b>
<br>
<a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> has been around for some time and has a big community and eco-system already.
</p><p>

<b>In-house(Internal) tools</b>
<br>
This market is huge! There are really good companies: <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://retool.com/">Retool</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>.
</p><p>

<b>Internet-scale Operation system</b>
<br>
There are tens of companies which try to build Internet-scale computer(not OS): <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://dfinity.org/">Dfinity</a>, <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR Protocol</a>, etc.. Most of them are in private beta stages. Only a few published their product and I see many unsolved problems. I like this challenge a lot!
	</p></div>


	<h2>Long-term vision</h2>
	<div><p>
The problem which spread through the whole tech industry(and far beyond) is <b>artificial trust</b>, which is "created" by manipulating users and customers by shaping the brand and promising stability and security. You can see it in growing pressure on social networks and app stores. The core problem is that back-ends are black boxes and their owners can change the rules anytime. There is no way how cloud providers and SaaS companies can provide real trust.
</p><p>

That cloud of problems can be solved with blockchain and transparent governance. For example, try to imagine a P2P app store where everything is source-available(or open-source) and rules would be set by the community. No data lock-in and all apps are transparent and run all the time, no matter what. In other words, what we need is <b>mathematical proofs, that we can trust!</b></p><p>

My long-term vision for SkyAlt is an Internet-scale Operation system. SkyAlt will be the platform, where you build, debug, test, deploy and update secure decentralized apps as simple as possible. It's one holistic language for front-end and back-end. The difference between internet-scale computer and OS is that the computer is a bottom layer(machine code, assembler, bytecode), compare to OS, which is a place way more accessible to humans.
</p><p>

Many people work on the solution, but there is still a lot of blockchain R&amp;D that needs to be done. It's too early, I can't build DApp platform right now, but can I market it?
	</p></div>


	<h2>Short-term goal</h2>
	<div><p>
Ok, so I need something which attracts developers and is very useful for them today. The important part is that what they build today they will have to be able to re-use it in the future to build DApps(decentralize applications). Luckily, the other use case for SkyAlt is building in-house software and I can see how In-house and DApps use-cases overlap.
</p><p>

The many startups who try to build blockchain computers face the chicken-egg problem. No one knows what the killer DApps are in this new space, so it's not easy to attract developers. In my case, I wanna build a community of developers on the in-house tools market which is huge and predictable already. So today developers can build in-house tools and later they may run that code(or parts) on the internet-scale computer.
</p><p>

Even I'm not making a DApps platform right now, the direction of the in-house tools must be compatible with the long term vision. So SkyAlt has to be open-source(Apache 2.0), unlimited and free. Competition on the in-house tools market must charge their customers, but I'll monetize through the DApps platform, so you can make in-house tools for free and it's gonna stay like that. The source code is under Apache 2.0 without any extra clause, so there is no other way anyway.
</p><p>

Let's see the competition on the in-house tools market. Airtable and Zapier are very easy to use, so their typical user is not a programmer. On another side when they don't support your use-case, you can extend it, but you have to know how to code.
</p><p>

Retool is different. First of all, you can build GUI with drag &amp; drop, but you don't write code in one main editor, instead you write chunks of code into pre-define attributes in panels. From my point of view, this is it's a weakness because code is split across GUI. If it was in one text(file), you can review and understand it quicker.
</p><p>

SkyAlt is different, because everything that you do, you can see as code in a text file, but in more and more situations you can use GUI to generate and shape that code without writing anything. Debugging is also fun. I've started to add new APIs to support this new direction(In-house apps) and I've built 3 demos.
	</p></div>


	<h2>Demo - Orders</h2>
	<div><p>
I've already mention Retool. This demo recreates project which you can see on their <a href="https://retool.com/">home page</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZrJtnCKlxk">youtube</a>.
</p><p>

I was really interested in achieving the same result with few lines of code. And If you think about it, what they did in the video are these few steps.
<a href="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/code.png"><img src="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/code.png" alt="Code" width="720"></a>
The code is both(back/front-end) in one! I didn't write the whole code. It was created by dragging &amp; dropping, auto-complete, and writing a few expressions aka parameters.
</p><p>

In the background, I run MariaDB, which is connected through ODBC. In the video, you can see step-by-step debugging and how the final app works.
	</p></div>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/orders.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/orders.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 


	<h2>Demo - Analytics</h2>
	<div><p>
The hardest part of this demo was to create the connecter(guide) which connects to google analytics. This is not in the video. Then It was quick to write REST call, which downloads data, which are then projected into the chart.
</p><p>
You can pick the color, set start &amp; end dates, and change time-step(hourly, daily, etc.).
	</p></div>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/analytics.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/analytics.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 


	<h2>Demo - Map</h2>
	<p>
With this demo, I tried to go low level. It downloads tiles from the OSM server, computes tile's positions on the screen, and draw them. You can set latitude, longitude, and zoom of the camera in edit boxes at the bottom. It also draws map scale at the left-bottom corner and can visualize position with markers. Tile files are cached on disk.
	</p>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/map.jpg">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/inhouse/map.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 


	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<div><p>
I like the challenge of building Internet-scale OS. But It's too early. On another side with a platform where you can build in-house software, I can control and predict the future much better. This should create a community of developers who will re-use their code for building DApps later.
</p><p>

This is only the beginning. There is so much more and it's coming.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Page speed and UX</strong> will be important forces that will take brands a few steps ahead in the digital race of 2021. So where exactly will you be in this race?</p><p>Powerful tasks offered by Screpy experts and comprehensive analysis reporting from a single point will enable you to track the speed of more projects in a more practical way. We will talk about the contribution of all these to SEO exactly now. Ready to get started?</p><h2>User Experience and Page Speed: You Are What You Offer!</h2><p>UX refers to the experience of a user who enters your website, depending on all factors, from colors, buttons, font to the general theme, content to site speed. Page speed determines how quickly users can access the content they request.</p><p>Now consider the web of the Internet where millions of different pages are ranked for each keyword. How likely are you to give a chance more than once to a site that loads very slowly or responds very slowly to your interactions?</p><p><em>Let’s say: not much</em>. Because there are websites with extremely rich content that will give you a perfect web experience by paying attention to UX on the internet. Moreover, this competition is valid for almost every sector.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, web speed does not only affect e-commerce sites. Since e-commerce sites directly analyze behaviors such as adding a product to the chart or purchasing an item, the speed optimization of these sites is extremely valuable. However, the user who cannot get around through the categories even on a standard blog site becomes the user who will add +1 digits to the bounce rate tab in a short time.</p><p><strong><em>What does bounce rate mean</em>?</strong> Bounce rate refers to the rate of ‘’abandoning the website’’ of the user just before he or she enters it. As you can imagine, a website that is difficult to load or navigate between pages means a website with an increased bounce rate. So even if the traffic is high in the first process, low UX and low conversion negatively affect traffic and SEO over time.<br></p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="944" height="483" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index.png" alt="Speed Index" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index.png 944w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index-300x153.png 300w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index-768x393.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"></figure><h3>Page Speed Manages Brand Perception: Other Side of UX</h3><p>User Experience also includes how a user feels about your brand’s product or service.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that a YSL user feels special and an Adidas user feels modern and powerful, right? That is what we called brand psychology. The values you attribute to your brand will also affect the experience your customers get from the brands’ products.</p><p><strong><em>Let’s meet a fact:&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>A fast web page also affects your brand prestige in the eyes of the user. According to a study, especially when e-commerce site users experience situations such as freezing, crashing, taking too long to load, they prefer not to make a purchase from that site. Because this negative experience leaves the users an impression that the website they are on is not professional and competent enough.</p><p>Did that seem too striking to you? The bottom line is that this doesn’t just apply to buying behavior. Unless you support the user’s experience on your website with strong page speed rates, you will forgo the professional appearance of your platform.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, which professional platform would be too careless to take the necessary measures for page speed?</p><h3>There Is More To Talk About: Organic Search Rankings and Page Speed</h3><p>Now, we now know very well that page speed is in constant interaction with the following concepts:</p><ol><li>User experience</li><li>Bounce rate</li><li>SEO (Search engine optimization)</li><li>Purchasing behavior</li><li>Conversion rates</li><li>Organic traffic</li></ol><p>What about organic search engine rankings? Imagine trying to boost your website’s SERP rankings by doing search engine optimization. Better rankings will mean the following:</p><ul><li>Getting more visibility with less need for extra SEM budget,</li><li>To increase traffic organically,</li><li>Increasing brand recognition,</li><li>Increasing sales rates.</li></ul><p><strong><em>So, how does all this relate to SEO?</em></strong></p><p>Google cares that the websites it offers for its users are platforms with high performance and powerful UX. That’s why Google Pagespeed tries to predict the performance of websites using various metrics that measure speed.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="943" height="421" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report.png" alt="Google Pagespeed Performance Metrics" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report.png 943w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report-300x134.png 300w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report-768x343.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px"><figcaption>Performance Insights</figcaption></figure><p>Would you like to take a look at how many seconds of page loading speed performances together create a theoretical UX?

Also, page speed performance is an important metric that is evaluated directly within Google Insights, according to Google’s official statements.</p><h3>How is user experience is affected by page speed and how does it affect SEO?</h3><p>User experience varies depending on the page speed performance. A low performance means low UX. Low UX generates the user’s request to leave the site. This means that the bounce rate increases. A website with a high bounce rate will have a low SEO score.</p><h3>How is SEO affected by user experience and page speed?&nbsp;</h3><p>Low SEO score can be caused by low page speed values ​​or low UX scores. This prevents the web page from reaching high rankings in organic search result pages. This makes it difficult to attract user traffic to the website. In that scenario, a powerful UX experience is not provided and the traffic opportunity is missed.<br></p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="728" height="529" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/page-load-time.png" alt="Page Load Time Scale" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/page-load-time.png 728w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/page-load-time-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></figure><h2>What Do Current Studies Say About The Relationship Between Page Speed ​​and User Experience?</h2><ul><li>The most recent studies showed that among e-commerce site users, those who experienced a 400-millisecond latency decrease their visiting behavior by 0.44 percent in the first three-week period and 0.76 percent in the second three-week period.</li><li>Another study revealed that performing page speed only for the pc is a rather problematic strategy.

<p>I spent this week debug­ging an issue with an inter­nal web tool that our company’s sup­port team relies upon to pull up infor­ma­tion about our cus­tomers, mak­ing changes on their behalf to their sub­scrip­tions of the var­i­ous pack­ages and ser­vices that we offer. Try­ing to view one par­tic­u­lar cus­tomer — one! — would always crash the appli­ca­tion, leav­ing an unhelp­ful mes­sage that said, “Inter­nal Serv­er Error: Please con­tact the serv­er admin­is­tra­tor. More infor­ma­tion about this error may be avail­able in the serv­er error log.” Unfor­tu­nate­ly, there was only a sin­gle line in the log, “Error 500,” which only indi­cat­ed that yes, an error had hap­pened on the serv­er. No details from the application.</p>



<p>Luck­i­ly, this appli­ca­tion was writ­ten in Perl, an expres­sive pro­gram­ming lan­guage with a rich ecosys­tem of open-source libraries. It also has a built-in debug­ger mode that can run your pro­gram step by step, line by line. Any pro­gram that can be run from the text com­mand line can be paused, have its vari­ables and objects exam­ined, new code inter­ac­tive­ly entered, and then con­tin­ue its exe­cu­tion as if noth­ing had happened.</p>



<p>How­ev­er, this was a web appli­ca­tion that assumed it was run­ning in a web serv­er envi­ron­ment, and the customer’s infor­ma­tion was in our pro­duc­tion data­base, safe from pry­ing eyes (includ­ing curi­ous devel­op­ers like me) due to finan­cial com­pli­ance rules. I could not sim­ply run this pro­gram on my desk­top and repro­duce the prob­lem with this one cus­tomer — I had to some­how tease out more infor­ma­tion from a run­ning sys­tem and report it back using the only tool avail­able: the serv­er error log men­tioned above.</p>



<p>But still, the Perl debug­ger approach was appeal­ing. Could I some­how get the appli­ca­tion to log each line of code as it was exe­cut­ed? Could I then see what was run­ning the moment before it crashed, the offend­ing line print­ed in the log like a smok­ing gun that had just mur­dered its vic­tim? And assum­ing that the prob­lem was in our code and not in the mil­lions of lines of third-par­ty code it depend­ed upon, could I fil­ter out all the&nbsp;noise?</p>



<p>The answer, thank­ful­ly, was yes; since the debug­ger itself is writ­ten in Perl and designed to be extend­ed or replaced, I could add code at the begin­ning of our appli­ca­tion that inter­cept­ed each line as it was run, throw out any­thing that came from a file out­side of our application’s direc­to­ry fold­er, and then report the rest (along with help­ful line num­bers) to the error log. Then turn on the “debug” switch on the web serv­er run­ning the appli­ca­tion, and voilà, the log would duti­ful­ly fill up with (slow­er, more mem­o­ry-con­sum­ing) code report­ed by the debugger.</p>



<p>We set up our stag­ing serv­er to use the branch of code with debug­ging enabled, and then instruct­ed the appli­ca­tion to dis­play the prob­lem­at­ic cus­tomer’s records. As expect­ed, the error log imme­di­ate­ly began fill­ing up with line after line of our application’s code and then bang, crashed right after issu­ing a par­tic­u­lar data­base query for ser­vices tied to the account. I had my smok­ing gun! After extract­ing the query and run­ning it on a redact­ed copy of our data­base, I found that it was return­ing some 1.9 mil­lion rows of data as it retrieved pro­vi­sion­ing, billing, and renew­al his­to­ry for every ser­vice owned by the cus­tomer. This was far too many than nec­es­sary — the appli­ca­tion only cares about cur­rent sta­tus, and it was run­ning out of mem­o­ry as it cre­at­ed ser­vice objects for each&nbsp;row.</p>



<p>The data­base expert on my team was able to adjust the query to return only cur­rent infor­ma­tion, and after a quick test on the redact­ed data­base, the change is now wait­ing for qual­i­ty assur­ance test­ing before launch­ing to our pro­duc­tion servers. The debug­ging code branch will be saved until it’s need­ed again, and our team was once again grate­ful that we were work­ing in such a pow­er­ful pro­gram­ming lan­guage as&nbsp;Perl.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Nine months ago, we embarked on a format migration for the persistent
(on-disk) representation of variable-length strings like symbolicated
call stacks in the <a href="https://www.backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a> server. We
chose a variant of
<a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf">consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS)</a>,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">self-synchronising code</a>,
for the metadata (variable-length as well).
This choice let us improve our software’s resilience to data
corruption in local files, and then parallelise data hydration, which
improved startup times by a factor of 10… without any hard
migration from the old to the current on-disk data format.</p><p>In this post, I will explain why I believe that the representation of
first resort for binary logs (write-ahead, recovery, replay, or
anything else that may be consumed by a program) should be
self-synchronising, backed by this migration and by prior experience
with COBS-style encoding. I will also describe the
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/stuffed-record-stream">specific algorithm (available under the MIT license)</a>
we implemented for our server software.</p><p>This encoding offers low space overhead for framing, fast encoding and
faster decoding, resilience to data corruption, and a restricted form
of random access. Maybe it makes sense to use it for your own data!</p><h2 id="what-is-self-synchronisation-and-why-is-it-important">What is self-synchronisation, and why is it important?</h2><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">code is self-synchronising</a>
when it’s always possible to unambiguously detect where a valid code
word (record) starts in a stream of symbols (bytes). That’s a
stronger property than prefix codes like Huffman codes, which only
detect when valid code words end. For example, the UTF-8
encoding is self-synchronising, because initial bytes and continuation
bytes differ in their high bits. That’s why it’s possible to decode
multi-byte code points when tailing a UTF-8 stream.</p><p>The UTF-8 code was designed for small integers (Unicode code points),
and can double the size of binary data. Other encodings are more
appropriate for arbitrary bytes; for example,
<a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf">consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS)</a>,
a self-synchronising code for byte streams, offers a worst-case
space overhead of one byte plus a 0.4% space blow-up.</p><p>Self-synchronisation is important for binary logs because it lets us
efficiently (with respect to both run time and space overhead) frame
records in a simple and robust manner… and we want simplicity and
robustness because logs are most useful when something has gone wrong.</p><p>Of course, the storage layer should detect and correct errors, but
things will sometimes fall through, especially for on-premises
software, where no one fully controls deployments. When that happens,
graceful partial failure is preferable to, e.g., losing all the
information in a file because one of its pages went to the great bit
bucket in the sky.</p><p>One easy solution is to spread the data out over multiple files or
blobs. However, there’s a trade-off between keeping data
fragmentation and file metadata overhead in check, and minimising the
blast radius of minor corruption. Our server must be able to run
on isolated nodes, so we can’t rely on design options available to
replicated systems… plus bugs tend to be correlated across replicas,
so there is something to be said for defense in depth, even with
distributed storage.</p><p>When each record is converted with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">self-synchronising code</a>
like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing">COBS</a>
before persisting to disk, we can decode all records that weren’t
directly impacted by corruption, exactly like decoding a stream of
mostly valid UTF-8 bytes. Any form of corruption will only make
us lose the records whose bytes were corrupted, and, at most, the two records
that immediately precede or follow the corrupt byte range. This
guarantee covers overwritten data (e.g., when a network switch flips a
bit, or a read syscall silently errors out with a zero-filled page),
as well as bytes removed or garbage inserted in the middle of log
files.</p><p>The coding doesn’t store redundant information: replication or erasure
coding is the storage layer’s responsibility. It instead guarantees
to <em>always</em> minimise the impact of corruption, and only lose records
that were adjacent to or directly hit by corruption.</p><p>A COBS encoding for log records achieves that by unambiguously
separating records with a reserved byte (e.g., 0), and re-encoding
each record to avoid that separator byte. A reader can thus assume
that potential records start and end at a log file’s first and last
bytes, and otherwise look for separator bytes to determine where to
cut all potential records. These records may be invalid: a
separator byte could be introduced or removed by corruption, and the
contents of a correctly framed record may be corrupt. When
that happens, readers can simply scan for the next separator byte and
try to validate that new potential record. The decoder’s state resets
after each separator byte, so any corruption is “forgotten” as soon as
the decoder finds valid a separator byte.</p><p>On the write side, the encoding logic is simple (a couple dozen lines
of C code), and uses a predictable amount of space, as expected from
an algorithm suitable for microcontrollers.</p><p>Actually writing encoded data is also easy:
on POSIX filesystems, we can make sure each record is delimited (e.g.,
prefixed with the delimiter byte), and issue a
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/write.html">regular <code>O_APPEND</code> write(2)</a>.
Vectored writes can even insert delimiters without copying in
userspace. Realistically, our code is probably less stable than
operating system and the hardware it runs on, so we make sure our
writes make it to the kernel as soon as possible, and let <code>fsync</code>s
happen on a timer.</p><p>When a write errors out, we can blindly (maybe once or twice) try
again: the encoding is independent of the output file’s state. When a
write is cut short, we can still issue the same<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> write call,
without trying to “fix” the short write: the encoding and the
read-side logic already protect against that kind of corruption.</p><p>What if multiple threads or processes write to the same log file?
When we <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/open.html">open with <code>O_APPEND</code></a>,
the operating system can handle the rest. This doesn’t make
contention disappear, but at least we’re not adding a bottleneck in
userspace on top of what is necessary to append to the same file.
Buffering is also trivial: the encoding is independent of the state of
the destination file, so we can always concatenate buffered records
and write the result with a single syscall.</p><p>This simplicity also plays well with
<a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">high-throughput I/O primitives like <code>io_uring</code></a>, and with
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/append-block">blob stores that support appends</a>:
independent workers can concurrently queue up blind append requests and
retry on failure.
There’s no need for application-level mutual exclusion or rollback.</p><h2 id="fun-tricks-with-robust-readers">Fun tricks with robust readers</h2><p>Our log encoding will recover from bad bytes, as long as readers can
detect and reject invalid records as a whole; the processing logic
should also handle duplicated valid records. These are table stakes
for a reliable log consumer.</p><p>In our variable-length metadata use case, each record describes a
symbolicated call stack, and we recreate in-memory data structures by
replaying an append-only log of metadata records, one for each
unique call stack. The hydration phase handles invalid records by
ignoring (not recreating) any call stack with corrupt metadata,
but only those call stacks. That’s definitely an improvement over the
previous situation, where corruption in a size header would prevent us
from decoding the remainder of the file, and thus make us forget about
<em>all</em> call stacks stored at file offsets after the corruption.</p><p>Of course, losing data should be avoided, so we are careful to
<code>fsync</code> regularly and recommend reasonable storage configurations.
However, one can only make data loss unlikely, not impossible (if only
due to fat fingering), especially when cost is a factor. With the COBS
encoding, we can recover gracefully and automatically from any
unfortunate data corruption event.</p><p>We can also turn this robustness into new capabilities.</p><p>It’s often useful to process the tail of a log at a regular cadence.
For example, I once maintained a system that regularly tailed hourly
logs to update approximate views. One could support that use case with
length footers. COBS framing lets us instead scan
for a valid record from an arbitrary byte location, and read the rest
of the data normally.</p><p>When logs grow large enough, we want to process them in parallel. The
standard solution is to shard log streams, which unfortunately couples
the parallelisation and storage strategies, and adds complexity to the
write side.</p><p>COBS framing lets us parallelise readers independently of the writer.
The downside is that the read-side code and I/O patterns are now more
complex, but, all other things being equal, that’s a trade-off I’ll
gladly accept, especially given that our servers run on independent
machines and store their data in files, where reads are fine-grained
and latency relatively low.</p><p>A parallel COBS reader partitions a data file arbitrarily (e.g., in
fixed size chunks) for independent workers. A worker will scan for
the first valid record starting inside its assigned chunk, and handle
every record that <em>starts</em> in its chunk. Filtering on the start byte
means that a worker may read past the logical end of its chunk, when
it fully decodes the last record that starts in the chunk: that’s how
we unambiguously assign a worker to every record, including records
that straddle chunk boundaries.</p><p>Random access even lets us implement a form of binary or interpolation
search on raw unindexed logs, when we know the records are (k-)sorted
on the search key! This lets us, e.g., access the metadata for a few
call stacks without parsing the whole log.</p><p>Eventually, we might also want to truncate our logs.</p><p>Contemporary filesystems like XFS (and even Ext4) support large sparse
files. For example, sparse files can reach \(2^{63} - 1\) bytes on
XFS with a minimal metadata-only footprint: the on-disk data for such
sparse files is only allocated when we issue actual writes. Nowadays,
we can <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/415889/">sparsify files after the fact</a>,
and convert ranges of non-zero data into zero-filled “holes” in order
to release storage without messing with file …</p></div></article></div></div>

As threats of a second school lock-down came to fruition I bit the bullet and ordered a pair.</p><h2 id="my-requirements">My requirements</h2><p>At this point its worth stating what I was <em>hoping</em> for from the Airpods Max, in priority order:</p><ol><li>Headphone noise cancellation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants coming to my ears</li><li>Microphone voice isolation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants reaching the ears of participants on video calls</li><li>Good-to-great sound quality of my voice on video calls</li><li>Great sound quality for listening to music while working</li></ol><h2 id="most-of-what-has-been-written-about-the-airpods-max-is-true">Most of what has been written about the Airpods Max is true</h2><p>The headphones arrived the second full week of January, a week before my wife and I had to start home-schooling the kids again but a time when both of us were back juggling full-time jobs with minding our 6, 8 and 10 year olds, plus the 10 month old puppy. </p><p>I'm not going to say much about the good bits of the Airpods Max because plenty has already been written on that. They do sound really great for music and for films. The most noticable thing to me was the way they project the sound in front of me when I'm listening to a normal stereo video on Youtube/Twitter/TikTok etc on the iPhone. It comes across as a very definite sound projection of about 30cms. I wouldn't say I like it especially more, but it's definitely a thing.</p><p>The ANC is exceptionally good at cutting out background noise. It fades it when you turn it on and I love the effect - it brings to mind a sound <em>animation</em>. I have subsequently tried a pair of Bose NC 700s and I can categorically say that the ANC on the Airpods Max is more effective at cutting out the normal background noise in my house.</p><p>However, as implied by the title, this isn't an article with a happy ending. In the end I had to send the Airpods Max back to Apple for a refund because they were four things that just did not work out for my use case. Without further ado, here they are...</p><h2 id="the-noise-cancellation-sucked">The noise cancellation sucked</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's tak about that ANC again. The use of 'sucked' in the title isn't (just) click-bait. The very first thing I noticed about the Airpods Max was that the ANC didn't feel great in my ears. I'd describe it as like the feeling you have when you need to repressurise your ears on an airplane. It doesn't bother you particularly at the time but when you swallow you realise it feels better. Taking off the Airpods Max felt like returning my inner ears to their natural, unadorned state. When I posted this on Twitter, @madmax helpfully pointed me to <a href="https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/178-eardrum-suck-the-mystery-solved">an article</a> about <em>Eardrum Suck</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> which I'm inclined to believe is the issue here. The ANC effect is very good at filtering out background noise, but it definitely <em>feels</em> like an effect.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>And then there is event noise. Event noise is what I'm calling any sudden loud noise that is over and above the normal background din. In my environment that is raised voices, dog barks, footsteps on the wooden floor, metallic noises from the kitchen and the previously described <em>ka-thunk</em> of closing doors. The ANC on the Airpods Max does not do well with any of these. To be fair it is a tough challenge. But what I was not expecting, what blew me away<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> was that low frequency event noise (e.g. a <em>ka-thunk</em> of a door) could actually create an uncomfortable ANC burp right into my ear drum. Like a Q-tip that's gone too deep. It's not pleasant and it happens every 10 minutes in my house. Imagine that - a Q-tip to the ear drum every 10 minutes! It doesn't take much of that to make a man want to take his headphones off his irreplaceable ear drums, no matter how expensive they were!</p>

It will negotiate a two-way SCO connection that reduces the audio quality for both the input and the output device. Yes that's right. If the microphone is active, everything sounds worse too. How much worse? Well I'm glad you asked. My desktop Mac<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> uses a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset. When the Airpods Max connect to a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset you end up with 8kHz audio. You can search the internet for this - it also happens for the regular Airpods and Airpods Pro. If you've been on a Zoom call with someone using Airpods that sounded like they are on the world's worst telephone - this is probably the reason. It can support 48kHz streaming audio simplex but only 8kHz duplex. I'm not a Bluetooth engineer but something doesn't add up here.</p>

It's better... and frankly if my desktop Mac had been able to achieve this I might not have noticed the quality problem until after the return window had closed. But we are still getting a sub-par audio experience if the microphones are in use. The standard response from pretty much <em>everyone</em> on the internet is to turn off the device as an input source and use the internal microphone on your machine. They even have complicated instructions on how to fool the Mac into doing this automatically and one of the most popular apps for Airpods management <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> has the ability to force this built-in. </p><p>Hell no.</p><p>I did not spend all this money on headphones with noise-isolating microphones just to <em>turn it off</em>.</p><p>On my iPhone 11 Pro things are better still.

But suffice to say that if you are getting 24kHz duplex then you can probably stop worrying about wireless quality problems. I wish I had a modern Mac with Bluetooth 5 built in to verify that the same is acheiveable on a modern chipset Mac. I'd be willing to believe so and it leaves me confident that Apple are <em>never</em> going to invest the time in making this better for older hardware.

January 25, 2021 | https://frontaid.io/blog/fluid-typography-2d-css-locks-clamp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://frontaid.io/blog/fluid-typography-2d-css-locks-clamp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p><strong>FrontAid CMS - Agile Content Management with JSON &amp; Git.</strong></p><p>» <a href="https://frontaid.io/">FrontAid CMS</a> / <a href="https://frontaid.io/blog/">Blog</a></p><p>Websites are being used from the smallest smart watches to the largest TV screens.
And the whole point of <em>responsive webdesign</em> is to adapt to all those devices.
One of the things that thus has to be considered is sizing (e.g. <code>font-size</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, …).
How much spacing should be applied on desktop computers compared to mobile phones?
What font sizes are useful on what devices?</p><p>It makes a lot of sense to have <strong>smaller spacings and slightly smaller fonts on mobile</strong>.
The former because of the smaller viewport size and the latter because smaller devices tend to be closer to the user’s eyes.
With regards to the font size, this approach is often called <strong>fluid typography</strong>.
Traditionally, those adaptions to the screen size often have been done using
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">Media Queries</a>,
mostly relying on the viewport
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width">width</a>.
But there is an easier way as we will show in this post.</p><p>Note that this website is a demo of that approach.
You can see it by resizing the browser window; the font sizes and spacings will adapt fluently.
On smaller windows, everything will be slightly smaller than on larger windows.
And the font size will never be smaller or larger than their predefined values.
All of that is possible without any breakpoint.</p><h2 id="css-locks">CSS Locks</h2><p>“CSS Locks” is a mechanism to linearly scale a size in between a minimum and maximum bound.
A common usage of CSS Locks is to scale font sizes depending on the current screen width.
But as small font sizes are unreadable (and large ones are impractical), you also need to define a minimum (and maximum) size.
You can read a <a href="https://fvsch.com/css-locks#toc-1">quick introduction to CSS Locks</a>
or the full, detailed mathematical explanation in <a href="https://fvsch.com/css-locks/">The math of CSS Locks</a>.</p><h2 id="two-dimensional-css-locks">Two-dimensional CSS Locks</h2><p>While CSS Locks are usually based on the viewport width (or height) only, two-dimensional CSS Locks consider both dimensions at the same time.
That is important because there are different aspect ratios of screens and also different orientations.
For example, having <strong>different font sizes on a device in portrait mode compared to landscape mode does not make sense</strong>.
But that is exactly what normally happens with ordinary CSS Locks as they are bound to width (or height) only.</p><p>In our example, we want to adapt spacings and font sizes automatically based on the viewport size.
As we consider both the width and height, our styling will work equally well on displays in portrait or landscape mode.</p><h3 id="defining-the-base-size">Defining the Base Size</h3><p>The perfect start to achieve responsive sizes given the viewport dimensions is by using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#rem"><code>rem</code> unit</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Represents the <code>font-size</code> of the root element (typically <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>).
When used within the root element <code>font-size</code>, it represents its initial value (a common browser default is 16px, but user-defined preferences may modify this).</p></blockquote><p><code>rem</code>s are evaluated relative to the root font size defined by either the browser or the website’s CSS.
For example given a base font size of <code>16px</code>, <code>1rem</code> is equivalent to 1 × <code>16px</code> and <code>1.5rem</code> is equivalent to 1.5 × <code>16px</code> = <code>24px</code>.
Below you can see an example of how you can use those units.
Note that even though they are based on the root <code>font-size</code>, <code>rem</code> units can be applied to every property that is bound to a length or size like <code>margin</code>, <code>width</code>, or <code>line-height</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>html</span> <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>16</span><span>px</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>body</span> <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>rem</span><span>;</span> <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>rem</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>h1</span>   <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>rem</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>With that setup it is easy to make sizes smaller or larger.
The only thing you have to do is to update the <code>font-size</code> within the <code>html</code> selector.
For example, changing it to <code>html { font-size: 20px; }</code> will increase <em>all</em> sizes that use the <code>rem</code> unit.
As already mentioned, this step is most often done by using media queries as can be seen in the example below.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@</span><span>media</span> <span>(</span><span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>540px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>html</span> <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>16</span><span>px</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
<span>@</span><span>media</span> <span>(</span><span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>720px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>html</span> <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>17</span><span>px</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
<span>@</span><span>media</span> <span>(</span><span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>960px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>html</span> <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>18</span><span>px</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
<span>@</span><span>media</span> <span>(</span><span>min-width</span><span>:</span> <span>961px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>html</span> <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>19</span><span>px</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That approach is OK and well-known.
But it is also known that those breakpoints can be arbitrary.
Depending on your user’s devices, the sizing can thus be suboptimal.
Especially shortly before approaching and shortly after reaching a break point.
For example, your layout can work well on a screen with a width of 960 pixels.
But smaller devices with a screen width of 721 pixels will have the exact same font size and spacings.
The screen estate of the smaller device might thus be wasted with unnecessary spacings.
The user might have to scroll more and their user experience suffers.
And that just because their device is on the wrong side of a break point.
This is exactly where two-dimensional CSS Locks come into play.
They provide a way to <strong>have the base size scaled to the device</strong> and there are no hard break points anymore.</p><h3 id="css-clamp-function">CSS clamp() Function</h3><p>In order to set up our own CSS Lock, we will be using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp()"><code>clamp()</code> CSS function</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>clamp()</code> CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound.
<code>clamp()</code> enables selecting a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum and maximum.
It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value.</p></blockquote><p><code>clamp()</code> is perfect for a CSS Lock as it does exactly what we want.
Note that <code>clamp()</code> is a relatively recent addition to CSS and some older browsers don’t support it.
But all of the important browsers support it just fine.
So for our use case, we can use <code>clamp()</code> without any compatibility issue.
Browsers that support it evaluate it correctly, and those that do not support it just ignore it.</p><h3 id="2d-css-locks">2D CSS Locks</h3><p>Specifying a CSS Lock is not trivial as the same values have to be repeated a couple of times, sometimes with a unit and sometimes without.
Thus it is highly recommended to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a> (also known as <em>CSS Variables</em>) to make it easier.
In what follows, we will create a CSS expression using <code>clamp()</code> that calculates the root font size using four parameters which are defined as CSS properties.</p><ul><li><code>--minSize</code> is the minimum font size that is applied on tiny screens.</li><li><code>--maxSize</code> is the maximum font size that is applied on large screens.</li><li><code>--minDim</code> is the minimum viewport dimension at which the scaling of the font size starts (minimum font size is applied for smaller viewports).</li><li><code>--maxDim</code> is the maximum viewport dimension at which the scaling of the font size stops (maximum font size is applied for larger viewports).</li></ul><p>Note that all parameters are numbers without a unit and evaluated as pixel sizes/dimensions.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>html</span> <span>{</span>

<span>h1</span>   <span>{</span> <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>rem</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That expression looks a little daunting, so let’s break it down.
The <code>font-size</code> is declared as <code>clamp(minSize, preferredSize, maxSize)</code>.
Given the example parameters, <code>preferredSize</code> will be evaluated as <code>calc(16px + (22 - 16) * ((100vmin - 320px) / (1200 - 320)))</code>.
That is exactly the formula that was explained in <a href="https://fvsch.com/css-locks/">The math of CSS Locks</a>.
In this example the minimum (font) size of 16 pixels will be applied for viewport dimensions smaller or equal to 320 pixels.
The maximum (font) size of 22 pixels will be applied for viewport dimensions larger than 1200 pixels.
In between viewport dimensions of 320 to 1200 pixels, the base size will scale linearly from 16 to 22 pixels.</p><p>Note that we mentioned “viewport dimension”, and not just width or height.
It is a two-dimensional CSS Lock that is applied based on the smaller dimension of <em>either</em> the width or the height.
That is being achieved by using <code>100vmin</code> (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length">CSS length units</a> for details).</p><p>Now that we have defined a root size on the <code>html</code> element, we can use the <code>rem</code> unit whenever we want to define a (font) size.
You can change the parameters that we used however you want.
Just be aware that a sensible choice for the minimum font size is usually “16px” and thus most font-size-related <code>rem</code> rules should be 1 or higher.</p><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2><p>Smaller devices have less screen estate and tend to be closer to the user’s eyes.
Both of those reasons encourage us to decrease spacings and font sizes (fluid typography) accordingly.
But using media queries or regular one-dimensional CSS Locks may cause suboptimal usage of the screen—especially on widescreens or mobile devices in landscape mode.
Two-dimensional CSS Locks thus consider both the viewport width and height to fully adapt to all screens including their orientations.
When used together with the <code>rem</code> unit, we can make sizing in CSS much easier.</p></main></div></div>]]>

<p>#Davos2021 starts today.</p>
<p>We’ve all been hearing a lot The Great Reset lately, new slogans abound such as Build Back Better, the New Normal, and what seems to be a “new” model called “Stakeholder Capitalism” is being espoused (although it is not new, I wrote about the pendulum swinging from stakeholder supremacy to shareholder supremacy back in the days of Milton Friedman in the <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/the-transition-overview-building-companies-that-matter/">inaugural post</a> for this site).</p>
<p>Recently I decided it would be helpful challenge my own reflexive inclination to suspect that we were all being collectively screwed by our institutions, yet again.&nbsp; I wondered if these momentous shifts were simply one of those tectonic phase shifts that occur throughout history and that I shouldn’t leap to the conclusion that it’s some disingenuous and ultimately malevolent&nbsp; pseudo-reality being imposed from above.</p>

<p>It is fitting that on this&nbsp; first day of #Davos2021 I outline my arc in which I tried to suspend disbelief around The Great Reset narrative, forcing myself to pose the question:</p>
<h3>What if The Great Reset was getting a bad rap?</h3>
<p>Maybe it’s true that the world has changed irrevocably, <em>and</em> that change hasn’t been driven or captured by a razor thin scab of elites at the top of the socio-economic pyramid who are setting the agenda. The idea of a reset may be well founded, after all when I first started writing about wealth inequality and crony capitalism over a decade ago, I called it <a href="https://rebootingcapitalism.com/">“Rebooting Capitalism”.</a></p>
<p>So I started going through Klaus Schwab’s books: <strong>The Fourth Industrial Revolution</strong> (2016), <strong>COVID-19: The Great Reset </strong>(2020) and most recently, <strong>Stakeholder Capitalism. </strong>(2021)<strong>. </strong>&nbsp;It started out as s a curious blend of nodding one’s head in agreement, underlining numerous passages, musing that maybe this is just descriptive, not prescriptive. By that I mean, maybe Schwab is simply trying to make sense of the shifts occurring, and not really offering frameworks around what&nbsp;<em>should</em> happen next, but just trying to parse what is happening and possible trajectories of the future.</p>
<p>This former case is similar to Warren Mosler’s description of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). It describes how Mosler and other MMT-ers think the system actually works and why the outcomes will not be as conventional economics generally fears. In Stephenie Kelton’s more recent book <strong>The Deficit Myth</strong>, she builds on this theme that MMT is more descriptive with some prescriptive policy <em>recommendations. </em>But my overall sense of it is that these books about MMT were more about trying to articulate a new way of looking at the existing system and not trying to drive a completely overriding agenda (even if that’s what would happen if policy makers <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/the-disturbing-rise-of-modern-monetary-theory-mmt/">seize on MMT as a rationalization</a> for destroying their currencies).</p>
<p>I mention MMT here specifically because we touch on it again when I contrast it to Charles Hugh Smith’s concept of Community Labour Integrated Money Economy (CLIME), a little later.</p>
<p>With Schwab, he spends a lot of time in a descriptive mode, talking about the what is happening in the world, although we do see some of his assumptions creeping in and for awhile, I am cautiously optimistic that if everything Schwab outlines as a&nbsp;<em>policy&nbsp;</em>response to global issues like global poverty, and of course now, the pandemic, maybe it’s just the way of the world and this is the direction things are going without there necessarily being a SPECTRE-like entity in the WEF driving a self-serving agenda.</p>
<p>When Schwab talks about how a grand ideal of a standard issue One World Government model, what he calls the Neoliberal Utopia simply will not work, I breathe a sigh of relief,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Consider&nbsp; a global government [that] regulates multinational companies in global markets, and people gather in a global democracy and global unions. It is an unrealistic an undesirable goal, as it increases the distance between individuals and the immediate social ecosystems they are a part of. It also decreases their feeling of commitment to the people and the environment closest to them…Though the 20th century neoliberalists once may have seen such a global model as a Utopian ideal, it would inevitably end in the political disenfranchisement of local communities. When the center of power is too far removed&nbsp; from people’s everyday realities, neither political governance nor economic decision-making would have popular support.”<br>
— Stakeholder Capitalism p.181</p></blockquote>

<p>But then, the more I read, the more I couldn’t shake the sense that when a guy like Schwab means by the word “commitment, what he really means is “obedience”. Schwab understands that people aren’t really going to accept decisions from on high, especially if on high is a centralized world government.</p>
<h2>What we really need is “Subsidiarity”</h2>
<p>Schwab goes on to introduce with a flourish one of the core pillars of Stakeholder Capitalism: <strong>Subsidiarity&nbsp;</strong>(the other is “Value creation and sharing”):</p>
<blockquote><p>A primary principle for the implementation of Stakeholder Capitalism is therefore that of&nbsp;<strong><em>subsidiarity.&nbsp;</em></strong>It is not an untested or purely theoretical principal. Applied most famously in the governance of the European Union..it asserts that decisions should be taken at the most granular level possible, closest to where they will have the most noticeable effects. It determines, in other words, that local stakeholders should be able to decide for themselves, <strong>except when it is not feasible or effective for them to do so.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Subsidiarity is&nbsp;<em>supposed</em> to mean “whatever can be done at lower levels of government should not be done at higher levels”, but my guess is the devil would be in the details. Like in that last sentence of the quote, when it is not feasible or effective for the “stakeholders” in Stakeholder Capitalism to decide certain matters for themselves, those will have to be decided for them.</p>
<p>What would those sorts of issues be?</p>
<p>Well for starters, there’s climate change. That’s one of the things that’s already been decided…</p>
<blockquote><p>“It makes sense to coordinate this challenge first at the global level.” but then the second level is at the national level, where countries can take different approaches, <em>a limit on auto travel would have significant effect in the United States</em>, where cars are the primary mode of transportation. Taking a different approach, such as <em>limiting air travel</em>, would affect certain groups of people more than others. Subsidiarity supports a national or local level of decision making for countries to determine which path will work best for them to effectively address the global goal”.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Schwab blithely bandies about various limitations and curtailments on everybody else’s range of motion and economic choices, there is never any treatment of climate change as anything&nbsp;<em>but </em> a global crisis that justifies the complete re-ordering of everybody’s lives.</p>
<p>And yet, the same level of drastic re-ordering of everybody else’s lives is proffered in Schwab’s other book, COVID-19: The Great Reset, even though by his own admission in that same book, COVID-19 is a not civilization ending plague:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Even in the worst-case horrendous scenario, COVID-19 will kill far fewer people than the Great Plagues, including the Black Deaths, or World War II did”<br>
— COVID-19: The Great Reset p. 17</p></blockquote>
<p>Albeit one that provides an excellent opportunity to reorder everybody else’s lives,</p>
<blockquote><p>changes that would have seemed inconceivable before the pandemic struck, such as new forms of monetary policy like helicopter money (already a given), the reconsideration/recalibration of some of our social priorities and augmented search for the common good as a policy objective, the notion of fairness acquiring political potency,&nbsp;<strong>radical welfare and taxation measures</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>drastic geopolitical realignments</strong>.</p>
<p>The broader point is this: the possibilities for change and the resulting new order are now unlimited and only bound by our imagination, for better or for worse. Societies could be poised to become either more egalitarian or more authoritarian, or geared towards more solidarity or more individualism, favouring the interests of the few or the many…</p></blockquote>
<p>You get the point: <strong><em>we (as in the WEF)</em>&nbsp;should take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine <em>your</em> world</strong>.</p>
<p>If COVID-19 is a comparatively lightweight pandemic to be opportunistically seized upon to drastically reorder everybody’s lives, one cant help but wonder if the climate “crisis” isn’t yet another global softball. Perhaps in the cold light of day, it could turn out that climate change is either out of our hands (if it is driven largely or even partially <a href="https://www.livescience.com/61716-sun-cooling-global-warming.html">by solar cycles</a>) or that climate alarmism is in itself more toxic and destructive than the direct effects of climate change itself, as Michael Shellenberger asserts in <strong>“Apocalypse Never”</strong>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apocalypse Never explores how and why so many of us came to see important but manageable environmental problems as the end of the world, and why the people who are the most apocalyptic about environmental problems tend to oppose the best and most obvious solutions to solving them.</p>
<p>Shellenberger, Michael. Apocalypse Never (p. xi). Harper. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shouldn’t there be some sort of process or governance structure in there to protect the world’s citizens from being overly regulated by somebody else’s idea of what is important? Should there be some counterbalance to these unilateral assessments of when drastic measures are required, especially when those measures would supersede our own agency in directing&nbsp; our own lives?</p>
<p>But there isn’t, not in Schwab’s Stakeholder Capitalism after the The Great Reset.</p>
<p>What we get instead is “subsidiarity”:</p>
<p>Another example around climate change, conspicuous in its lack of coverage in Schwab’s books is the idea of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>If the entire world is headed toward an eventual transition off of fossil fuels (if for no other reason than Peak Oil) then shouldn’t the safest, cleanest, efficient energy source be featured prominently? The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/x-energy-developing-pebble-bed-reactor-they-say-cant-melt-down">next generation pebble bed reactors</a> and …</p></section></div>

<p>We often get customers&nbsp;ringing for quotes and being surprised (and sometimes shocked) at the prices we charge. We will get comments along the lines of <em>“So-and-so can do that airport trip for £35. <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">You’re charging £50</a>”</em>.</p>



<p>That is perfectly true. There will <em>always</em> be someone who can do the job at a lower price than Hart Taxis can. We do not compete on price.</p>


<div id="attachment_1405"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1405" loading="lazy" src="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png" alt="Best Taxi service in Fleet, Yateley, Hartley Wintney" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png 300w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-250x250.png 250w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1405">Hart Taxis won the ‘Best Taxi Service in Fleet’ award for two years running.</p></div>
<p>The fact of the matter is that there is a set minimum cost to doing business in the taxi trade. This cost includes such items as hourly rates for drivers, servicing costs for vehicles, insurance, licence fees etc.</p>
<p>Some of these fees are non-negotiable: You have to have insurance and you have to have a hackney carriage licence.&nbsp;Other costs are more malleable. For example rather than trying to let a driver earn a living wage by working a maximum 12 hour shift you can cut the amount you pay a driver and force him to work 14 to 18 hours per day for 7 days per week to earn enough. There is an obvious impact on driver safety when this happens.</p>
<p>The other way is to cut down on the servicing for your vehicles. At a recent snap examination in the small hours of the morning the police and the VOSN stopped a number of taxis in Fleet and found that several of them were running vehicles with questionable service records. One of our competitor’s vehicles&nbsp;was found to have four bald tyres and was immediately impounded by the police as being unsafe to drive on the road. All Hart Taxis vehicles passed with flying colours.</p>
<p>The next time you book a vehicle which is ‘cheap’ bear in mind that the driver <em>may</em> have been working 14 or 15 hours when he gets to you and <em>may</em> be running a vehicle which is barely road legal. Both of these factors put you, the passenger, at risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I work in the haulage&nbsp;business and understand the issues facing drivers working long hours. I’m happy to pay the rates Hart Taxis charge if it means my taxi will be on time, with a driver who is awake and ready to drive in a road-safe vehicle – A Hart Taxis customer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore there are some taxis who will cut costs by not providing a good service. This may be by promising to arrive at a certain time but then regularly turning up late. Sometimes late enough for you to miss your flight or your train at the station. They may arrive looking scruffy, unshaven or badly dressed. They may take you on a longer route than you expected and <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/2018/04/know-the-full-fare-before-you-get-in-the-vehicle/">hike the fares up that way</a>. Or there may be additional hidden fees added to your fare when you arrive. A good example of this is those companies that <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">charge a low fare for an airport pick-up</a> but then hit you with parking fees and waiting time – especially if your plane arrives late.</p>
<p>Let me be clear; I am not saying that <em>all</em> our cheaper competitors are running their drivers ragged with dirty, unsafe vehicles, lying to customers about when they are going to arrive and causing them to miss their planes and trains. But I am saying that every single one of those behaviours has been reported for one or more of the taxi companies working in the Hart district. All of the companies who have had these behaviours reported about them charge less than Hart Taxis for their services.</p>
<p>With Hart Taxis you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart drivers who have been working a maximum of 12 hours in a single shift and a maximum of 6 shifts per week.</li>
<li>Smart, washed and valeted cars</li>
<li>Road legal vehicles with full service history.</li>
<li>Vehicle tracking services so you can see where your driver is from when they accept your job to when they arrive.</li>
<li>Text information detailing the make, colour and registration of the vehicle that will be picking you up.</li>
<li>Meet and greet service at the airport where we monitor your incoming flight and only send the driver at the appropriate time.</li>
<li>Bottled water on arrival at our airport jobs.</li>
<li>Automated booking via our <a href="https://harttaxis.com/meet-oliviar">Oliviar</a> booking system with the industry’s leading <a href="http://cordic.com/">booking and despatch software</a></li>
<li>Full E-receipt provided on completion of job, if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>This service is something which Hart Taxis are proud&nbsp;to offer. But in order to offer this we expect our drivers to be paid an appropriate amount of money.</p>
<p>That is why Hart Taxis are considered by our customers to provide excellent value for money despite being more expensive than others. If you are price sensitive then please let us know and we will happily give you the contact details for our competitors. They may well be cheaper – but at what cost?</p>
<p>Please feel free to check out our <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/testimonials-2/">testimonials page</a> if you want more feedback about our service. We think you’ll feel that the higher price is worth it.</p></div></div>]]>

We seem to be able to wrap our heads around how to <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/07/20/limit-setting-grabbing/">respectfully set limits</a>, <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/07/04/choices-part-1-of-3-why-when/">offer choices</a>, acknowledge their feelings, understand the <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/06/22/consequences-how-we-misuse-them/">differences between natural and logical consequences</a>, even calmly support them through tantrums. But when push comes to shove, there is one thing that stumps us:</p>
<p>“What do I do when they simply refuse to do what I am asking them to do?”</p>
<p>I would reword the question, actually.&nbsp; Don’t get me wrong, I hear you.&nbsp; You’re asking what to do when your kids refuse to pick up their toys, put their clothes on, brush their teeth, clean up a mess they made.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; i would still reword it.&nbsp; I hear the words that you are asking.&nbsp; And after they go through the filter that is oh-so-handily inside my ears, the question looks a lot more like:</p>
<p>“What do I do wh<img data-attachment-id="2056" data-permalink="https://visiblechild.com/2015/09/02/model-graciousness/tickertape/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=880%2C865&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="880,865" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="tickertape" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=640%2C629&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?resize=150%2C147&amp;ssl=1" alt="tickertape" width="150" height="147" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?resize=150%2C147&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">en I’m not in control?”</p>
<p>That’s right.&nbsp; Control.&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re all a little obsessed with control, in my opinion.&nbsp; It’s one of those things that falls solidly in the “should” or “have to” category.&nbsp; It’s the lever on the ticker tape machine (oops, I think I’m dating myself–pic over there, just in case) that rolls out endless tape that reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I don’t make them do it, I’m a pushover,”</p>
<p>“She HAS to.&nbsp; I’m the parent, I have to make her do it,”</p>
<p>“It’s my JOB to teach her.&nbsp; She may be stubborn, but I can outlast her.”</p>
<p>“My life is going to be hell if I don’t insist that they do it.&nbsp; They’ll walk all over me.”</p>
<p>“I am NOT going to have one of those entitled kids who expect their parents to do everything for them.”</p>
<p>“They have to learn responsibility and that actions have consequences!”</p>
<p>“I have to make it clear that I’m in charge. It’s non-negotiable.&nbsp; I’ll sit here until they do it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>What did you think and feel as you read those examples? My guess is that most of you felt some version of “That’s RIGHT!” And you would find a lot of support for that.&nbsp; Yes, even among “gentle” or “respectful” parents and bloggers.&nbsp; Ironically, I’ve found more rigidity among these communities than I might have expected.&nbsp; To me, it looks like a reaction to being seen as “permissive.”&nbsp; We want people to be sure to know that just because we’re respectful or gentle, we <strong><em>aren’t</em></strong> permissive, so we talk a lot about how to get kids to do things, because if we’re tough (and yet still kind), it proves that we’re not the doormats that people make us out to be.</p>
<p>I don’t buy it.</p>
<p>So once again, I find myself in a position of seeing things a bit differently (yeah, it’s my destiny.)&nbsp; You know what I think and feel as I read those examples up there?&nbsp; I think that they all sound a bit like we’re dealing with the enemy.&nbsp; They’re adversarial.&nbsp; I’m right, they’re wrong.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; They’re just stubborn.&nbsp; I have to break them.&nbsp; I’m The Parent.</p>
<p>Yup.&nbsp; Control.</p>
<p>And fear.&nbsp; Let’s not forget about fear.&nbsp; Fear that we’ll be ineffectual.&nbsp; Fear that our children will grow up to be entitled.&nbsp; Fear that our friends and relatives who think we’re those kooky people who do that “gentle discipline stuff” will laugh and shake their heads at us, either in our presence or behind our backs, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or worse yet, they’ll “tsk” at us, as if to say “Well, if you were more in charge, your kids would have better manners.”&nbsp; Lots of fear in parenting.&nbsp; Yup.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, I don’t think we don’t have to have that sort of relationship with our children. I know we think we do.&nbsp; But we don’t.&nbsp; It’s a choice.&nbsp; It’s not a non-negotiable.&nbsp; There <em>are</em> other ways.&nbsp; So let’s talk about just one of them.&nbsp; And no, it does NOT lead to children who walk all over you.</p>
<p>Now, before you think I’ve gone completely loony tunes (or–gasp–that I <em>am</em> in favor of permissiveness, which I assure you that I am not), let me say that yes, I do know and accept that our role as parents is to “teach” responsibility, values, helpfulness, manners, self-care, independence, routines, cause and effect, blah blah blah.&nbsp; The problem–and it<em> is</em> a problem–is that these are things that can’t be taught.&nbsp; Well, okay, they can be taught.&nbsp; It’s true, you can make your kid do anything. But the things that you “teach” don’t stick.&nbsp; Not in the way that I want them to at least.</p>
<p>Children do not learn from what we say.&nbsp; They don’t even learn from what we do.&nbsp; <strong>They learn from who we are.&nbsp; And they’re always watching.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I choose to model graciousness.</p>
<p>Now before we go any further, let me just say that, although I have used this strategy for as long as I can remember–first with the children I worked with and then with my own child–I did not come up with this nifty difty little name.&nbsp; I owe that to a wonderful woman from New Zealand, an unschooling mom that I met online in several RIE discussion groups.&nbsp; Whenever this topic would come up, she would be a lone voice.&nbsp; Amid the fifty or sixty comments in which parents gave one another tip after tip about how to get-the-kid-to-do-the-thing, suddenly her name would appear, and next to it, it would say two words:&nbsp; Model Graciousness.&nbsp; There it was.&nbsp; In two words.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; (<em>Thank you, L.</em>)</p>
<p>So this is my answer (now that I have a name for it and all.)&nbsp; Model graciousness.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>It means that you demonstrate and model for them the authentic spirit and intention that you wish for them to possess.&nbsp; If you want them to be generous, be generous (yes, of spirit, not just with “things.”)&nbsp; If you want them to be helpful, be helpful.&nbsp; If you want them to help without being asked, help without being asked.&nbsp; If you want them to speak softly, speak softly.&nbsp; If you want them to say thank you, say thank you.&nbsp; Always without resentment—because I presume that you don’t want children who resent you.&nbsp; You get the idea.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you “what now.”&nbsp; Model graciousness.&nbsp; Clean it up.&nbsp; Say, with confidence (and feel with confidence, too…that matters) that you’re happy to help this time and that you’re sure she will help next time.&nbsp; Because you <em>are</em> sure that she’ll help next time (right??)&nbsp; And if it turns out that you’re wrong, and she <em>doesn’t</em> help next time, still have confidence that she will do it the next time (and chalk it up to developmental stage or fatigue or teething or a long day at school or that toy that broke earlier in the day.)&nbsp; Quiet the anxious voices in your head that say “<em>if i clean it up,</em> <em>she’ll never learn responsibility</em>.”&nbsp; Quiet the resentful voices in your head that say <em>“I’m sick of doing everything for her when she’s perfectly capable of doing it herself.</em>” Quiet the punitive voices in your head that say “<em>she spilled it, she needs to clean it up.”</em> &nbsp; Have trust that she will do it next time.&nbsp; Because one of these times, she will.&nbsp; <strong>She will be like you.&nbsp; Helpful.&nbsp; Generous.&nbsp; Altruistic.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I would give another example, but it works pretty much the same way no matter what the example is.&nbsp; You know that expression “Be the change you wish to see in the world?”&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; This is that, parenting style.</p>
<p>You want to know why.&nbsp; I know you want to know why.&nbsp; So I’m going to put it as simply as I possibly can:&nbsp; <strong>“I didn’t do it.”</strong></p>
<p>I know that all of us have heard this,&nbsp; whether as a child ourselves, as a teacher, as a parent, among extended family, or at the park.&nbsp; A parent or a teacher or an older child asks (tells?) children to clean something up.&nbsp; They say “I didn’t do it”&nbsp; or “It’s not my mess” or “<em>You</em> clean it up” or “I wasn’t working over there.”</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but for me, this phrase is like fingernails on a chalkboard.&nbsp; It is the epitome of everything that I do not want my child to be.&nbsp; I want to raise a child who is prosocial, generous, altruistic, empathic.&nbsp; I want my child to be the one the teacher sends an email about because she was the only one who didn’t laugh when another child’s experiment blew up in science class, and the only one who went over and helped him clean it up without being asked.&nbsp; I never want to hear the words “it’s not my mess” come out of my child’s mouth when she is asked to help clean up–by me or anyone else. I want her to smile and say “Sure.”&nbsp; And I don’t only want her to help–I want her to help without resentment of any sort. (is it a pipe dream?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It isn’t.)&nbsp; This is what altruism <em>is.</em>&nbsp; I hold it sacred.</p>
<p>If I want <em>her</em> to do that and be that person, then<em> I</em> have to do that and be that person.&nbsp; Help without resentment.&nbsp; Accept others’ emotional or developmental limitations, either in general or in the moment.&nbsp; …</p></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map database</a> contains detailed information about almost every square metre of the surface of the planet. Land use, building types, rivers, park benches, pubs, streets and millions of other data points are all mapped out and documented in detail.</p>



<div><p>You might be familiar with the browser-based <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map (OSM) website</a>. Superficially it resembles mapping services like Google or Bing, but you may not be aware that the huge mapping dataset that powers it can also be accessed directly. Need to find all the power lines in a city? Count the number of pubs per square kilometre? Visualise COVID cases region by region? Or maybe you just want to solve a <a href="https://quiztime.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://quiztime.com">Quiztime</a> puzzle? OSM’s vast database can be queried to support almost any mapping use case you can think of.</p><p>The OSM database can be queried via an API called <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass</a>. It’s very powerful but it isn’t very beginner friendly and constructing queries requires a little coding knowledge. </p></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1030" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-2048x1030.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-2048x1030.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-300x151.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-768x386.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-1536x773.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure></div>



<p>A more accessible way to access Overpass exists in the form of <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/">Overpass Turbo</a>. Overpass Turbo allows you to build Overpass queries in a much more user friendly way. You can build the query, run it, and then see the data represented on the map. The results can also be returned in a CSV or JSON format, which makes incorporating them into your own mapping projects much easier.</p>



<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>



<p>Although Overpass Turbo is more user friendly than querying Overpass directly, it is nothing like as easy to use as Google Maps for example. It is much more powerful than Google Maps, but constructing effective queries requires an understanding of the data types that OSM contains. </p>



<div><p>The syntax is also much stricter. If you enter “five star hotel near Disneyland” as your Overpass Turbo query, you won’t get very far.</p><p>It’s worth spending a short time getting familiar with the basic types of OSM data before starting to build queries. </p></div>



<h3>Geometries</h3>



<p>There are three main types of object in the OSM database. These are known as geometries. Every object represented on an OSM map is one of these types.</p>



<h3>Node</h3>



<p>A node is a single point on a map. It has a unique ID number and a set of coordinates. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279542#map=17/52.28932/8.03031" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279542#map=17/52.28932/8.03031">This park bench</a> next to a canal in the city of Osnabrück is a single node:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1858" height="1440" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42.png 1858w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-300x233.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-768x595.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-1536x1190.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1858px) 100vw, 1858px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see it has a unique ID number, lat/long coordinates, and some tags that describe its properties. We’ll discuss tags shortly.</p>



<h3>Way</h3>



<p>Next to the bench is a railway line. Linear features cannot be represented by a single node on a map, so paths, roads, rivers and motorways are represented by multiple nodes linked together to form a way. A way is just a collection of linked nodes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="884" height="882" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52.png 884w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-300x300.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-150x150.png 150w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-768x766.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px"></figure></div>



<p>Ways do not just have to be linear like railways or canals. A collection of nodes can start and end on the same point to form a shape. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/94423432">This airfield</a> just outside Osnabrück is not a node, but a way. Its boundary is defined by a series of single nodes linked together to form a polygon:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1058" height="674" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04.png 1058w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04-300x191.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04-768x489.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1058px) 100vw, 1058px"></figure></div>



<p>So to find objects that are greater than a single point on a map, it is necessary to search for ways and not just nodes. We will see shortly that there is a way to combine these kinds of query, but we need to look at the final data type first.</p>



<h3>Relation</h3>



<p>A node is a single point. A way is a series of linked nodes. A relation combines ways and nodes to form more complex objects. </p>



<p>Let’s say that you want to represent a train route in OSM. You have nodes (stations, signals) and ways (track sections, bridges, perhaps larger stations). To represent the route would require combining these nodes and ways into a single “route” object. These kind of combinations are known as “relations”.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to Osnabrück. The Hafen area is an administrative district in the north of the city. In OSM it is a collection of ways that mark the geographic boundary and also a single node denoting it is an administrative centre. It is too complex an object to be either just a way or just a node, so the nodes and ways are combined to form a relation.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1168" height="1178" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40.png 1168w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-297x300.png 297w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-150x150.png 150w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-768x775.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px"></figure></div>



<p>Multiple ways form the boundary. The single node in the middle refers to the administrative centre. This can be seen in the info panel in OSM (right click on the map and click “query features”):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="658" height="438" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53.png 658w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></figure></div>



<p>The Hafen area is a <em>relation</em> made up of 5 <em>ways</em> and a single <em>node</em>.</p>



<h3>Tags</h3>



<p>Tags are the key to finding information in OSM. As we’ve just seen, every object in OSM is either a node, way, or a relation. These objects contain location data but they do not contain descriptive information. Nodes, ways and objects are labelled and described with a series of Tags. </p>



<p>The first object we looked at was a <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279543">park bench</a>. It’s a node with a unique reference number of 4340279543 and lat/long coordinates of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/52.2910290/8.0265765">52.2910290, 8.0265765</a>. That is all the information a node needs to exist – but how could anyone ever find it or even know what it was based on those details alone? </p>



<p>OSM objects need additional information in order for them to be described and indexed properly. Tags are used to do this. The bench has several tags to describe it:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="658" height="438" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49.png 658w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></figure></div>



<p>This is a very powerful system, but there is one difficulty with tags. In Overpass Turbo I cannot just do a freetext search like “park bench” and be certain that I will find a matching tag. The tags I use to search have to match exactly with the tags as they were assigned by OSM contributors, so if I just guess the tag name I will probably be wrong and I won’t find what I’m looking for. Overpass Turbo’s Query Wizard can help slightly by suggesting tags based on search terms, but it pays to know how tags are constructed in order to be as accurate as possible with your results.</p>



<h3>TagInfo</h3>



<p>OSM’s <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/">Taginfo site </a>allows you to search for tags that have already been added to the database. Using the search box in the top right we can search for the keys and values that make up tags so they can be added to our queries.</p>



<p>Let’s say that I want to find wind turbines. I enter the term “wind turbine” into the Taginfo search box and get <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/search?q=wind+turbine#keys">these results</a>. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57.png" alt="" width="722" height="391" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57.png 1812w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-300x163.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-768x417.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-1536x834.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></figure></div>



<p>OSM Tags are always made up of a key-value pair. You can think of keys as a main type, and values as a subtype. Examples of common key-value pairs might be <code data-enlighter-language="raw">building=school,</code> or <code data-enlighter-language="raw">highway=motorway.</code> </p>



<p>This means that just creating a tag called “wind turbine” won’t work in OSM. The tag must have both a key <em>and</em> a value.</p>



<p>The image above shows how people have created key-value pairs to describe wind turbines. By far the most popular is the tag <code data-enlighter-language="md">generator:method = wind_turbine</code>. </p>



<p>You can see the tag is comprised of the key <code data-enlighter-language="generic">generator:method</code> and the value <code data-enlighter-language="generic">wind_turbine.</code> You can also see that there are 240,052 objects in the OSM database that are tagged this way, so to find a wind turbine this will be the best tag to use. By contrast if I searched with the tag <code data-enlighter-language="generic">name = Wind turbine</code> this would only match 18 objects in the entire database, so I’m unlikely to find what I’m looking for.</p>



<p>Here are all the results for the <code>generator:method = wind_turbine</code> query in Osnabrück:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="421" height="475" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12.png 421w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px"></figure></div>



<h3>Bounding Boxes</h3>



<p>Before putting these concepts into action it’s important to mention the concept of bounding boxes. When querying Overpass it is necesary to set a North, South, East and West boundary point of the box you wish to search in. These are normally defined with coordinates sent to the API, but fortunately Overpass Turbo creates this box for you based on the map area in view in the right hand window. The coordinates are represented by the <code data-enlighter-language="generic">{{bbox}}</code> tag in the query code. Overpass Turbo will only search for data matches within the box area you specify.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>In this post we’ve looked at the basic building blocks of OSM and Overpass Turbo. In the next post we’ll put them together to build some queries and start retrieving data.</p>

<article>
  <p>My <a href="https://diyrobocars.com/">DIYRobocars</a> autonomous RC car has come a long
way since my <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2018/11/13/fast-line-following.html">last post</a> on the subject.
I want to highlight a localization algorithm I came up with which works really
well, at least in this specific setting. I’ve been using it in races for a
while and it really stepped up the speeds I was able to achieve without the car
getting “lost” – about 22mph on the front straight of this small track. It
makes use of a fisheye camera looking towards the ceiling, and a localization
update runs in about 1ms at 640x480 on a Raspberry Pi 3, with precision on the
order of a few centimeters.</p>

<p>Here is a recent race against <a href="https://twitter.com/SmallPixelCar">another car</a>
which is about as fast, except it uses LIDAR to localize using the traffic
cones as landmarks. (My car previously localized using the cones as well,
except using a monocular camera, but the ceiling lights are much better when we
have them. Cone-based localization deserves a blog post of its own.) It’s a
three lap head-to-head race where there’s an extra random cone on the track. We
haven’t developed passing strategies yet though, so there are frequent racing
incidents…</p>

<p><em>DIYRobocars race on March 7, 2020. We had a little accident but my car (blue)
somehow made it through unscathed… I finished my three laps just to record a
time for that heat.</em></p>

<p>I put a fisheye lens Raspberry Pi camera out the front windshield of a 1/10
scale touring car. It’s mounted sideways because it has a wider field of view
horizontally, and I wanted more pixels looking towards the front so I could see
a bit of the ground ahead. (Full hardware details are on <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/">the github
repo</a>.) Here is what it looks like without
the lid:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/cycloid_hw.jpg" alt="RC car hardware"></p>

<p>I record telemetry and video in each race, which I can then replay through a
<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a>-based tool:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgfW2d5h_GI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In the lower-right corner of the video is a virtual view of the car’s position
and speed, entirely derived from the ceiling light localization algorithm.</p>

<p>With the fisheye lens, it can see a <em>lot</em> of ceiling lights from any point on
the track, and they’re all set up in a regular grid with one or two exceptions.
The algorithm is robust to extra lights being added, lights being burned out,
and other cars flying over the top of the camera (watch closely at 0:07),
without losing tracking.</p>

<p>Since it’s hard to tell what’s going on from the raw, sideways fisheye camera,
the tool has an option to use <code>cv2.undistort</code> and remap the image as if it were
looking straight out the front windshield:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FvOCsjPew8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>To make this practical at high FPS on a Raspberry Pi, I chose to make some
simplifying assumptions: assume all the ceiling lights are point sources on a
perfectly even grid, and that the camera moves along the floor at a fixed
height. This turned out to be good enough to work in practice. The method
doesn’t necessarily require an even grid, it just needs to be able to determine
the distance to the nearest landmark from any point. In a grid, that’s trivial,
but it’s not hard to use a map of the ceiling layout instead.</p>

<p>I also assumed I knew the grid size ahead of time, since I can just measure the
ceiling tile sizes and count the spaces between lights, and also measure the
height of the ceiling from the camera.</p>

<p>Further, the setting allows us to initialize the algorithm approximately at a
known location, namely the starting line. If the pattern of lights is perfectly
regular, there’s no way to tell which grid cell you started in, so we have to
assume we’re at the one containing the start of the race when we reset our
state.</p>


<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/ceiltrack-undistort.jpg" alt="undistorting fisheye"></p>

<p>The first step is to deal with the lens distortion. This is particularly
obvious when using a fisheye lens, but every lens should be calibrated. OpenCV
provides <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d58/group__calib3d__fisheye.html">a
module</a> for
calibrating converting from distorted/undistorted fisheye coordinates.</p>

<p>I won’t go too much into camera calibration here, but what I do is print <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/blob/master/tools/camcal/calboard.png">this
ArUco calibration
target</a>,
take still photos of it from several angles, and use <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/blob/master/tools/camcal/cal.py">this
script</a> to
get the camera intrinsic parameters.</p>

<p>With those parameters, you can use several OpenCV utilities to do things like
undistort images (shown above) or compute ideal pinhole camera ray vectors from
each pixel with <code>cv2.undistortPoints</code>.</p>

<p>In my tracking code, the initialization step computes a lookup table with the
supplied camera parameters. For each pixel, the lookup table has a \(\left[x,
y, 1\right]\) vector which forms a ray in 3D space starting at the camera and
heading out towards the ceiling. There is also a circular mask to filter out
pixels pointing too far away from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Note that the tracking code does <em>not</em> use <code>cv2.undistortImage</code> or equivalent.
The illustration above shows what undistorting the whole image does: objects
far away from the camera with relatively small numbers of pixels in the source
image take up a large number of blurry pixels in the output, and the objects
directly in front taking up most of the image are a small portion of the
output. What I want to do is give equal weight to each pixel in the source
image, and less weight to potential outliers. That way, the lights directly
above the camera are mostly what it will try to track on, which gives better
accuracy.</p>

<p>Once the lookup table is available, the problem reduces to matching a 2D grid
to all the corrected pixel locations for all pixels within the mask which look
like ceiling lights, meaning the grayscale pixel is brighter than some
threshold. The mask is necessary to deal with reflections from the car’s body
and light from nearby windows – it makes sure we’re only looking upwards for
ceiling lights.</p>



<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/ceiltrack-iteration.png" alt="aligning a grid to ceiling lights"><br>
<em>Grid alignment objective. Blue dots: initial uninitialized configuration \([u,
v, \theta] = (0, 0, 0)\); orange dots: fit after five iterations of
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm described below. Left: the grid dots are
transformed back into the fisheye distortion here to show the fit on the
original image. Right: the fit in undistorted space.</em></p>

<p>We can solve this with the same hammer we pound on all the other nails with in
computer vision: nonlinear least squares via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm">Levenberg-Marquardt</a>,
which is a fancy name for the ordinary least squares algorithm with a
simple tweak to make sure it converges.</p>

<p>The vehicle state is defined as \([u, v, \theta]\) where \(u, v\) are the
position within the grid along the \(x\) and \(y\) axes respectively, and
\(\theta\) is the heading angle of the vehicle. We’ll also define \(x_{spc}\)
and \(y_{spc}\) as the grid spacing in each axis.</p>

<p>Conceptually, if we superimpose a grid with that spacing on the ceiling, rotate
it by \(-\theta\) around the center and then translate it by \([-u, -v]\), the
grid should line up with the pixels in our image which are above the “white”
threshold.</p>

<p>To do the optimization, we start with an initial guess for \([u, v, \theta\)]
and repeat two steps: First, find the nearest grid point to every transformed
white pixel, and then solve for an updated \([u, v, \theta]\) to minimize the
residuals. Solving for \([u, v, \theta]\) may cause some pixels to match
different grid points, so repeating the two steps a few times is usually
necessary, otherwise it would be solved in closed form. In practice, once the
algorithm is “synced up”, only two iterations are really necessary to keep up
with tracking.</p>

<p>Let’s define a residual for every undistorted white pixel \([x_i, y_i]\)
measuring the distance to the closest grid point \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\):</p>

\[\mathbf{r}_i = \begin{bmatrix}\cos{\theta} &amp; \sin{\theta}\\-\sin{\theta} &amp; \cos{\theta}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_i \\ y_i \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}u \\ v \end{bmatrix} -
\begin{bmatrix}g_{xi} \\ g_{yi} \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>This says: Rotate each pixel \([x_i, y_i]\) by the car’s heading angle
\(\theta\), subtract the car’s position \([u, v]\), and compare it to the grid
point we think it should be on \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\). We want to minimize the
sum of the squares of all residuals, \(\sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i}^\top \mathbf{r}_i\).</p>

<p>(Note: \([x_i, y_i]\) here are the pixels after undoing the camera transform /
distortion, so they are not pixel coordinates but rather normalized
coordinates. You can think of it as a ray shooting from the camera intersecting
a plane 1 unit in front of the camera; (1, 0) would thus be a ray 45-degree
angle to the right of center shooting out of the camera.)</p>

<p>If we’re fitting to a grid, then \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\) can be found simply by
taking the transformed point modulo the grid spacing \(x_{spc}, y_{spc}\). In
principle, any pattern of landmarks, not just grids, can be used here.</p>

<p>Here’s my Python prototype implementation that finds the nearest grid point:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>moddist</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>q</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>q</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>%</span><span>q</span> <span>-</span> <span>q</span><span>/</span><span>2</span>

<span>def</span> <span>nearest_grid</span><span>(</span><span>xi</span><span>,</span> <span>yi</span><span>,</span> <span>xspc</span><span>,</span> <span>yspc</span><span>):</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>gxi</span><span>,</span> <span>gyi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To do the least-squares minimization, we need to compute the Jacobian (a fancy
word for the derivative of a vector with respect to a vector) of the residuals,
which is simple enough. I used <a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> in a Jupyter

Excessive media attention also increased the loss in value. The losses were smaller when the firm disclosed the scandal itself.</p><p>Lots of prior research has found significant losses in company value as a result of corporate malfeasance. But the specific impact of sexual harassment scandals on company value had not yet been studied.

They downloaded all articles that documented corporate scandals involving the term “sexual harassment” or its synonyms. These included for example “sexual misconduct” or “indecent assault.”</p><p>This resulted in a data set of almost 15,000 articles. Many of these articles involved privately held firms, or articles where the term “sexual harassment” occurred in an irrelevant context. These articles were discarded. The researchers also discarded articles about companies that were facing bankruptcy around the time of the scandal (but for reasons unrelated to the scandal), and other confounding factors such as activist investors attempting to gain control of a company’s board.</p><h2>From consumer favorites to financial powerhouses</h2><p>The researchers ultimately wound up with a list of 199 sexual harassment scandals. These included many household names, such as Disney, Tesla, Amazon, Google, and <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-claims-72-accuracy-in-predicting-someones-political-orientation-based-on-a-single-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>. The list also included financial firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and popular media brands including The New York Times, Fox, and CBS.</p><p>About 78% of the scandals took place in the US, and another 18% in other English-speaking countries. The accuser was a female in 88% of the cases; 73% of cases had only one accuser. The data set included roughly equal numbers of physical and non-physical harassment cases. The accused personnel were CEOs (14%), other executives (26%), or non-executives (60%).</p><h2><strong>The economic costs of sexual harassment</strong> <strong>in numbers</strong></h2><p>The researchers found “a negative 1.5% cumulative abnormal return over the event day and the following trading day.” For the roughly 200 companies in their sample, that corresponded to an average impact of $450&nbsp;million.</p><p>In the long term, the companies hit by such a scandal recovered only about half of that lost market value. The long-term average was a 0.8% loss, worth on average about $250&nbsp;million.</p><h2><strong>Emergence of the #MeToo movement</strong></h2><p>The study also found the impact of sexual harassment scandals on company value was about the same both before and after the emergence of the #MeToo movement. The paper dates that mergence as October 5, 2017. That is the day that The New York Times published its first article about the systematic sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>In contrast, the number of sexual harassment scandals at public companies has quadrupled since the emergence of the #MeToo movement. About 45% of the cases in this data set took place after October 2017.</p><p>Furthermore, the study also found that the market impact was lower in countries with lower levels of gender equality.</p><h2><strong>What raises or lowers the</strong> <strong>economic costs of sexual harassment</strong>?</h2><p>The involvement of a CEO in the scandal was a consistent driver of negative returns, adding an additional 5% drop in company value. Similarly, more media attention also corresponded to greater losses.</p><p>On the other hand, instances where companies self-disclosed the misconduct before it was discovered by the media were punished considerably less by the market. The market reaction was also less severe in cases where the accused CEO left the firm, versus staying on.</p><p>The study found that these losses stem mostly from damage to the firm’s reputation and public sentiment, rather than the costs of penalties and compensation claims, or the costs associated with the loss of expensive personnel.</p><p>In terms of damage control, the authors found that “immediate attempts at reputational repair are associated with alleviated market responses.” In other words, “the reputational effect and impact on public sentiment is an important channel of impact on market value” for companies embroiled in such a scandal.</p><p>In sum, the authors conclude, “there is a highly significant negative market reaction to sexual harassment scandals that can wipe off enormous amounts of market value in a matter of days.”</p><p>And these findings should put to rest “any remaining contemplation among managers and investors about whether sexual harassment is a real business risk,” they write. “The impact is shown to be both real and economically significant.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“#MeToo: Sexual harassment and company value”<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Mads Borelli-Kjaer, Laurids Moehl Schack, and Ulf Nielsson<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-corporate-finance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Corporate Finance</a></em><br><strong>Publication date: </strong>January 6, 2021<br><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101875</a><br><strong>Photo:</strong> by&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/users/mohamed_hassan-5229782/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4499303">Mohamed Hassan</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4499303">Pixabay</a>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

of the world’s first fully electric commercial aircraft at YVR airport in Richmond, British Columbia on Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2019. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Ben Nelms/CBC)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>A Vancouver seaplane company says its retro-fitted all electric airplane is set to take to the skies for more test flights this year, as it pushes forward with its plans to make commercial air travel cheaper and greener.</p>  <p>"There's no wavering in our confidence and determination and interest in getting this done," said Harbour Air&nbsp;CEO Greg McDougall.</p>  <p>Founded by McDougall in 1982, Harbour Air uses small propeller planes to fly commercial flights between the Lower Mainland, Seattle, Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and Whistler.</p>  <p>In the last few years it has <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/world-s-first-all-electric-commercial-seaplane-set-for-takeoff-in-richmond-1.5378163" target="_blank">turned its attention to becoming a leader in green urban mobility</a>, which would do away with the need to burn fossil fuels for air travel.</p>  <p>In December 2019, McDougall flew one of Harbour Air's planes, a more than 60-year-old &nbsp;DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver float plane, which had been outfitted with a Seattle-based company's electric propulsion system, for three minutes over Richmond B.C.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div

over the Fraser River for three minutes today in its debut test flight.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:26</span></span></span></p>  <p>Harbour Air joined with Seattle-based company MagniX in early 2019 to design the e-plane's engine, which was powered by NASA-approved lithium-ion batteries that were also used on the International Space Station.</p>  <p>At the time, based on the success of that inaugural flight, McDougall had hoped to be using the plane to fly passengers on its routes, such as between downtown Vancouver and downtown Victoria, by the end of this year.</p>  <p>Now, that timeline has been pushed back at least one year due to the pandemic.</p>  <p>"It's progressing, not as quickly as we hoped due to COVID, but we are getting back on track with the testing program," said McDougall.</p>    <p>Harbour Air has to prove to Transport Canada that its e-plane is as safe as its other conventional planes to allow it to fly with passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says Ottawa has approved a new permit to allow the company to continue with test flights this year, which will be used to improve the plane and all its components.</p>  <h2>New batteries</h2>  <p>Despite the setback from the pandemic, the company stands to benefit from advances in battery technology.</p>  <p>It has partnered with a new company for a different battery that is lighter and provides more power than what was used a year ago.</p>  <p>Analysts of the sector say the success of companies like Harbour Air to fly all-electric in a commercially successful way is completely dependent upon the energy system.</p>  <p>"Technologically, the real challenge is to make the batteries lighter," said Werner Antweiler, a professor of economics at UBC's&nbsp;Sauder School of Business who studies the commercialization of novel technologies around mobility.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt=""

seaplane in late December 2019.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Harbour Air)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The problem with lithium batteries is they are heavy, which means the plane Harbour Air is using them on quickly meets its weight capacity even without passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says battery technology is advancing quickly and he expects them to be even lighter and more powerful, as his project gets closer to flying commercially.</p>  <p>Antweiler says Harbour Air is in the "sweet spot" in the industry as its flights are short, meaning battery technology as it stands today makes the project viable.</p>  <p>"That is an ideal application because the batteries won't get you any farther than that range," he said about the length of flights Harbour Air does.</p>  <p>Getting on an all-electric jetliner to fly across Canada, he says,&nbsp;is decades away.</p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

This is usually hit or miss, depending on how well informed the recruiter is <em>and</em> how interested they are in helping you. Another similar approach is to ask around for someone who recently interviewed at the same company. </p><p>At Interview Query, we decided to tackle this problem and formulate our own methods for understanding what would be asked on data science interviews without relying on anecdotes. We did this by applying data science to over <strong>10,000 interview experiences </strong>that we found online and in our internal submissions from data scientists. We then classified and mapped the interview experiences at each company into 9 different question topics and skills buckets.</p><p>Here’s a list of links to other popular companies and roles:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/facebook/data-scientist">Facebook Data Scientist Interview</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/facebook/data-engineer">Facebook Data Engineer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/facebook/research-scientist">Facebook Research Scientist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/amazon/business-intelligence-engineer">Amazon Business Intelligence Engineer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/amazon/business-analyst">Amazon Business Analyst</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/ibm/data-scientist">IBM Data Scientist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/google/data-scientist">Google Data Scientist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/Uber/data-scientist">Uber Data Scientist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/microsoft/data-scientist">Microsoft Data Scientist</a></li></ul><h3 id="building-the-interview-topics-graph">Building the Interview Topics Graph</h3><p>Our job at Interview Query is to make the interview process more transparent for aspiring data scientists and machine learning engineers. Our first task towards that goal was classifying data science interview questions into 8-10 different problem types, such as SQL and data analysis, probability and statistics, machine learning, and so on. </p><p>User feedback was great– we were adding structure to an obscure field that is always rapidly changing. </p><p>But it came to the point that most of our customers wanted even more insightful information about the specific roles that they were applying for. It didn’t make sense for candidates to study probability concepts if the interviewers were only going to ask questions on SQL. &nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, we realized that interview questions <strong>should reflect a job’s work on a day-to-day basis</strong>. Classifying different companies and positions then adds more transparency into the different kinds<em> </em>of data science positions, and allows anyone to assess if the job is the right fit for them! </p><p>For example, if we compare <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/amazon/data-scientist">Amazon’s</a> and <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/google/data-scientist">Google’s data science roles</a>, we can see that they test vastly different subjects. Amazon places a higher emphasis on machine learning and coding, while Google mostly cares about statistical analysis. </p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q8Ggsz5BEbdxvdhhOWFvKiobUYD4KJzb8f8aHMAAaaZqlBrrTkcUe5uC1sXl1TIiJAtPvy0KLJYfcjSZLr8bbax4g1IfaU5WSx7Kdf7EcfpJTP8ulEUe3Ty-NaLD88BCWCCl6VJl" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gwS4e5XqlspXsvnGM9lB9DLEz7I4247OL-RWxvXrqP3bZ6ZONXI-S_qr4tq2zCCPpem5ZZKGvMO-nOKBWnwDwS9mJn79dV0lViREFkUaUUdaYJk0kSZUSEptYHB3Bxf1lNkdcvKg" alt=""></figure><p>We built these charts by utilizing two techniques:</p><ol><li>Crowdsourcing information from our members.</li><li>Applying unsupervised learning techniques on interview experience text data online. </li></ol><p>The first technique was pretty simple. Given our audience of data science candidates, we periodically sent out surveys asking about interview experiences. We also put interview question submission forms on different parts of our website to encourage users to add questions they’ve seen before. </p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YrH0zXSIgJb1ZQCgO7POYGcq-OfYru2p7Q7IO6yfnO3kGt5YYgZ_l61kcN4wpmDeB2AVLdTU_7ha3lG5O8QI3XdFos2yjfQWH6Ne_0KPmXTHYnlzEm1JKIAi79W-SezQtlWlkYeh" alt=""></figure><blockquote><em>Get early access to our database of interview experiences and salaries by</em><a href="https://interviewquery.typeform.com/to/dY2ETnFz#"><em> adding your interview experience today!</em></a></blockquote><p>Crowdsourcing from our members had a tremendous effect. Just a simple aggregation on each question type was all that was necessary to understand the frequency of different questions. Additionally, we could segment question types by how far candidates got throughout each stage of the interview, adding some granularity into the question topics.</p><h3 id="unsupervised-learning-on-interview-text-data">Unsupervised Learning on Interview Text Data</h3><p>The second method we used was applying unsupervised learning on interview text data to classify the text into the different topics. Many times, online and within our own Slack community, members will post their interview experiences from different companies to share. <br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_IbhwOw9-zsWAEnek_hIlKGCeMsKn27zUXtD2SpGHTBB5NHu2xl6Hjey4o_yNofIgSsY4zLDjGcX5EiqY0g8rgzSU6stYs7xtAbnA8JQl2k-nOCrWkG0m1lltefUfHcajTwVW3tK" alt=""></figure><p>Given the string of text, as humans, we can clearly see that the member who interviewed at Convoy for a data scientist position was asked a behavioral question, a SQL question, a product intuition question, and a couple business case questions. But it’s rather difficult for a computer to process this kind of output from reading plain text. </p><p>Given we didn’t have any training dataset and labeling data was impractical in our case, the only way we …</p></div></section></div>

In
<a href="https://www.arun.is/blog/apple-watch">my review of the Apple Watch Series 6</a>, I described how it
sits at the confluence of design, technology, lifestyle, and watchmaking. This
perfect blend of so many different disciplines and constraints puts it in a
category all by itself.</p><p>Apple did this not by taking an age-old wristwatch silhouette and cramming some
electronics in it. Instead, they carefully reimagined every aspect, from the
user interaction patterns to the mechanism securing the interchangeable bands,
the digital crown, the variety of cases and bands, and the use of watch terms
like “complication” in the user experience.</p><p>In particular, the analog faces reveal what Apple does so well — taking the
familiar and making it their own. Over the years, they have released quite a few
faces with roots in history. Each one started as an iconic watch archetype and
was remade to take advantage of the Apple Watch platform.</p><h2 id="watch-terminology">Watch terminology</h2><p>Before jumping into the Apple Watch, let’s review some useful watch terminology.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/502880983?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><p>Some additional terms that were difficult to illustrate:</p><ol><li><strong>Case:</strong> The case is the enclosure that houses the watch internals and
around which everything else is attached.</li><li><strong>Movement:</strong> The movement is the heart of the watch. It is the mechanism in
charge of keeping time and running any complications.</li><li><strong>Subdial:</strong> Subdials are smaller dials within the main dial. They are often
used to track the seconds or power reserve.</li><li><strong>Complication:</strong> This term refers to any function aside from time-keeping,
such as the date, or moonphase.</li><li><strong>Crystal:</strong> The crystal is the clear material that protects the watch dial.
Crystals are usually made of plastic, mineral glass, or synthetic sapphire,
which has a hardness only topped by diamond.</li><li><strong>Reference number:</strong> Similar to model numbers in other products, the
reference number can be used to identify the model, material, dial,
movement, and more. Often, collectors use reference numbers instead of names
in order to be specific.</li></ol><h2 id="the-main-elements-of-an-apple-watch-face">The main elements of an Apple Watch face</h2><p>Continuing on, to appreciate what makes each of Apple’s historically-derived
faces unique, let’s start by understanding what they have in common. They come
in two primary shapes, rectangular and circular.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="intro shapes" title="intro shapes" src="https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/20801/intro_shapes.jpg" srcset="https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/98e5d/intro_shapes.jpg 180w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/543cd/intro_shapes.jpg 360w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/20801/intro_shapes.jpg 720w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/b37e7/intro_shapes.jpg 1080w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/33266/intro_shapes.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Some faces integrate both the dial and bezel on screen, which is likely why

Rolexes — so-called because of the bubble-shaped back that gave the watches a
thin appearance. Strikingly, the indices are set both in Roman and Arabic
numerals where other watches would stick to one or the other. It’s thought that
mixing numerals aids both the wearer and his brothers-in-arms in reading the

NASA added that if this scenario occurred during a flight, the rocket would have continued to power through using redundant systems onboard. NASA clarified that the major component failure on engine 4 and the flash outside the same engine are non-critical issues unrelated to the hot fire shutdown, and that the rocket core stage and engines are healthy.</p><p>Two days later, NASA added that according to the team’s <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/01/21/green-run-update-hot-fire-met-many-objectives-test-assessment-underway/">preliminary assessment</a>, many of the required 23 high-level test objectives were met despite the early shutdown, and that they will evaluate if another hot fire test is needed or if SLS can fly directly for <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/around-the-moon-with-nasa-s-first-launch-of-sls-with-orion">Artemis I</a>. This is in stark contrast to SLS program manager John Honeycutt’s statement before the test which noted that NASA hoped to get at least 250 seconds worth of data to test all the objectives. Whether the SLS hot fires again or flies, the team needs to dry out and refurbish the engines first, which they’re doing.</p><p>A 3.9-billion-year old <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/nasa-lends-moon-rock-to-new-administration/">piece of the Moon now sits in the Oval Office</a> of the White House.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In recent years, mainstream liberal opinion has undergone two shifts that, critics often allege, pose a challenge to the operating principles of the judicial system. The first is an increasing skepticism towards principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence, exemplified such phenomena as the weaponization of Title IX on campuses and the celebration of “cancellation” as a means of enforcing ideological and behavioral standards. The second is the call for abolishing police, prisons, and other instruments of law enforcement. These goals, fringe positions not long ago, have now entered the mainstream.</p><p>The more apocalyptic opponents of these trends charge that they will lead to civilizational collapse, as “mob justice” overtakes the rule of law. An alternative, more cynical view is that they will (unintentionally) contribute to developments that have already been in the process of obsolescing the legal system, as advanced technologies automate aspects of the judicial and law enforcement apparatus. For example, the drive to abolish policing may help enable its replacement with privatized surveillance systems, a trend already underway in some places. Rather than a descent into chaos, then, the end result may be more sophisticated mechanisms of control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These two assessments are not necessarily at odds. Instead, emergent modes of advanced technological control may incorporate, and be fueled by, the archaic social patterns associated with “mob justice,” such as reciprocal vengeance and scapegoating. In fact, there is considerable evidence that this fusion has been underway for some time. What follows is a speculative account of this trajectory by way of the work of two modern theorists of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>In his 1990 essay “Postscript on the Societies of Control,” the philosopher Gilles Deleuze identifies the beginnings of a transition away from the “disciplinary” structures epitomized by modern law enforcement. Building upon the work of Michel Foucault, Deleuze locates “discipline” in the socio-political arrangements that took hold in the West in the nineteenth century. Under this regime, individuals were granted universal rights but disciplined by the “spaces of enclosure” they occupied at any given time: the family, the school, the factory, the prison, and so on. The microscopic regulation imposed within these spaces constituted, for Foucault, “the other, dark side” of the rights accorded by the state. In his words, “[t]he real, corporeal disciplines constituted the foundation of the formal, juridical liberties.” The state could grant freedom because it entrusted disciplinary institutions with constraining it at every point.</p><p>To grasp the current crisis of this system, consider two seemingly disparate examples: the “school to prison pipeline” and the recent transformation of Title IX. In the first case, the incapacity of the school to enforce its localized disciplinary regime leads to an adjacency to the penal system. The school becomes parasitic on the mechanisms of the harshest closed environment, the prison, because its internal regulations have ceased to be enforceable. In a parallel but contrasting manner, consider Title IX: a perceived failure of enforcement (sexual assault on campus) within a particular disciplinary space leads to a “state of exception” in which the normal expectations of due process and presumption of innocence are suspended.&nbsp;</p><p>Superficially, the results differ somewhat. In the first case, the school begins to address juvenile infractions more similarly to how they are treated in the “adult world.” In the second, the harshness of the enforcement mechanisms may in fact exceed those that obtain in the extra-institutional world, with the justification that the consequence is not incarceration but expulsion from that space. But the basic result is the same: both lead to punitive excesses that symptomatize the collapse of the disciplinary mechanisms specific to a space of enclosure.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the controversy that has swirled around both of these developments, it is not difficult now to see how they might simply dissipate rather than ever being resolved. Both the traditional school and the brick-and-mortar university may be facing their end as the COVID pandemic accelerates the universalization of remote learning. The disciplinary procedures on which these institutions rely, based on the enclosure of bodies in space, would in this case be rendered irrelevant. This development would be in line with one of Deleuze’s expectations for the “societies of control” that, he predicted in 1990, would succeed the societies of discipline. In societies of control, he argued, bodies would circulate more freely, but be tracked at all times.</p><p>To grasp this notion, consider the prison, “preeminent instance of the closed environment” (Deleuze), lately targeted for abolition. But what if this abolition is already in progress, regardless of activist demands? Communicative devices, which are rendering in-person education archaic, may also make good on Deleuze’s prediction that the remote monitoring of location will sound the death knell of the carceral system. Writing in 1990, he had to assure his readers that “the conception of a control mechanism, giving the position of any element within an open environment in any given instance” was “not necessarily one of science fiction.” Today, every citizen carries a device that functions similarly to the location-tracking collars and ankle bracelets that Deleuze saw as the harbingers of the emergent societies of control. It’s unclear why these would not eventually make the enclosure of criminals in space unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, I have pointed to ongoing trends that seem to realize Deleuze’s predictions regarding the development of societies of control. If he proves correct, activists who target disciplinary institutions for abolition or reform run the risk of contributing to processes they have little ability to control. In this way, those who believe they are liberating us from oppression could ironically end up facilitating new forms of it. Or as Deleuze puts it, what “could at first express new freedom . . . could participate as well in mechanisms of control that are equal to the harshest of confinements.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>Social media platforms are a clear instantiation of the sorts of distributed networks of control Deleuze anticipated. Simply put, they offer a certain freedom at the cost of perpetual surveillance. However, there are salient patterns of social existence within these control networks that Deleuze’s account did not foresee. These are the patterns targeted by both liberal and conservative critics of the social media platforms that are the clearest instantiations of such networks: their tendency toward mob dynamics. On the right, criticisms of these dynamics have taken the form of attacks on “cancel culture.” While many on the left have downplayed the significance of this phenomenon, they have expressed grave concern about the structurally similar phenomenon of online harassment. In both instances, although the content and severity of the attacks vary, what’s at stake is a largely anonymous mob’s exploitation of the platform’s tendency towards herd behavior to punish an individual for some perceived infraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To understand these dynamics, and how they interact with the modes of control these platforms enact, we should turn to a very different French theorist of the same generation as Deleuze: René Girard. Girard contrasts the modern state, with its laws and rights, not with the systems of advanced technological control poised to succeed it, but with the modes of regulating violence that predated it. The most important of these, he claims, was sacrifice. In his 1972 book <em>Violence and the Sacred</em>, Girard argues that “sacrificial rites . . . assume essential roles in societies that lack a firm judicial system.” The book’s thesis is that all religion is originally sacrificial at its core, and that sacrificial religion was the primary means by which premodern societies protected themselves from a collapse into Hobbesian “war of all against all.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To make sense of this claim, we must grasp Girard’s theory of human violence. According to him, humans’ mimetic, or imitative, nature means that we desire things not due to their intrinsic qualities but because others desired them first. As a result, people inevitably come to desire the same things and come into conflict over them. For Girard, it is in this scenario that all societies face the prospect of their dissolution. Spirals of reciprocal aggression, best illustrated by the blood vendettas endemic to many cultures in periods of crisis, result from violent mimeticism: coincident desires cause conflict, and violence begets more violence via imitation. Modern judicial systems attempt to address this risk by channeling conflicts through neutral arbitration mechanisms. But the emergence of such mechanisms is a historically recent development. Girard’s claim is that sacrifice regulates violence in cultures lacking such systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is the second basic building block of Girard’s theory: the scapegoat mechanism. His speculative account of human origins posits that when mimetic violence spirals out of control, a society may dissolve, or it may reconsolidate itself by displacing the violence onto a single “surrogate victim.” The divided community cathartically reunites in violent unanimity against this victim, who is expelled or murdered. Mimetic automatism, which caused divisions to proliferate, now enables realignment as the group’s multiplying internal antagonisms dissolve into its collective antagonism against the scapegoat. Sacrifice is the formalization of this mechanism. Through it, Girard claims, traditional societies used ritualized violence to maintain social unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Girard attributes the demise of sacrificial religion in the modern world to various factors, especially the anti-sacrificial tendencies …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

    <div>
    <div id="pokemon-go-and-digital-privacy">

<p>I never meant to write this article, but I also never meant to wander around
London in a three-piece suit chasing invisible monsters. The two however are
very closely tied up.</p>
<p>My wife sent me a text yesterday with a quick question  "Paul, what's all this
about Pokemon Go? Should we let the kids have it?"</p>
<p>The kids in this case are 7 and 5 and like many kids their age have dipped in
and out of Pokemon phases - watching the TV show on Netflix, playing a handheld
game, and pretending to be Charmander while running around gardens and parks. It
seemed, and let's face it, <em>is</em> harmless.</p>
<p>Pokemon is a "media franchise" from Nintendo, and is fairly simple at its heart -
an 11ish year old boy who lives in a world where small monsters with "powers"
are real and living wild.  The trainers capture them from the wild, train them
to build up their powers and then Pokemon engage in fights with other trainers
Pokemon, leading to winning a tournament and glory, points, prizes and school
playground bragging rights. Of course in the TV series many lessons about
friendship and honour are learnt, and no one is really hurt.</p>
<p>All in all, I am relaxed about them playing Pokemon to date.  A bit too much TV
perhaps and not enough running around but it's a simple theme with a generally
positive message and has stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Then smartphones.</p>
<div id="smartphones-are-great">
<h2>Smartphones are great.</h2>
<p>I am overall positive about the digital age we have been living in (and for me,
working in) since the early '90s.  And it has massively, truly, accelerated
since 2007 when first the iPhone and then "cloud services" gave the
Internet a "Fast and Furious" style dose of nitrous oxide.</p>
<p>There are some amazingly great things going to come out of this digital age.
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government services</a> are going to leap forward a
generation as they move to digital, we will join hands across national
boundaries in ways that customs officials will panic over, but mostly we will
benefit from near-continuous monitoring.</p>
<p>The smartphone was the harbinger of near constant, highly detailed tracking of
our actions, in the real and virtual worlds.  It is possible to track my
physical location, track what I ate, what the air was like as I breathed there.
Add this to my genetic code, my health records and then do it for every person
in the country, in the whole (western) world.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology">Epidemiology</a> is a fantastic
branch of science.  It studies the mass of people to look for medical and public
health improvements.  The most famous one was a cholera outbreak in
Mid-Victorian London. A doctor mapped all the cases he was treating, and saw
they grouped around one place - a public water tap.  He removed the handle and
the outbreak stopped, proving cholera was water based, and that mapping people's
day to day lives can really help.</p>
<p>Nowadays the doctor can use people's iPhone data to discover which well they
drank from. Modern day doctors could map genetics, lifestyle and environment in
ways that will reveal more about the causes of diseases.  Infrastructure,
transport, town planning, school sizes, GP catchment areas, all will <em>could</em>
more fine grained, better.</p>
<p>We will come back to this later - but start off with the idea that tracking our
daily lives <em>can</em> lead to really good benefits for everyone - if we use the data
wisely.</p>

<h2>Pokemon Go</h2>
<p>Pokemon Go is what is known as an augmented reality app.  You have heard of
virtual reality where you put on a clunky looking headset and your eyes see a
totally computer generated world.  Augmented Reality (AR) is where you look
through the screen of your phone and see the real world via the camera, but the
app overlays some extra information on top of the image. In a museum it might
overlay some notes about the painter.  In Pokemon go it overlays a moving
cartoon of a Pokemon.</p>
<p>Now, if you as a child want to catch a wild Pokemon, you no longer sit on your
sofa computer controller in hand. You go out into the fresh air and walk around.
(Good!). The app shows you a map, and you walk to the field, the park, the
street corner, and look through the screen - and there is a Pokemon monster
hiding behind the lamppost, waiting to be caught by swiping the right part of
the screen.</p>
<p>I have played Pokemon Go briefly, and almost every 10th person walking down the
street in London's financial district this lunchtime was doing the same. Adults.
Slightly shame-faced adults actually.  But Adults.  This game is going to get
<em>big</em>.  All the kids will want to play.  And to do so they will have to tell
Nintendo where they are, where they came from, where they are going.</p>
</div>
<div id="dark-side-of-tracking">
<h2>Dark side of tracking</h2>
<p>Can we trust Nintendo with that data?  Probably not.  A few days ago it was
<a href="http://adamreeve.tumblr.com/post/147120922009/pokemon-go-is-a-huge-security-risk">discovered</a>
that when signing up via Google, users were asked to hand over "full"
permissions. This means Nintendo had ability amoung other things, to read, send
and delete users gmail emails.  This seems a genuine mistake and has been fixed
since, but there is a sad <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/category/data-breaches/">litany</a> of companies collecting
data and then not securing it, letting it out into the hands of criminals and
others.</p>
<p>On top of which, and most worrying, is the push for social media companies to
get you to connect as widely as possible, which suits their business model. And
is why most schools ask you not to put photos on other peoples kids on Facebook.
Stalkers and angry ex-husbands can connect and once they do moving house (again)
is a real pain.</p>
<p>In May 2013, Edward Snowden, an ex-CIA Computer professional stole thousands of
top level documents that showed how the governments of the US, UK and elsewhere
were systematically gathering, well, pretty much eveything on everyone.  The
documents that Snowden made available to newspapers showed a mass program of
staggering proportions, that sucked in data from Facebook, Google, phone
providers, ISPs, that watched websites we visited and emails we sent. For almost
everyone globally.  They even used submarines to "tap" undersea cables.  It was
that comprehensive.  And it was and is probably illegal, certainly unethical and
definitely not something people knew about.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the world, well, Chinese hackers it seems spent a year in the
unsecured portions of the Office of Personnel Management.  They probably have
stolen data, including security clearances, on almost every employee of the
federal government, military included.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-your-child-be-tracked">
<h2>Can your child be tracked?</h2>
<p>This is the million dollar question. And the answer is, yes, of course, they
already are, by "everyone".  Everyone includes of course the Intelligence
agencies of the western world, and the providers of many digital services, ones
you know such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Nintendo, and ones you dont like
the hundreds of advertising agencies that buy and sell data on anyone living ina
digital world.</p>
<p>Access to, and use of, any digital service, gets you noticed, tracked and
collected by a vast array of actors, commercial, governmental and criminal.  And
some individuals.  When we give our kids an iPad, or similar, we put a little
bleeper on their heads.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-s-missing">
<h2>What's missing?</h2>
<p>The app as it is is fun, and will be a huge hit.  Already advertisers <a href="https://next.ft.com/content/75942b12-48ba-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c">are
looking</a> at
ways they can bend the rules of the game to their advantage.  Luring potential
customers to sponsored locations seems amusing, but has no-one heard what
happened with the Pied Piper?</p>
<p>Trying to monetise apps is already one of the fastest ways to take all the fun
out of them, and I suspect this will be the case here.  But after all the talk
of privacy, we can easily imagine a better game.</p>
<p>One thing I tried was to see how my phone and my friends phone saw the same
Pokemon. Sadly the pokemon on each screen seemed unaware it was being watched
from two angles.  It rather spilt the illusion of a creature "really there".  If
our two phones could talk to each other they could agree on which way the
pokemon was facing and the illusion would be better.  Now add in a fight between
two pokemon where my friend and I can See the two fighting in real time. And
then add in a few friends who can watch giant monsters go at it live right there
on the Thames River.</p>
<p>Now thats a great game.  But it has a technical requirment. That instead of
sending data back to Nintendo, Jaoan, the data needed to decided which way a
pokemon is facing only needs to be shared between the phones "watching" the
action. You see sending data back to say japan, even at the speed of light has a
noticeable delay.  But speed of light between phones a few yards apart is
imperceptible.</p>
<p>This sharing of data is known as mesh networking - and is generally ignored by
mainstream mobile.  Partly because it is a hard problem, and partly because
centralised services is much more profitable.  It is pretty silly if i want to
send a facebook message to a couple of friends a street away, for that message
to go to servers in San Francisco. Especially as such a message is consider
"international", and can be legally monitored by the UK intelligence services
even when they are banned from monitoring if I was to make a phone call two
streets apart.</p>
<p>But mostly that message would not be recorded by Facebook, and it would not be
able to interpret my friendships, my shopping habits, everything else from this
signal analysis And that would make Facebook far far far less valuable.</p>
<p>The technology of <em>local</em> communication, is one of the ways that we can reduce
this data pollution we are seeing. Alongside encryption, and policy changes we
can make the technological world one that has enormous beenfits for us with more
reasonable costs.</p>

<div id="privacy-and-policy">
<h2>Privacy and policy</h2>
<p>This article is really trying to lay out the new privacy landscape. The Pokemon
app is a useful way to explore that space, but it is up to us to decide what we
want our future to look like.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-now-what">
<h2>So now what?</h2>
<p>My first instinct is simple. I am happy for my kids to play this game - but only
with my devices and my identity.  I am not prepared, I do not have, the tools to
manage the data that is out there about me. Until then I want their …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

I’ve created a theme template and using Hugo I can easily generate a complete website. The generated website is then uploaded to a public B2 cloud bucket. Access to the website hosted in the B2 bucket is then provided through Cloudflare.</p><p>Taking advantage of the bandwidth alliance between B2 and Cloudflare gives free outbound bandwidth from B2 and inexpensive storage of your data. Currently B2 cloud charges $5 per month for 1TB of data and up to 10GB for free. Cloudflare workers are free up to 100,000 daily requests then it’s $5 per month for a few million requests and an additional 50 cents per million requests. This means the website can serve millions of requests per month for less than $10 per month.</p><h4 id="creating-the-website-bucket">Creating the website bucket</h4><p>After creating an account on B2 cloud create a new bucket and enable public access. Create an application key and give it access to the newly created bucket. Note down the application key and ID as they will be needed in the following steps.</p><h4 id="creating-the-hugo-website">Creating the Hugo website</h4><p>Hugo is a powerful static site generation tool with a large community and many free themes available. It has a powerful template engine and content management tools.</p><p>I created this websites current theme using Hugo templates and found it very enjoyable once I got more familiar with Hugo template order precedence.</p><p>Once the Hugo static website is ready you can build the static files with the <code>hugo</code> command. This generates the HTML files from the templates and content into a public directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">❯ hugo

</code></pre></div><h4 id="configure-cloudflare-workers-to-handle-the-requests">Configure Cloudflare Workers to handle the requests</h4><p>By default B2 cloud serves files from a URL that includes some unnecessary routes. In order to match the routes created in the website we can use Cloudflare Workers to handle the inbound requests. This also gives the ability to modify the request to remove some B2 debugging headers and do some error handling such as serving the 404.html page.</p><p>You will need to configure a domain in Cloudflare for the website. Then create a new worker and routes to send requests to the domain to the worker. Configure the domain with a CNAME record pointing to the domain of the B2 bucket.</p><p><img src="https://roote.ca/about/tutorials/static-site/cloudflare_static.png" alt="Cloudflare DNS setting"></p><p>In the site configuration page rules section ensure cache level is set to everything and automatic HTTPS rewrites are enabled.</p><p><img src="https://roote.ca/about/tutorials/static-site/cloudflare_page_rules.png" alt="Cloudflare Page Rules"></p><p>I’ve based the worker code off of this great example found <a href="https://jross.me/free-personal-image-hosting-with-backblaze-b2-and-cloudflare-workers/">here.</a> Using this code with some small modifications allows you to use B2 as the web server with full caching in the Cloudflare network.</p><p>I’ve made some modifications to allow serving the index.html page without specifying it directly as one limitation of B2 cloud is that there isn’t a concept of an index page for HTTP requests. I’ve also added some checks to see if the request to B2 gives a 404 error, if so it will return the 404 page included with the website. This prevents a user from seeing the 404 page directly from the B2 cloud bucket.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>'use strict'</span>;

		Share </p><p>Early my career, a CFO asked me a very good question. “If IT can’t deliver a return on investment that is better than what I could get by putting corporate monies into a bank savings account, then why would I want to invest in IT?”</p>
<p>At the time, I didn’t have a good answer. In fact, I was a bit embarrassed. But looking back, I realize that he was absolutely right.</p>
<p>Is your IT organization delivering a good return on investment? Or is your IT organization being silently killed?</p>
<h2><strong>Where does IT spend the business’ money?</strong></h2>
<p>If I look at the broad categories of IT spend, there are three categories where IT spends the business’ money:</p>
<p><strong>KTLO</strong>, or <strong>K</strong>eeping <strong>T</strong>he <strong>L</strong>ights <strong>O</strong>n, can be thought of as the cost of doing business. All other things remaining equal, KTLO is spend that typically fluctuates little on a year to year basis. This category includes spending on things like support contracts, salaries, training, regulatory and legal compliance, and maintenance and support activities to keep current systems running optimally.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong> represents investments in technology. This type of spend includes initiatives like new systems, new lines of business, technology enablement of new business products, mergers and acquisitions, or significant expansions of existing services. This can be thought of as “grow the business” or “transform the business” kinds of spend.</p>
<p>What is the third category of IT spending?</p>
<p><strong>Break-fix. </strong>Break-fix represents spending related to failed changes. Recurring incidents. Major incidents. Failed deployments. Re-work. Poor quality.</p>
<p>When technology breaks, or changes fail, or an issue occurs that interrupts the business’ ability to do business, IT must stop whatever it is doing and fix the issue. Granted, some (hopefully limited) number of outages and failures should be expected. After all, technology ages and at some point, may fail. Business situations emerge in ways that software was perhaps not designed to manage. The bottom line is that when things break, IT has to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Regardless of whether IT is spending its time KTLO, innovating, or fixing, it<em> all pays the same</em>. To say it differently, an organization’s IT personnel are paid the same, regardless of what they’re working on.</p>
<p>Here’s the other thing. CFOs expect IT to deliver within its annual budget. IT doesn’t get more budget money to spend, just because it’s spending more money “fixing” rather than “innovating”.</p>
<p>If you’re the CFO, where would you like to see IT spending its time? Certainly not on “break-fix”.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the impact?</strong></h2>
<p>What happens when fixing issues and constant rework becomes (nearly) a way of life for the IT organization?</p>
<p>Well, two things.</p>
<p>First, remember those innovation projects that had been planned? When IT spends more time on “fixing”, those innovation projects get broken out into subprojects in the hopes of getting “something” rather than “nothing” done. Or they get delayed until the next budget cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or they get outsourced to someone else. Or they don’t get done at all. Why? Because IT is too busy with rework and fixing, it has no time to work on the innovation that the business requested.</p>
<p>Second, the reputation and credibility of the IT organization become damaged. While some in IT may be (briefly) recognized for their <a href="https://www.dougtedder.com/2015/05/02/we-dont-need-another-hero/">heroic efforts</a> in “putting out the fires”, the longer-term damage is being done. IT becomes perceived as being too reactive, inconsistent, incompetent, and unreliable.</p>
<h2><strong>Are the silent killers evident at your IT organization?</strong></h2>
<p>I just finished reading “The Art of Business Value” by Mark Schwartz<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. In the book, Schwartz described the abstracted total of IT capabilities for many organizations – software, infrastructure, the whole bit – as a giant hairball. This giant hairball is continually getting new pieces stuck to it – and not all of it pretty. The hairball clearly has value to the organization – it enables the business! – but the hairball is continually becoming more and more difficult to manage.</p>
<p>And, in my opinion, it’s this hairball that is silently killing IT.</p>
<p>“Break-fix” is just one thing that is silently killing IT. What are some other silent killers?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uneven effort</strong>. There are often overlapping efforts by those in IT – multiple people doing similar activities. Or even worse – there are gaps in effort. Things that should be getting done, but are not.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>. No one is able to identify what happens to investments in IT. No one can adequately describe the value proposition of IT. All the business knows is that it spends monies on IT. It’s not consistently clear of what is coming out of IT.</li>
<li><strong>Increased spending in KTLO</strong>. Because systems aren’t being retired, or new applications or technologies are continually being bolted-on to legacy systems, the cost just to keep the lights on rises from year to year.</li>
<li><strong>Inability to respond </strong>to changing business needs in a timely fashion. IT is unable to deploy new or updated technology in the timeframes or in a manner required by business.</li>
<li><strong>IT personnel lack business acumen</strong>. IT people think and talk only in terms of “bits and bytes” and have no ability to relate technology efforts to business outcomes and value.</li>
<li><strong>Avoidance</strong>. From the business perspective, it’s too darn difficult to do business with IT. So, the business doesn’t invite IT to strategy discussions. “Shadow” technology projects pop up within business areas, or aspects of technology use are outsourced.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Silencing the Silent Killers</strong></h2>
<p>IT organizations are complex and ever-evolving. And while all of the current talk of IT needing to be more agile and responsive is well and good, the fact remains that most IT organizations are stuck grooming a hairball. And it’s that hairball that is killing the IT organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; What can the IT organization do?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define the service portfolio</strong>. Identify and capture the business outcomes, total cost of ownership, needed resources, and business value of what IT does in the service portfolio. Not only will this illustrate how technology provides business value, it will also help identify areas of technical debt and help with informed decision-making regarding the use of technology within the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Develop business acumen</strong>. Understanding the business of the business – and the contribution that technology makes to the business – is critical for survival of the IT organization. Talk with business colleagues in business terms!</li>
<li><strong>Formally define processes</strong>. If there ever was anything close to a silver bullet for IT challenges, having defined processes might just be it. First, defined processes help IT understand what is to be done and by whom. Defined processes document and enable flow. Lastly, defined processes enable automation, which helps IT become more responsive to business demands.</li>
<li><strong>Make regular payments on technical debt</strong>. Unabated, the IT hairball will only become worse. IT must dedicate focused efforts to pay down the organization’s technical debt. This should include activities such as kaizens, re-architecting systems from being monolithic to being more modular, and allocating part of all new project spend toward retirement (and shutdown) of non-necessary legacy systems.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash your “inner salesperson”</strong>. If you’re unable to promote the value of IT, you can’t expect anyone outside of IT to perceive value. Continually sell the value proposition of the IT organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to answer why investment in IT is a good thing for the organization. What will your CFO see as the return in the investment of the business’ monies into IT?</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes the silent killers of IT so dangerous is the fact that IT organizations don’t recognize them…until it is too late. Don’t let your IT organization fall victim to these silent killers. My five actions for stopping the silent killers will help IT demonstrate a good return on investment for the business.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Every novice Pythonista is familiar with the trusty built-in function <code>print()</code>. Its job is simple: output the string representation of an object or expression.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>'the answer is 3'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But let’s say you want to change the behavior of print. Instead of sending its output to the terminal, let’s send that output to a file on the disk. We can accomplish this by redefining the print variable.</p>



<p>The full function signature of print is:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>objects</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>end</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span><span>,</span> <span>flush</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note the third keyword argument, <code>file</code>. The default value of <code>file</code> is <code>sys.stdout</code>, which represents the terminal output buffer. The only real requirement for the object passed to <code>file</code> is that it has a <code>.write()</code> method. You know what has a write method? File handlers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'log.txt'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a+'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span># f is a file handler
</span>    <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s redefine the print variable to instead be a wrapper function around the vanilla built-in <code>print()</code>. The wrapped <code>print()</code> needs to be referenced through the <code>builtins</code> module so that we don’t define a recursive function.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>builtins</span>

<span>def</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'log.txt'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a+'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, when we call <code>print()</code>, no output is displayed in the terminal. However, if we read the contents of <code>log.txt</code>, we can see that our redefined <code>print()</code> has written to the file.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>log.txt
the answer is 3</code></pre></figure>



<p>Let’s make it weird. We can actually redefine <code>print()</code> to be a buffer object that stores all the strings that are passed to it for printing. Instead of a function, <code>print</code> will be an instance of a class that inherits <code>io.StringIO</code>.</p>

<p><code>StringIO</code> is a in-memory text buffer that works similarly to a file handler. In fact, file handlers and <code>StringIO</code> both implement the abstract base class <code>IOBase</code>, which means they have many of the same methods defined.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example of how to use <code>StringIO</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>io</span>

<span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>StringIO</span><span>()</span>
<span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'here is some input'</span><span>)</span>
<span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>getvalue</span><span>()</span>
<span>'here is some input'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s define a new subclass of <code>StringIO</code> called <code>PrintWrapper</code>. We’re also going to define a <code>__call__</code> magic method on this new class. <code>__call__</code> allows you to define how an instance of a class behaves when it is called like a function.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>builtins</span>
<span>import</span> <span>io</span>

<span>class</span> <span>PrintWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>io</span><span>.</span><span>StringIO</span><span>):</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__call__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Pass the object instance (self) as the file
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span> <span>=</span> <span>PrintWrapper</span><span>()</span> <span># print is now the printer AND a buffer
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'this was added to buffer'</span><span>)</span>  <span># triggers print.__call__()
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'this was also added to the buffer'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>.</span><span>getvalue</span><span>()</span>
<span>'this was added to buffer</span><span>\n</span><span>this was also added to buffer</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Strings that you have printed are seperated by <code>\n</code> when you call print.getvalue(), but you can define a different seperator by passing it as a string to the <code>end=</code> keyword argument of <code>builtins.print()</code>.</p>



<p>Why would you ever want to do any of this? Well, let’s say you are building a web-based programming environment like <a href="https://coderpad.io/">CoderPad</a>. When a user calls <code>print()</code>, you probably wouldn’t want the Python interpreter running on the server to send the printed statement to stdout. You might instead want it to be outputted to a handler that transmits it to the user’s browser over the Internet. There are probably other ways to accomplish this, but redefining <code>print()</code> behind the scenes is one possibility.</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of blog entries I’m calling “baby snakes”, bits of Python arcana aimed at intermediate and advanced Python developers. Please check back soon for more!</p>

themselves to adapt to an open source world, and typical open source
projects moving towards—oftentimes centralized—governance models, the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral–Bazaar</a> dichotomy feels increasingly less relevant.</p><p>It was met with
<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.
LLVM equips people to build programming languages. LSP gives people potent
software development capabilities. Rails empowers people to build powerful
web applications.</p><blockquote><p>More than 3,000 people have committed man-decades, maybe even
man-centuries, of work for free. Buying all that effort at market rates
would have been hundreds of millions of dollars. Who would have been able
to afford funding that?</p><p>That’s a …</p></blockquote></div></div>

      <p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is a great resource. However, I seemed to constantly run into two issues. 1.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>With more and more content being hosted on GitHub it's a shame that you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. At least not by GitHub, that is. But you can build your own notification service. Here is how.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.png" alt="Adaptive card with a notification about a changed file on GitHub displayed in Microsoft Teams"> </picture> <h2>More than source control</h2> <p>GitHub is more than just the place where developers post their code. Over the last few years, it evolved also into a huge repository of content published through blogs and docs. For many, it's the go-to place to stay up-to-date on what's new.</p> <p>While GitHub offers us a way to get notified of changes to repos, the notifications options are limited. You can get notified of new releases or pull requests, but you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. With many devs using specific pages for announcing releases or keeping their changelog, being able to get notified of changes to these specific files, allows you to stay up-to-date on what's new and what's coming.</p> <h2>Build your own GitHub file changes notifier</h2> <p>To build your own GitHub file changes notifier, all you need is an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure subscription</a>. In the subscription, you will create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">function app</a>, a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/storage/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage account</a> and a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logic app</a>. Here is the high-level of the solution architecture:</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing architecture of the solution"> </picture> <p>The storage account holds the list of files to check for changes. For each file, you will store its URL, title - for use with notifications, and a hash of its contents used to determine if the file has changed since the last time.</p> <p>The function app hosts the scheduled process that at the specified time retrieves the list of files from the storage account (1), iterates through them, for each (2) one checks if it changed and sends a notification if it did (3). If the file has changed, the function app also updates the file hash in the storage account (4).</p> <p>While there are unlimited ways to send a notification, I find using logic apps the easiest. Logic apps are extremely versatile and with just a few clicks you can set them up to receive notifications on Teams, via email, or on your phone, without having to deal with authentication, response handling, etc.</p> <h3>Set up a storage account</h3> <p>Start, by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a storage account</a> in your resource group. In the storage account, create a table named <code>files</code>. For each file that you want to track, insert an item to the table including its <code>title</code> and <code>url</code>.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.png" alt="Table row showing information about a file on GitHub to monitor for changes"> </picture> <p>For each file, use the same partition key and a unique row key.</p> <h3>Create a logic app for sending notifications</h3> <p>In this example, we'll <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a logic app</a> that sends a notification to the user on Microsoft Teams.</p> <p>In your resource group, create a logic app. Use the <strong>When a HTTP request is received</strong> trigger. As a sample payload, to generate the request schema specify:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let's walk through the different pieces of the script.</p> <h4>Load dependencies</h4> <p>Start, by loading the necessary dependencies:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>axios</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>axios</span><span>'</span><span>).</span><span>default</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We'll use <strong>axios</strong> to execute web requests to download files and trigger notifications. <strong>axios</strong> makes it way easier than using the raw HTTP calls from Node.js. We also need the crypto functions so that we can calculate the hash for the downloaded file contents.</p> <h4>Reference input binding</h4> <p>Extend the function's function to include the <strong>Table parameter name</strong> you copied previously. This argument will contain all files that you've added to the storage account.</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>,</span> <span>timer</span><span>,</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h4>Store information about changed files</h4> <p>Next, let's define two arrays for storing information about changed files:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// array of files that have changed</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
<span>// array of notifications</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFilesNotifications</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We need two arrays because if we've just added a file to the storage account, its hash (<code>null</code>) will not match the hash retrieved from GitHub and would result in you getting a notification that the file has changed, while it's not quite the case. Storing information about the file that changed and files for which we should issue a notification allows avoiding the unnecessary initial notification.</p> <h4>Retrieve file contents</h4> <p>Then, let's retrieve contents of all files we're tracking:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// retrieve file contents</span>
<span>const</span> <span>requests</span> <span>=</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// if it's a github URL, make it point to the raw file to avoid comparing github UI changes</span>

    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>//github.com/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>After a whole year of the pandemic, we are in a highly critical situation across Europe. Thousands are dying every day and many more are falling ill. The novel coronavirus is spreading at a rapid speed, now even accelerated by its mutations. Measures implemented by governments are not enough: they are prolonging the pandemic instead of ending it, and they are putting our lives in danger.</p><p>The strategy of controlling the pandemic has failed (‘flatten the curve’). It has restricted life permanently and has still brought about millions of infections and tens of thousands of deaths. We now need a radical change in strategy: not a controlled continuation of the pandemic but its end. The aim cannot be 200, 50 or 25 new infections – it has to be zero.</p><p>To fight the pandemic effectively, we immediately need a joint strategy in Europe. With vaccinations alone, the race against the mutated virus cannot be won ­– even less so if fighting the pandemic consists of actionist restrictions of leisure without a shutdown of the economy. We are campaigning for an immediate reduction of Sars-CoV-2-infections to a level at which every single infection can be traced again. Determined action by several countries has shown that it is possible to end the spread of the virus.</p><p>The international call for <a href="https://www.containcovid-pan.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Pan-European commitment for rapid and sustained reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections</a>, initiated by scientists on 19<sup>th</sup> December 2020, is a basis for our campaign. But we are convinced that an end to the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus can only succeed if all measures are planned in social solidarity. We therefore demand these necessary measures:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Down to zero collectively</strong>: the first aim is to reduce infections to zero. In order to avoid a ping-pong effect between countries and regions, all European countries have to act fast and in parallel. When this aim has been reached, restrictions can be lifted carefully in a second step. Low case numbers have to be maintained with a strategy of control, and local outbreaks have to be contained immediately and rigorously. We also need a joint long-term vision – and regional and national plans of action on this basis. These would encompass screening and vaccination strategies, protection of high-risk groups and support of those especially affected by the pandemic.</p><p>To reach this aim, we need a break in solidarity for a couple of weeks. <strong>Shutdown means: we limit our direct contacts to a minimum – including our contacts at work!</strong> Measures cannot be effective if they are only focussed on leisure and exclude work. We have to shut down those parts of the economy which are not urgently needed for society. Factories, offices, companies, construction sites, schools have to be closed and the duty to work must be put on hold. This break has to last for as long as it takes to reach the aims mentioned above. It is important that workers plan the measures in companies themselves and implement them collectively. With this statement, we also call upon unions to take a determined stand for the health of workers, to support the activism of workers for their health, and to organise the necessary large collective break together.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Leave no one behind</strong>: people can only stay at home if they are in a financially stable position. A comprehensive aid package for all is needed. People who are particularly affected by the shutdown have to be supported specifically – people with a low income, people living in cramped conditions, in a violent environment, or people who are homeless. Forced collective accommodation has to end, refugees should be housed individually. People who are doing a lot of care work during shutdown need to be relieved through communal organisation. Children should receive online teaching, in small groups if necessary.</p><p><strong>3. Expansion of the social infrastructure for health</strong>: The whole health and care sector has to be expanded immediately and sustainably. This also relates to health departments and institutions responsible for contact tracing. More people need to be employed in this sector. Wages need to be raised. Profit interests in the health and care sector endanger our collective health. We demand the revocation of privatisations and closures in this sector. Financing hospitals through case rates should be replaced by financing all necessary expenses in solidarity.</p><p><strong>4. Vaccines are global commons</strong>: a global pandemic can only be overcome globally. Public and private enterprises have to prepare and conduct the necessary production of vaccines immediately. Vaccines should be withdrawn from private profit-making. They are the result of the creative collaboration of many people, and they need to belong to all of humanity.</p><p><strong>5. Financing in solidarity</strong>: the necessary measures cost a lot of money. Societies in Europe have amassed an enormous amount of wealth which has been appropriated by the few. With this wealth, the comprehensive break from work and all measures of solidarity can easily be funded. This is why we demand the introduction of a European Covid-solidarity tax on high wealth, company profits, financial transactions, and the highest incomes.</p><p>We want to overcome the political paralysis in dealing with&nbsp;corona. We want to mobilise in Germany, Austria and Switzerland for the necessary solidarity for a ZeroCovid strategy. As our <a href="https://zerocovid.uk/">comrades in the UK</a>, we know that we need to fight for the protection of our health against short-term profit interests and against large parts of the political sphere.</p><p>There is no contradiction between the protection of health and fighting the pandemic on the one hand and the defence of democratic rights and the rule of law on the other. Democracy without public health is useless and cynical. Public health without democracy leads to authoritarianism. The connection of both is the decisive key to a ZeroCovid strategy in solidarity.</p><p><em>January 12, 2021.</em></p><div><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

  <p>I recently built a static website for a friend using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We installed everything he needed to add content to his website on his laptop. And by all I mean just Hugo and Visual Studio Code. Then he reset his laptop and that set me thinking if we can do with even less, preferably installing nothing at all on his computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> came to mind. With GitHub Codespaces (currently in early access) we get a full VSCode powered development environment in the browser. Best of all it runs in an Ubuntu container giving terminal access, includes tools like Hugo out of the box and handles port forwarding for us.</p>
<p>There's something to be aware of with the automatic port forwarding and static assets such as images. So in this post I'll show how you can build and debug a static site built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> in GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>We'll first create an empty repository in GitHub. Make sure to add an empty README file, so we can easily open it with codespaces later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-repository.png" alt="Create new repository with README"></p>
<p>Open GitHub Codespaces in the navigation bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespaces.png" alt="Codespaces link in the GitHub navbar"></p>
<p>Then create a new Codespace by selecting our repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-codespace.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<p>After a minute your VSCode environment should be ready to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespace-ready.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We'll run the commands of the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo quick start</a> with one modification. If you prefer to just look at the code, check out the <a href="https://github.com/shotor/hugo-codespaces-example">repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># create a new site in the root folder, force it because it's not empty
</span><span>hugo</span><span> new site .</span><span> --force

</span><span># add ananke theme
</span><span>git</span><span> submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke

</span><span># set theme
</span><span>echo </span><span>'theme = "ananke"' </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> config.toml

</span><span># create new post
</span><span>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll add some content to our <code>my-first-post.md</code> file and also an image that we'll place in the <code>/static</code> folder (just drag it into the sidebar of your Codespace).</p>
<pre><code data-lang="md"><span>---
</span><span>title: 'My First Post'
date: 2021-01-24T12:00:00Z
</span><span>---

</span><span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus in fringilla libero.

</span><span>![</span><span>Placeholder image</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>/image.png</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we'll forward the port in the remote explorer tab. We know Hugo will run on 1313, so that's the port we will forward.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/port-forward.png" alt="Our forwarded port"></p>
<p>Now if we just run Hugo (<code>hugo server -D</code>) our homepage will work fine. But any internal link or image will fail with a 404 error because it refers to localhost and not our GitHub url. And also there's a port included in all the links.</p>
<p>To fix this we run a modified start command where we set the <code>baseUrl</code> to the url provided by GitHub. We can get this url by right clicking on our forwarded port, and copying the url. We also need to disable the port section (in this case :1313). Our command becomes:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>hugo</span><span> server</span><span> -D --baseUrl</span><span>=</span><span>"https://your-github-url"</span><span> --appendPort</span><span>=</span><span>false
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when we click on our first post, we'll see the blog post as well as the image we uploaded.</p>
<p>That's it, we now have a full development workflow completely in our browser. We can access it from anywhere to add content or make changes to the layout.</p>
<p>In this case we used Hugo, a static site generator. But this idea can be adapted to any type of webserver, for instance NodeJS or Django. As long as you bind the server to localhost and then forward the port. Making sure any internal links or images use the forwarded url as its base url.</p>
<h2 id="deployments-using-netlify">Deployments using Netlify</h2>
<p>To finish it off we'll add deployments using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. We'll follow <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">the Hugo tutorial</a> and create a <code>netlify.toml</code> file in the root directory.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>build</span><span>]

</span><span>HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO </span><span>= </span><span>"true"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Make sure we set the base url in <code>config.toml</code> to our Netlify url:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>baseURL </span><span>= </span><span>"https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/"

</span><span>title </span><span>= </span><span>"Hugo Codespaces Example"
</span><span>theme </span><span>= </span><span>"ananke"
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now commit and push all our changes. Which will trigger a build and deploy our static site. We can also create Pull Requests and have Netlify create preview environments for us, so we can test changes before merging them.</p>
<p>Our site is now live at <a href="https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/">https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/</a></p>
<p>All that's left to do is <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/">add a custom domain</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Codespaces makes it really easy to work on projects hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>There are limitations, the Ubuntu container doesn't allow you to run just any command you want, which makes sense.</p>
<p>For instance I tried to run a <a href="https://getzola.org/">Zola</a> project, but Zola requires <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft</a>. Which is not included and cannot be installed in Codespaces. To get Zola working I had to upload the Zola binary file myself. No big deal, but on a local or a self-hosted remote vscode environment this is a non-issue.</p>
<p>Right now I'm only using it for small projects. I'm very interested to see how it holds up with bigger projects. In terms of size, as well things required from the operating system.</p>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published January 23, 2021</p><p>Data quality is important.  This post continues exploring the
improved quality of OpenStreetMap data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex">via PgOSM-Flex</a>.
These improvements are enabled by the
<a href="https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#the-flex-output">new flex output of osm2pgsql</a>,
making it easier to understand and consume OpenStreetMap data for
analytic purposes.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/12/osm2gpsql-flex-output-to-postgis">started exploring the Flex output</a>
a few weeks ago,
the <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2021/01/postgis-openstreetmap-flex-structure">post before this one used PgOSM-Flex v0.0.3</a>.
This post uses PgOSM-Flex v0.0.7 and highlights a few cool improvements
by exploring the OSM place data.  Some of the improvements made of the past
few weeks were ideas brought over from the legacy PgOSM project.
Other improvements were spurred by questions and conversations with the
community, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/issues/37">nested admin polygons</a>.</p>
<h2>Improved places</h2>
<p>This post focuses on the <code>osm.place_polygon</code> data that stores things like
city, county and Country boundaries, along with neighborhoods and other details.
The the format of place data has a number of improvements covered in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidated name</li>
<li>Remove duplication between relation/member polygons</li>
<li>Boundary hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>The data loaded for this post is the <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us-west.html">U.S. West sub-region</a> from
Geofabrik.  It was loaded using the <code>run-all.lua</code> and <code>run-all.sql</code> scripts
in
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex">PgOSM-Flex</a>.</p>

<p>This post is part of the series <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2018/06/pg-series-toc"><em>PostgreSQL:  From Idea to Database</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Consolidated Name</h2>
<p>There are a variety of name tags used throughout various OSM features,
such as <code>name</code>, <code>alt_name</code>, <code>short_name</code>, and so on.
Since not all features are tagged equally, the name cleanup implemented in 
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/helpers.lua">helpers.lua</a> attemps to catch the majority of the name tags used.
The <code>get_name(tags)</code>
function is used for the <code>name</code> column in every layer throughout PgOSM-Flex,
not just the place layers.</p>
<pre><code>function get_name(tags)
    if tags.name then
        return tags.name
    elseif tags.short_name then
        return tags.short_name
    elseif tags.alt_name then
        return tags.alt_name
    elseif tags.loc_name then
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>This query shows more than 4,500 roads that end up with a value in <code>name</code>
that otherwise be missing.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM osm.road_line r
    INNER JOIN osm.tags t
        ON t.geom_type = 'W' AND r.osm_id = t.osm_id
            AND t.tags-&gt;&gt;'name' IS NULL -- The main name tag is empty
    WHERE r.name IS NOT NULL -- The road has a name
;

â”‚  4585 â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The above query takes advantage of the <code>osm.tags</code> table
that stores every feature with its full set of unaltered tag data.  <code>osm.tags</code> is the largest object loaded by PgOSM-Flex, considerable size can be saved by using <code>run-no-tags.lua</code> instead of <code>run-all.lua</code>.</p>
<p>Also, of note, is the use of <code>JSONB</code> instead of <code>HSTORE</code> throughout PgOSM-Flex.  The osm2pgsql project is still defaulting to <code>HSTORE</code> for legacy reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Relations and Member Polygons</h2>
<p>Many administrative boundaries have multiple parts making up their complex
shapes.
This results in the full relation polygon and multiple sub-parts being loaded
into PostGIS. This query looking for Golden, CO returns two rows instead
of the expected one.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_id, osm_type, boundary, admin_level, name, member_ids
    FROM osm.place_polygon p
    WHERE p.name = 'Golden'
    ORDER BY osm_id;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the the <code>osm_id</code> in the second row is listed in the
<code>member_ids</code> column of the first row.  The negative ID value
(<code>osm_id = -112204</code>) indicates that row is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/112204">a relation</a>
while the other is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/33113240">a way</a>.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

</code></pre>
<p>The legacy osm2pgsql process did not make it easy to remove the component
geometries, at least not that I found. When using this data for
analysis, this resulted in duplication that generally required manual cleanup.</p>
<p>The <code>member_ids</code> column shown above is pulled in during osm2pgsql processing
by the <a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/place.lua">place.lua</a> style. The tables get a new column defined:</p>
<pre><code>{ column = 'member_ids', type = 'jsonb'},
</code></pre>
<p>The processing uses the <code>way_member_ids()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>local member_ids = osm2pgsql.way_member_ids(object)
</code></pre>
<p>The associated post-processing SQL script
(<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/place.sql">place.sql</a>) creates a view <code>osm.places_in_relations</code> that is then
used to create the materialized view <code>osm.vplace_polygon</code>.</p>
<p>Querying <code>osm.vplace_polygon</code> only returns the one relation result for Golden, CO.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_id, osm_type, boundary, admin_level, name, member_ids
    FROM osm.vplace_polygon p
    WHERE p.name = 'Golden'
    ORDER BY osm_id;

<h2>Nested places</h2>
<p>Nested places refers to administrative boundaries that are contained, or 
contain, other administrative boundaries. An example of this is the
State of Colorado contains the boundary for Jefferson County, Colorado.
Determining these hierarchical structures can be accomplished in PostGIS using 
spatial joins, using
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Contains.html"><code>ST_Contains()</code></a>
or
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html"><code>ST_Within()</code></a>.
An example of a query using <code>ST_Within</code>() is below.</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
SELECT cn.*
    FROM osm.vplace_polygon st -- State  
    INNER JOIN osm.vplace_polygon cn -- County
        ON ST_Within(cn.geom, st.geom) AND cn.admin_level::INT = 6
    WHERE st.name = 'Colorado'
;
</code></pre>
<p>My laptop runs this query in 57 ms (22 ms planning + 54 ms execution).
The <code>EXPLAIN</code> <a href="https://explain.depesz.com/s/PK9V">output shows</a>
the spatial index scan is the most time consuming step, taking more than 40 ms.</p>
<pre><code>Index Scan using gix_osm_vplace_polygon ... (actual time=3.497..43.628 rows=69 loops=1)
</code></pre>
<p>A screenshot to visualize the results from the above query because
pictures are nice.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot from DBeaver showing the Colorado county polygons in blue over the Stamen Mono basemap." src="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/static/images/osm-counties-in-colorado-stamen-mono-basemap.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:  An astute reader may notice the <code>name</code> column is not indexed, indicated by the <code>Seq Scan</code> portion of the plan.  The <code>Seq Scan</code> took 9 ms, replacing it with an index scan reduced that step (and the overall query) by only 4-5 ms.  As the next section shows, this still falls short on performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Prepare the nested data</h3>
<p>The nested data is in the table <code>osm.place_polygon_nested</code> but does not have the nesting details calculated during the main processing steps.
The columns <code>nest_level</code>, <code>name_path</code>, <code>osm_id_path</code> and <code>admin_level_path</code>
are all <code>NULL</code> to start, and the <code>row_innermost</code> and <code>innermost</code> columns are all
<code>False</code>.</p>
<p>The procedure
(<code>osm.build_nested_admin_polygons()</code>) is created but not executed by
default with the PgOSM-Flex scripts.
This process runs really fast on small regions (e.g. Colorado) but can take quite a while (&gt; 1 hour) on larger regions (Europe).
Due to the non-negligible processing time on large regions, and the fact
that not everyone will use this data, I decided to skip this in the default processing for now.</p>
<p>Log into the <code>pgosm</code> database and run the procedure:</p>
<pre><code>CALL osm.build_nested_admin_polygons();
</code></pre>
<p>This calculates the nesting of each row in small batches, default batch size 100. After each batch runs it is committed.
Once all rows have processed, the final steps calculate a boolean <code>innermost</code> 
column to easily identify boundaries
that do not contain other boundaries, e.g. the narrowest, most …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

<p>After a decade of fierce rivalry with China's technology giant Huawei, Europe's telecoms equipment champions Nokia and Ericsson could soon face myriad new competitors to contend with.</p>



<p>As Europe cuts back on using Huawei equipment in its 5G networks, mobile operators are looking far and wide for companies to replace it. The Continent's "big four" telcos Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, Vodafone and Orange on Wednesday <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">published</a> a joint "<a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20/POLITICO-Memorandum-of-Understanding-OPEN-RAN-big-four-operators-January-2021.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a>" pledging to prioritize the development of "Open RAN" technology, a concept that would benefit smaller equipment and software makers.</p>



<p>Open RAN encompasses the idea of chopping up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and imposing standards on equipment and software firms so their products can work together — a "Lego approach," as one expert called it, to digital infrastructure. It would allow operators to procure specialized kit and services in smaller contracts with different players to piece together a 5G network, breaking the market power of “end-to-end” vendors like Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The operators' public campaign in favor of the standards comes after years of lobbying against 5G security laws that will significantly decrease Huawei's market presence in Europe in coming years. The operators, now barred by governments from using Huawei in several European markets, see Open RAN as a fix to what they consider a duopoly in the vendor market that allows Ericsson and Nokia to charge higher prices for 5G equipment.</p>



<p>Once in place, Open RAN could help equipment makers like South Korea’s Samsung and Japan’s NEC, cloud providers and tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft as well as smaller, specialized software companies like Altiostar and Mavenir gain a stronger foothold in Europe’s growing 5G market.</p>



<p>The big four operators said they'd also "promote to European policymakers and industry that adopting a competitive Open RAN ecosystem will place Europe and European industry at the front in the race of technological leadership."</p>



<p>But for the two European leading vendors, Ericsson and Nokia, the political push to boost new competitors could put more strain on already-narrow profit margins and troubled financials.</p>



<h3>Geopolitics of standards</h3>



<p>Operators across the world in 2018 started working on new standards in an association called the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org/about" target="_blank">O-RAN Alliance</a>. It's a standard-setting body that includes participants from more than 200 companies across the tech sector, including Microsoft, Facebook, chipmakers, software firms and Europe's leading vendors Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The O-RAN Alliance includes Chinese operators but not its tech giant Huawei — which is telling. </p>



<p>The Chinese giant has always perceived Open RAN as a challenge to its dominance: "O-RAN is currently hijacked for geo-political reasons. It's been weaponized, specifically against Huawei," a company official said in a conversation in June, requesting not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p>



<p>The push for Open RAN standards quickly gained pace in the U.S., where lawmakers realized the country's technology industry had missed the boat on developing 5G equipment.</p>



<p>U.S. Congress in November <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201118/policy/house-unanimously-passes-750-million-open-ran-5g-bill" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> approving $750 million in public funding to develop Open RAN technologies.   </p>



<p>The U.S. tech industry has also been leaning on European capitals through a lobby group called the <a href="https://www.openranpolicy.org/about-us/members/" target="_blank">Open RAN Policy Coalition</a>, formed in May last year. It gathers smaller U.S. software firms like Altiostar and Mavenir with household names like Cisco and Juniper and tech giants Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Intel and others. Non-U.S. names include Samsung, NEC, Fujitsu, Rakuten, as well as Europe's three largest telecoms operators and Nokia.</p>



<p>"One thing we've heard from European governments ... is that a diverse ecosystem is very important and they want to see that European vendors have a share of the market," said Alex Botting, senior director at Venable, a lobby firm that represents the coalition in talks with European authorities. </p>



<p>In London, the initiative got backing from the government when it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1532681">presented</a> its "diversification strategy" in November. It pledged £250 million in funding to boost innovation in Open RAN and try to introduce new, smaller 5G equipment makers. It also pledged to fund a new trial with Japanese telecoms vendor NEC.</p>



<h3>Europe's gain, Europe's loss</h3>



<p>For European lawmakers, the question is which specific European companies would gain from Open RAN — besides the operators that expect it to bring down procurement prices.</p>



<p>The concept comes with risks to its own leaders in the field, Ericsson and Nokia, who increasingly have free range in markets that have blocked or are shunning Chinese vendors. </p>



<p>"If you break that duopoly and you have lots of new suppliers, what does that do to the two European incumbents?" said Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer at global telecoms operators association GSMA.</p>



<p>Nokia has arguably been more receptive to the idea of Open RAN, but Ericsson has been lukewarm. </p>



<p>Its Chief Technology Officer Erik Ekudden said <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">in an interview in July</a> that the technology was still&nbsp;“maturing.” He said the telecoms network market was already open for competitors to try and enter, but few had succeeded because it's a tough market. “We have a consolidated market, we have relatively few radio access network vendors … But it’s still an extremely competitive market,” Ekudden said.  </p>



<p>Lawmakers in Europe have still sought to diversify telecoms vendors as part of the EU's "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123" target="_blank">5G security toolbox</a>" process that aimed to decrease the dependency on Huawei. </p>



<p>Regulators, lawmakers and industry officials are exploring policy options to soften the blow of phasing out Huawei, in working groups within the EU's digital services department as well as in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/nis-cooperation-group" target="_blank">NIS Cooperation Group</a>, a roundtable of cybersecurity experts of EU countries and the Commission.</p>



<p>In Berlin, the government also expressed support for Open RAN in recent updates of telecoms security rules, and operators have launched <a href="https://uk.nec.com/en_GB/press/202012/global_20201216_01.html" target="_blank">pilot projects</a> with new vendors already. </p>



<h3>Technical challenges ahead</h3>



<p>Above all, the operators' document Wednesday is a signal to both the industry's supply chain and the regulators overseeing it that they take Open RAN seriously.</p>



<p>In the document, they pledged to work together on Open RAN standards, invest in developing the technology and push governments and regulators to contribute research funding and “policy support.”</p>



<p>The four telcos, together with U.S. and Chinese counterparts like AT&amp;T, Verizon, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom and others, buy the most network equipment. A choice for a certain technology is certain to spur research by suppliers in coming years, and that could speed up the process to get large Open RAN networks up and running. </p>



<p>"Left to its natural course, this would probably take many years to become significant," said GSMA's Sinclair, adding that operators' public support "is all about accelerating this."</p>



<p>But running a network of smaller building blocks also increases technical headaches, he said: "If you're dealing with smaller suppliers, you have quite a lot of procurement problems," adding Open RAN networks would need a "system integrator" company to manage all the different parts — a role that operators in past decades have sourced out to vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>

          <p>
          
            Sun Jan 24 2021
          
          </p><p>The year is 2021.
The world has been transformed into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
COVID-19 has been cured,
but one of the vaccines went horribly awry:
some of the people who got the Oxford-Zeneca vaccine started
frothing at the mouth,
indiscriminately biting people,
and chanting <em>"Volker Halbach, Volker Halbach"</em>
before succumbing to their lack of qualia.</p>
<p>Two back-to-back pandemics were too much for the world to handle,
and the remnants of humanity have been reduced to
scavenging for GrabFood discounts.</p>
<p>But there is hope. A new screening test has been devised:
a perfect test that can detect for sure
whether someone has the virus in a matter of seconds...</p>
<hr>
<p>You are an overworked civil servant at the Ministry of Health.
Your boss comes in one day
brandishing a couple of important-looking documents.</p>
<p>"New directive from the Minister---we need
to test every traveler that comes in to the country.
Can you write me a proposal by today?"</p>
<p>What choice do you have? You get to work.</p>
<h2 id="0.-the-basic-one">0. The basic one</h2>
<p>The proposal goes something like this:
All visitors to the country will line up at a testing booth.
When it's their turn they'll spit in a cup
and then their secretion will be tested for the virus.
If they test negative, they're free to go;
if they test positive, they're whisked away
to a quarantine facility <s>never to be seen again</s>.
You bang it all out and send it to your boss.</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/queue.png" alt="How to test travelers"></p>
<p>You get a call the next day.
Your boss is aghast.</p>
<p>"We haven't got nearly enough tests
to test everyone who comes!" he shouts.</p>
<p>"Can we order more tests?" you ask.</p>
<p>"No, the whole world is out of tests."</p>
<p>You take a deep breath to calm yourself.</p>
<p>"The Minister wants us to test everybody that comes in, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But we don't have enough tests to test everybody?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>A few choice words come to mind, but you (wisely) stay silent.</p>
<p>If your boss had any shame he'd have the courtesy
to at least <em>look</em> sheepish,
but unfortunately all senior civil servants have had that
part of the brain surgically excised.
In any case, he wants you to come up with a new proposal.
"Can you find some way to test everyone, but with fewer tests?
As few as possible?"
You try to say something noncommittal but he's already hung up.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clumps of your hair lie morosely on the table.</p>
<p>Testing everyone without enough tests for everyone?
How is that possible?</p>
<p>You review the evidence.
Preliminary findings suggest that
out of every 1000 people,
roughly 3 people will have the virus.
Also, the test is perfectly accurate and infinitely-sensitive,
which means that it always gives the right answer,
and we can test as many people as we want with one test.
(Since the test is infinitely-sensitive, you can test the tiniest
drop of a person's spit, and it will give you the right answer).</p>
<p>Then you have a flash of insight:</p>

<p>Let's make one small change to the protocol.
Visitors will have to queue-up-and-spit---just as before---but
now TWO visitors will spit in one cup.
This combined cup will then be sent for testing.
Because the test is infinitely sensitive, it will test
positive if either (or both) of the visitors have the virus.
If the combined test comes back negative, then neither visitor
has the virus, and they are free to go.
If it comes back positive, then at least one of the pair has the virus.
We then test each of them individually.</p>
<p>This two-visitors-one-cup protocol will save almost half
of the tests because most of the tests will come out negative.
Why is this so?
The key here is that <strong>most travelers don't have the virus.</strong></p>
<p>Let's use an example to illustrate.</p>
<p>Suppose we have 1,000 travelers and 3 of them have the virus. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
If you test them individually then you will use up 1,000 tests.
If you pair them up at random, however, one of the following
must be the case:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are three pairs with one positive person,
and 497 all-negative pairs.</li>
<li>There is one pair with two positive people,
one pair of one pair with one positive person,
and 498 all-negative pairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first case,
we will use 500 tests for each of the pairs.
Three of those tests will come out positive and we will use
an additional two tests for each of them.
The total number of tests is
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>500</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>506</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">500 + 3*2 = 506</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>In the second,
we will again use 500 tests for each of the pairs,
and use two additional tests for each of the two positive pairs,
for a total of
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>500</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>504</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">500 + 2*2 = 504</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>In either case, we've cut the number of tests needed by almost half!
This method only works because most travelers are negative,
and so most pairs will test negative.
By contrast, if the infection rate was much higher
and 800 out of every 1000 people had the virus then
almost all of the pairs would test positive
and you would do better just testing everyone individually.</p>

<p>If two is good, surely three is better, four even better,
and ten double-plus-good better?
We'll divide travelers into groups---of, say, ten---
and get them all to spit into the cup.
Doing so could save us even more
tests if most visitors don't have the virus.
Assuming we only have three visitors with the virus
out of our 1000 visitors,
there can be at most three positive groups <em>no matter the group size.</em>
Doing groups of 10 would mean at most thirty individual tests,
for an upper bound of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>100</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>10</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>130</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">100 + (3*10) = 130</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests.</p>
<p>But of course, there's an upper bound to how many people you can
put in a group.
If you get all 1,000 people to spit into the same bucket (yucks) and test <em>that</em>
you'll only have to do one combined test,
but that test is definitely going to come out positive
and you're going to have to test all 1,000 people individually.
Then you haven't saved any tests at all.</p>
<p>We can calculate the optimal size for each group.
The trade-off of having bigger groups
is that you do fewer group tests that combine multiple people,
but have to do more individual tests when a combined test comes back positive.
Let's introduce some notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of total people = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of infected = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of groups = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of people in each partition = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N/G = p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the worst case you have to do <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>∗</mo><mi>min</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>K</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G + (p * \min(K, G))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests.</p>
<p>Why is this so?
In the first step you need to test the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> groups.
And in the worst case, all <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> of the groups will come out positive
(ergo each positive group has exactly one positive person),
and you'll have to test each of those <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> groups individually
which takes <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests each.</p>
<p>We can prove by differentiation
that the optimal number of people in each partition,
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p^{*}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, is given by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">∗</mo></msup><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mfrac><mi>N</mi><mi>k</mi></mfrac></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p^{*} = \sqrt{\frac{N}{k}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Using our example of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N=1000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K=3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
this would mean that the optimal group size is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mn>333</mn></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{333}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
which is something like 18.5. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> If we use <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p = 20</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> instead
(just so the numbers are easier to work with)
you would need <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>110</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50 + (3*20) = 110</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests at most
in the worst case, where you do 50 combined tests,
then test the 3 positive groups of 20 individually.</p>
<p>That's quite a big reduction.
By grouping people together into larger groups and testing those groups
we can decrease the number of tests needed by almost 90%,
from 1,000 to around 100.</p>
<p>You sketch out a diagram of how this larger group test approach works
and email it to your boss.
He makes a couple of quick scribbles on it
and it's quickly distributed to Border Control:</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/group_test_base_2.png" alt="Handout to ministry workers"></p>
<p>For a while, all is well.
You've done the impossible with your great leap of insight
and your boss gives you an A in your performance appraisal.
Your meteoric rise through the ranks of the Civil Service
is all but assured, you think to yourself -- but alas,
Fate is never so kind...</p>
<hr>
<p>A few months later, you enter the office and find it in a
state of upheaval.</p>
<p>It is pandemonium.
Your colleagues are screaming, jumping on desks,
and smashing file cabinets:
files and papers litter the floor,
and your Director is bawling his eyes out.</p>
<p>"What happened here?" you ask,
and in between racking sobs he points to a
stack of papers on his desk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Digital Government Blueprint
and the continuing economic difficulties
caused by the post-pandemic pandemic,
we call upon the Whole-of-Government
to embark upon a Productivity Improvement and Digitisation Journey
to increase WoG efficiency and reduce government expenditure...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lesser men would have gotten hopelessly lost
in the thick thicket of Bureaucrat-ease,
but you realise the subtext immediately.
In order for your boss to keep his year-end bonus
all his charges must demonstrate a 25% efficiency increase
---which means <em>you</em> have to reduce the number of tests by 25%.</p>
<p>(At this point the reader might wonder if a fairly mundane requirement
of a efficiency increase could lead to such an exaggerated scene.
I congratulate such a reader for his good fortune not to have worked
in the Civil Service).</p>
<p>You steal a furtive glance at your boss.
He seems to have recovered very quickly
and is now eyeing you expectantly.
You try to tell him that you've <em>already</em> saved him 90% of tests
but he's having none of it.
He quickly shoos you out of his office,
leaving you once again to do the seemingly impossible...</p>
<hr>

<p>Your most recent proposal is to test groups of 20.
If any group's test comes back positive,
test every single person in that group.
But must we test everyone individually once a group tests positive?
Can't we group people together again into subgroups of, say, 5?
And if that subgroup tests positive, can't we group people together <em>again</em>?
And so on.
After all, if we were able to save tests by
splitting our original group of 1000 into sub-groups,
maybe we can save even more tests by
splitting our sub-groups into sub-subgroups etc.</p>
<p>Here's an example. We have a group of 20 that tested positive.
We might then choose subgroups of 5 from that 20,
and start testing the first subgroup of 5.
If <em>that</em> subgroup tests positive we then split them
<em>again</em> into sub-subgroups of 2 and 3, and if those sub-subgroups
test positive we test them individually.
As before, if any group/subgroup/subsubgroup... tests negative
then we simply move on to the next one.</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/breadth_first_search_2.png" alt="Breadth-first search"></p>
<p>Does this actually save us tests?
Let's think about how many tests we would use in the worst case.
The worst case is when the positive tests are as
"spread out" …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/apple">Apple</a> issued further warning stating that the additional magnets in <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/iphone12">iPhone 12</a>, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, also, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/magsafe">MagSafe</a> accessories pose a risk to people with pacemakers and defibrillators.</p>
<p>Apple had previously accepted that the tendency for the magnets to interfere with some implanted medical equipment, however, the company, now, has going further to explain the risk attached, then offering advice. Apple advised that distancing is of importance, most especially while charging wirelessly.</p>
<p>Not too long ago in October 2020 — coinciding with the release of its new phones — Apple made mention that there’s a risk of electromagnetic interference with some medical devices. The company, now, has finally updated the earlier issued support document which warned of the risks to give further advice.</p>

<p>Apple has, particularly, now provided more information on how far to distant iPhone and MagSafe accessories from sensitive medical devices.</p>

<p>This updated advice came after a report which was published in the Heart Rhythm Journal had warned of the danger from latest generation iPhone 12 “which can potentially subdue lifesaving therapy in a patient especially while placing the phone in upper pockets” .</p>
<p>Please find full text of the support document below:</p>
<p><strong>“About the magnets inside iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and MagSafe accessories</strong></p>
<p><em>iPhone contains magnets as well as components and radios that emit electromagnetic fields. All MagSafe accessories (each sold separately) also contain magnets — and MagSafe Charger and MagSafe Duo Charger contain radios. These magnets and electromagnetic fields might interfere with medical devices.</em></p>
<p><em>Though all iPhone 12 models contain more magnets than prior iPhone models, they’re not expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference to medical devices than prior iPhone models.</em></p>
<p><em>Medical devices such as implanted pacemakers and defibrillators might contain sensors that respond to magnets and radios when in close contact. To avoid any potential interactions with these devices, keep your iPhone and MagSafe accessories a safe distance away from your device (more than 6 inches / 15 cm apart or more than 12 inches / 30 cm apart if wirelessly charging). But consult with your physician and your device manufacturer for specific guidelines.</em></p>
<p><em>Consult your physician and medical device manufacturer for information specific to your medical device and whether you need to maintain a safe distance of separation between your medical device and iPhone or any MagSafe accessories. Manufacturers often provide recommendations on the safe use of their devices around wireless or magnetic products to prevent possible interference. If you suspect iPhone or any MagSafe accessories are interfering with your medical device, stop using your iPhone or MagSafe accessories.</em></p>
<p><em>We provide more information on safety at <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ng/guide/iphone/iph301fc905/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Important safety information</a> for iPhone in the iPhone User Guide.</em>”</p>

<p>Be safe…</p>

      <p>Send a simple email</p> 
      <p>Ogham provides a single entry point (<code>MessagingService</code>) to send any message. To send an email, just prepare the email content using the <code>Email</code> class. The fluent API lets you chain API calls and also helps to guide developers.</p> 
      <p>In standalone mode (without framework integration), <code>MessagingService</code> has to be instantiated. In this sample, the predefined behavior is used. The properties are used to configure the SMTP protocol/implementation.</p>

      <p>Send using a template</p> 
      <p>In real world applications, messages content need to be constructed with variable parts. That’s why Ogham provides integration with several templating engines.</p> 
      <p>The only difference here is the use of <code>TemplateContent</code> instead of a string. This indicates to Ogham that the content is a template to evaluate.</p> 
      <p>The template is located in the classpath (use of <code>classpath:</code>). The template contains variables (<code>name</code> and <code>value</code>). To evaluate the template, a model is needed to provide values for <code>name</code> and <code>value</code>. In the example, the class <code>SimpleBean</code> is defined with the properties and used as model.</p> 
      <p>Templates can be used for SMS or whatever in the same way.</p> 
      <p>In the sample, Thymeleaf template engine is used but it could be any template engine.</p>

<p>
The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.
</p>
<p>
This book is my attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive introduction to graph representation learning, including methods for embedding graph data, graph neural networks, and deep generative models of graphs.

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>2020 was an intense year. I hope you're healthy and keep being healthy. I am privileged (as lots of software engineers and academics are) to be able to work from home during the pandemic. Let's not forget people in less privileged situations,  and let’s try to give them as much practical, psychological and financial support as we can these days. And as much joy as possible to everyone around :)</p>
<p>I cancelled the autumn MirageOS retreat due to the pandemic. Instead I collected donations for our hosts in Marrakech - they were very happy to receive our financial support, since they had a difficult year, since their income is based on tourism. I hope that in autumn 2021 we'll have an on-site retreat again.</p>
<p>For 2021, we (at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a>) got a grant from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS" (more details below), and another grant from <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml software foundation</a> for securing the opam supply chain (using <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a>). Some long-awaited releases for MirageOS libraries, namely a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">ssh implementation</a> and a rewrite of our <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git implementation</a> have already been published.</p>
<p>With my MirageOS view, 2020 was a pretty successful year, where we managed to add more features, fixed lots of bugs, and paved the road ahead. I want to thank <a href="https://ocamllabs.io/">OCamlLabs</a> for funding work on MirageOS maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="Recap-2020">Recap 2020</h2>

<p>Here is a very subjective random collection of accomplishments in 2020, where I was involved with some degree.</p>
<h3 id="NetHSM">NetHSM</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nethsm">NetHSM</a> is a hardware security module in software. It is a product that uses MirageOS for security, and is based on the <a href="https://muen.sk/">muen</a> separation kernel. We at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a> were heavily involved in this product. It already has been security audited by an external team. You can pre-order it from Nitrokey.</p>
<h3 id="TLS-1-3">TLS 1.3</h3>

<p>Dating back to 2016, at the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2016/tron-workshop-programme/">TRON</a> (TLS 1.3 Ready or NOt), we developed a first draft of a 1.3 implementation of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls">OCaml-TLS</a>. Finally in May 2020 we got our act together, including ECC (ECDH P256 from <a href="https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto/">fiat</a>, X25519 from <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">hacl</a>) and testing with <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer">tlsfuzzer</a>, and release tls 0.12.0 with TLS 1.3 support. Later we added <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ECC ciphersuites to TLS version 1.2</a>, implemented <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ChaCha20/Poly1305</a>, and fixed an <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/424">interoperability issue with Go's implementation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto">Mirage-crypto</a> provides the underlying cryptographic primitives, initially released in March 2020 as a fork of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto">nocrypto</a> -- huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pqwy">pqwy</a> for his great work. Mirage-crypto detects <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/53">CPU features at runtime</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Julow">Julow</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/96">bugfix for bswap</a>), using constant time modular exponentation (powm_sec) and hardens against Lenstra's CRT attack, supports <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/39">compilation on Windows</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/avsm">avsm</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/90">async entropy harvesting</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/seliopou">seliopou</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/65">32 bit support</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/72">chacha20/poly1305</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abeaumont">abeaumont</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/84">cross-compilation</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EduardoRFS">EduardoRFS</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/78">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/81">bug</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/83">fixes</a>, even <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/95">memory leak</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/talex5">talex5</a> for reporting several of these issues), and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/99">RSA</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/100">interoperability</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/psafont">psafont</a> for investigation and <a href="https://github.com/mattjbray">mattjbray</a> for reporting). This library feels very mature now - being used by multiple stakeholders, and lots of issues have been fixed in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="Qubes-Firewall">Qubes Firewall</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/">MirageOS based Qubes firewall</a> is the most widely used MirageOS unikernel. And it got major updates: in May <a href="https://github.com/linse">Steffi</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-users/c/Xzplmkjwa5Y">announced</a> her and <a href="https://github.com/yomimono">Mindy's</a> work on improving it for Qubes 4.0 - including <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-interface/#firewall-rules-in-4x">dynamic firewall rules via QubesDB</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/portable-firewall-fuer-qubesos/">prototypefund</a> for sponsoring.</p>
<p>In October 2020, we released <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-39-release">Mirage 3.9</a> with PVH virtualization mode (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mato">mato</a>). There's still a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/issues/120">memory leak</a> to be investigated and fixed.</p>
<h3 id="IPv6">IPv6</h3>

<p>In December, with <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-310-release">Mirage 3.10</a> we got the IPv6 code up and running. Now MirageOS unikernels have a dual stack available, besides IPv4-only and IPv6-only network stacks. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nojb">nojb</a> for the initial code and <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS">MagnusS</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out this blog, but also robur services, are now available via IPv6 :)</p>
<h3 id="Albatross">Albatross</h3>

<p>Also in December, I pushed an initial release of <a href="https://github.com/roburio/albatross">albatross</a>, a unikernel orchestration system with remote access. <em>Deploy your unikernel via a TLS handshake -- the unikernel image is embedded in the TLS client certificates.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/reynir">reynir</a> for statistics support on Linux and improvements of the systemd service scripts. Also thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cfcs">cfcs</a> for the initial Linux port.</p>
<h3 id="CA-certs">CA certs</h3>

<p>For several years I postponed the problem of how to actually use the operating system trust anchors for OCaml-TLS connections. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/emillon">emillon</a> for initial code, there are now <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs">ca-certs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs-nss">ca-certs-nss</a> opam packages (see <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ca-certs-and-ca-certs-nss">release announcement</a>) which fills this gap.</p>
<h2 id="Unikernels">Unikernels</h2>

<p>I developed several useful unikernels in 2020, and also pushed <a href="https://mirage.io/wiki/gallery">a unikernel gallery</a> to the Mirage website:</p>
<h3 id="Traceroute-in-MirageOS">Traceroute in MirageOS</h3>

<p>I already wrote about <a href="https://hannes.robur.coop/Posts/Traceroute">traceroute</a> which traces the routing to a given remote host.</p>
<h3 id="Unipi-static-website-hosting">Unipi - static website hosting</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/roburio/unipi">Unipi</a> is a static site webserver which retrieves the content from a remote git repository. Let's encrypt certificate provisioning and dynamic updates via a webhook to be executed for every push.</p>
<h4 id="TLSTunnel-TLS-demultiplexing">TLSTunnel - TLS demultiplexing</h4>

<p>The physical machine this blog and other robur infrastructure runs on has been relocated from Sweden to Germany mid-December. Thanks to UPS! Fewer IPv4 addresses are available in the new data center, which motivated me to develop <a href="https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel">tlstunnel</a>.</p>
<p>The new behaviour is as follows (see the <code>monitoring</code> branch):</p>
<ul><li>listener on TCP port 80 which replies with a permanent redirect to <code>https</code></li><li>listener on TCP port 443 which forwards to a backend host if the requested server name is configured</li><li>its configuration is stored on a block device, and can be dynamically changed (with a custom protocol authenticated with a HMAC)</li><li>it is setup to hold a wildcard TLS certificate and in DNS a wildcard entry is pointing to it</li><li>setting up a new service is very straightforward: only the new name needs to be registered with tlstunnel together with the TCP backend, and everything will just work</li></ul>

<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>

<p>The year started with a release of <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">awa</a>, a SSH implementation in OCaml (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haesbaert">haesbaert</a> for initial code). This was followed by a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git 3.0 release</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dinosaure">dinosaure</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Deploying-MirageOS-NGI-Pointer">Deploying MirageOS - NGI Pointer</h3>

<p>For 2021 we at robur received funding from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS", which boils down into three parts:</p>
<ul><li>reproducible binary releases of MirageOS unikernels,</li><li>monitoring (and other devops features: profiling) and integration into existing infrastructure,</li><li>and further documentation and advertisement.</li></ul>

<p>Of course this will all be available open source. Please get in touch via eMail (team aT robur dot coop) if you're eager to integrate MirageOS unikernels into your infrastructure.</p>
<p>We discovered at an initial meeting with an infrastructure provider that a DNS resolver is of interest - even more now that dnsmasq suffered from <a href="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DNSpooq_Technical-Whitepaper.pdf">dnspooq</a>. We are already working on an <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/pull/251">implementation of DNSSec</a>.</p>
<p>MirageOS unikernels are binary reproducible, and <a href="https://github.com/rjbou/orb/pull/1">infrastructure tools are available</a>. We are working hard on a web interface (and REST API - think of it as "Docker Hub for MirageOS unikernels"), and more tooling to verify reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="Conex-securing-the-supply-chain">Conex - securing the supply chain</h3>

<p>Another funding from the <a href="http://ocaml-sf.org/">OCSF</a> is to continue development and deploy <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a> - to bring trust into opam-repository. This is a great combination with the reproducible build efforts, and will bring much more trust into retrieving OCaml packages and using MirageOS unikernels.</p>
<h3 id="MirageOS-4-0">MirageOS 4.0</h3>

<p>Mirage so far still uses ocamlbuild and ocamlfind for compiling the virtual machine binary. But the switch to dune is <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1195">close</a>, a lot of effort has been done.

	<div>
		<p>There is a book by Wall Street Journal reporter Zuckerman, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X">The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution</a>, about James Harris Simons–a former mathematician, physicist, and code breaker–who launched arguably the most successful hedge fund ever, Renaissance Technologies, which for decades has posted annual returns in excess of 40%,  making it by far the most successful hedge fund ever. Equally impressive is that in the nearly 40 years of its existence, Renaissance has never had a down year. Unfortunately but understandably, Harris’ methodology of how he ‘solved’ Wall Street remains opaque in spite of intense interest and sleuthing online, but one can infer that it involves various ‘statistical methods,’ which is still hopelessly vague but the best we can infer with the information Zuckerman and others have supplied.</p>
<p>But move over Harris, because there is a cadre of traders who also appear to have ‘solved the market,’ but unlike Harris, they make their trades openly public for ‘bragging rights’ and ‘meme value.’ But Renaissance Technologies is in a league of its own in terms of uninterrupted, smooth returns, but in terms of absolute returns, especially at an endeavor in which so few beat the market, these new traders possibly have him beat. </p>
<p>But let’s go back  a bit in history. For years, probably as far back as the late ’90s, message boards and blogs dominated online financial discourse. Then came Twitter, along with YouTube, creating new avenues for traders share wins, losses, and strategies . Sites such as StockTwits, which leveraged the Twitter platform and popularized ‘dollar hashtags’ (such as $AAPL for Apple), grew in popularity. By 2013-2015 or so, at its peak, the ‘finance sphere’ was composed of YouTube channels (such as Tasty Trade, which makes me cringe just typing it out), blogs (such as Seeking Alpha, which aggregates many blogs, and also individually-run blogs), popular message boards (such as Elite Trader and Yahoo Finance message boards), StockTwits (which still exists but is full of ads and is a shadow of its former popularity, having been subsumed by Twitter), trading podcasts, and also Reddit.  </p>
<p>Looking back, I only realize now that that all those platforms had one thing in common: no was actually making money . Except for proprietors of newsletters, as well as YouTube channels and blogs that collected ad revenue, the actual traders themselves tended to either lose money or make only table scraps. In spite of this torrent of content, the one thing everyone was ultimately seeking–profits–was out of reach or only a pittance.</p>
<p>Then in 2015, the Reddit sub /r/WallStreetBets changed all of that. Suddenly people were making money for a change, posting verifiable screenshots and video screenshot captures of substantial returns. In any given day, one can easily find many posts  of option traders turning thousands or even hundreds of dollars into <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8tbz0/recovered_4_months_40k_from_pltr_yolo/">tens</a> of thousand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63ykM9PBNK8&amp;feature=youtu.be">hundreds</a> of thousand, or even <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8n3io/1m_from_460_video_so_the_haters_among_you_dont/">millions</a> of dollars of profit. Other are making substantial, market-beating returns with ‘buy and hold,’ without options, which tend to be riskier than stocks but produce far greater returns. Of course, given the inherently risky nature of options and leverage, some traders on WallStreetBets also lose substantial sums of money (getting rekt, blowing up, or washed-out, as it’s called), posting screenshots of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8i3ko/105000_gone_in_30_days_fucked_myself_bigtime_on/">losses</a> in all their glory. One ‘degenerate’ [as part of the in-group culture and lingo, traders on WallStreetBets often refer to each other as degenerates or autists, which is not at all that inaccurate of a description], for example, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k30ty7/410k_of_losses_over_8_months/">lost</a> $400k on ill-timed Tesla options. In regard to the above links of massive wins, it is not like I am cherry-picking: all of these were selected within a single day, going no deeper than 2 pages within the sub. On any given day, one can easily find at least three or more screenshots and other documented evidence of substantial profits, all within the first page. </p>
<p>Memes and jokes aside, we’re talking big money. Millions of dollars is nothing to scoff at, especially given the statistically improbable and high frequency of such profitable trades, all fully disclosed to the public, and the inherent difficulty of trading and ‘beating the market,’ which is a goal retail speculators and institutional investors alike  aspire to but many fall short of, so seeing these ‘autists and degenerates’ post the sort of consistent returns that make Google salaries seem small by comparison, is bound to draw some attention. Consequently, after relative obscurity in 2015, WallStreetBets has exploded in popularity over the past few years as the Trump bull market and the even bigger bull market in tech stocks has enriched speculators greatly, and whipped people up into a get-rich-quick frenzy, and especially since Covid, as young people find themselves with ample free time and money (in spite of joblessness and ‘tough times’, there always seems to be money to trade).</p>
<p>So back to James Simmons, I believe, contrary to EMH purists, that actual trading ‘skill’ exists, and that returns comparable Renaissance Technologies, or even greater, are possible, and that there are traders on /r/WallStreetBets who are doing that now (sure, they do not have billions of dollars, but you have to start somewhere, and small, successful strategies can be scaled up). The common retort is that if losses and wins follow a normal distribution, then we would expect given a large enough pool of traders that some traders on the tail-end of the distribution will appear very successful and have a long string of big wins, by pure chance. Yet empirical observation seems to suggest otherwise.  Despite the large losses, it is evident some traders have a knack for making consistent, large profits, and that some strategies are superior to others, with far greater frequency that can be attributed by chance alone. Even if unsuccessful traders are disinclined to post their results on /r/WallStreetBets, there are enough large winning trades and successful traders, that we can infer such a strategy. Even hedge funds are taking notice , trying to elicit such tradable and replicable strategies and gems from the pile of memes and ‘shitposts’. </p>
<p>So why is WallStreetBets, large losses not withstanding, so successful , when all prior communities failed to deliver on actual profits? My belief, again deferring to HBD, is that the addition of 20 or more extra IQ points from the generally high-IQ Reddit community created superior strategies. The blogs and communities that predated WallStreetBets focused mostly on technical analysis (annotating stock charts with lines and diagrams to predict price direction) and small cap stocks (penny stocks are often very popular on stock massage boards and blogs, yet few people make money trading them), but those strategies are inferior to the strategies the successful traders on WallStreetBets employ. Eschewing technical analysis or small cap stocks, traders on WallStreetBets focus instead on dominant, big tech companies and employ a more holistic, fundamental approach and ignore chart patterns. Traders on WallStreetBets correctly deduced that the ‘easy money’ is made with $50-500+ billion companies such AMZN and TSLA, not small or medium-sized stocks, which tend to be more volatile and give up their gains too easily, whereas mega-cap tech stocks such as Tesla and Amazon hold their gains, have less volatility, and have superior absolute returns compared to smaller stocks despite being orders of magnitude bigger (Tesla stock, for example, despite being worth $600 billion , was up 700% for 2020). </p>
<p>A possible objection is that, sure, we can go back in time and find successes such as Tesla and Amazon, but how do we know this is not just luck, versus skill? Maybe they just got lucky in choosing those stocks and that the luck will run out. But consider the recent success of Palantir (PLTR). As soon as Palantir went public on September  30th, WallStreetBets traders immediately honed in on it and began buying. For example, one trader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3fdws/i_went_yolo_on_palantir_ipo_yesterday/">bought</a> shares as soon as it began trading, on the IPO, at what was then $9/share. Palantir, just 2 months later,  trades at  $27/share–a gain of 200%, far surpassing the S&amp;P 500, which was only up 15% year-to-date. Scanning the archives of WallStreetBets, one finds dozens of instances of traders speculating, correctly, that Palantir would go higher and profiting greatly by buying call options on Palantir or buying shares outright, typically on Robinhood. Many traders have made six figures in profit doing so.   So out of a pool of thousands of companies to choose from, WallStreetBets correctly singled out Palantir, one of the strongest-performing stocks of the past 2 months even before it it gained 200%. This is demonstrative of actual skill and not just guessing. </p>
<p>Hedge funds spend inordinate amounts of money hiring some of the smartest PHDs and other credentialed experts to find strategies that may give their funds even just a small edge over the S&amp;P 500 or some other benchmark, yet the retail traders on WallStreetBets appear to leave these experts in the dust. Sure, in fairness, hedge funds seek to minimize volatility whereas WallStreetBets  traders appear inured by the volatility that comes with trading highly speculative call options, yet it would at the same time seem as if they have found a strategy that otherwise was overlooked by the experts. The experts have been trying to time the bottom on value stocks and commodity stocks, for years, to no avail, but WallStreetBets traders chose growth, market dominance, and size over cheapness.  By possessing above-average IQs and a strong and reliable intuition about how the market works, WallStreetBets traders were able to ferret-out–much like how James Harris, who is a genius, was able to find winning strategies–that buying call options and or ‘buying and holding’ these handful of large, dominant tech …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>In the confusing jungle of transpiler languages for JavaScript, there are some gems. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> is mainstream, <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReScript</a> is starting to establish itself, and <a href="https://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elm</a> is still an insider tip. This article takes a detailed look at ReScript – but also sheds light on the limitations of the young language. In what projects does its use make sense? What projects should rather use TypeScript on the one hand or Elm on the other?</i></p><p>In web environments, nothing works without JavaScript. Not surprisingly, JavaScript is a popular <a href="http://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target language for transpilers</a> – compilers that do not convert to bytecode but into the source code of another language. Teams like to use transpiler languages such as TypeScript, ReScript, or Elm for their advantages like static typing, modern language features, or support for functional programming. Static typing and functional programming are of particular interest here.</p><h2>Static typing</h2><p>The topic of static typing is highly controversial and often leads to religious wars. A strong type system helps detect and avoid errors. But whether type checks should happen at runtime or at compile time is a matter of opinion. More objectively, there are arguments for both sides. Clear advantages of static type systems are</p><ul><li>early error detection (type safety)</li><li>auto-completion</li><li>documentation</li><li>optimizations</li></ul><h3>Type safety</h3><p>The costs for the removal of a defect depend on the moment of its discovery. If an error is discovered that has just occurred, it is usually quickly found and corrected. An error that a customer discovers months later in production often takes considerably more time to fix. Almost every experienced developer has an anecdote about how he or she spent three days looking for a bug.</p><p>Static typing helps detect certain error classes at an early stage and thus avoid efforts like debugging. Test-driven development (TDD) has the same effect. However, type safety and TDD address different error classes. A combination of both is desirable. The claim that static typing alone leads to less error-prone code is controversial – scientific studies have not been able to <a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prove it</a>.</p><h2>Auto-completion &amp; Documentation</h2><p>In many web projects it is not uncommon to constantly use new APIs from libraries or even other project teams. In this respect, a good autocomplete in the IDE can save a lot of time. Even without auto-completion, type specifications serve as documentation and help to understand functions faster.</p><h4>Optimization</h4><p>A compiler/transpiler that knows the type of a value can sometimes perform optimizations in the generated code that would otherwise not be possible.</p><h4>Costs of static typing</h4><p>On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the costs of static typing. These include:</p><ul><li>Code noise</li><li>additional effort due to type conversion</li><li>higher compiler runtimes</li><li>increased complexity</li></ul><h3>Code noise</h3><p>Code noise means that the readability of code can deteriorate significantly when many type annotations obscure the view. JavaScript blogger Eric Elliot calls this <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-typescript-tax-132ff4cb175b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript tax</a> and questions the return of investment of static type systems.</p><h3>Effort, complexity &amp; compilation time</h3><p><strong>Additional effort</strong> may be required if it is necessary to convert values into other types, e.g. to pass them to an external function. <strong>Long compilation times</strong> can cause developers to lose focus while waiting for the result of a change – a frustrating experience for experimental tasks. Finally, a static type system comes with its own set of concepts that need to be mastered – resulting in an <strong>increase in complexity</strong>.</p><h2>Exploiting the type system</h2><p>Since static type systems have advantages and disadvantages, there are two strategies:</p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The team forgoes a type system and thus the benefits, but also the costs – the language of choice is classic JavaScript or <a href="https://picostitch.com/blog/2020/05/12-typescript-for-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript without type annotations</a>. This option is often ridiculed, but it can be a legitimate choice. To ensure the quality of the software, high test coverage is even more important here.</p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> The team tries to exploit the type system as much as possible. That is, it is important to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages. Some features of the type system can help: Type inference and structural typing can minimize code noise and refactoring efforts. Discriminated unions help write code that is as error-free as possible and detect problems at compile time – more on this later.</p><h2>Functional programming</h2><p>An increasing number of JavaScript developers are discovering functional programming for themselves – libraries such as underscore, <a href="https://lodash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lodash</a> or <a href="https://ramdajs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RamdaJS</a> have long been favorites of many teams. The functional-inspired <em>React</em> is considered the most popular UI-framework and even the classic object-oriented <em>Angular</em> relies on a variant of functional programming in the form of <a href="https://rxjs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RxJS</a>. The strengths of functional programming include:</p><ul><li><strong>Immutable</strong> data structures</li><li>A <strong>stateless</strong> programming model</li><li>Simple <strong>composition</strong> of functions</li><li>Reduction of complexity</li></ul><p>One of the big problems of imperative programming is the so-called <em>Mutable State</em> – i.e. a state that can be changed. The fact that the state changes means that the code at runtime can differ significantly from the code that the IDE shows statically. As a result, a debugger is often required to understand what the code is doing in the first place. Functional programming minimizes the problem by avoiding mutable state. To ensure that this is possible in performant way, the language must be optimized for this, or the team uses an appropriate library, such as <a href="https://github.com/immerjs/immer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immer</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seamless-immutable</a>.</p><p>However, libraries can extend JavaScript only to a limited extent. Some concepts require direct language support.</p><h2>Transpiler languages</h2><p>Transpiler languages like TypeScript, ReScript, and Elm help by providing a static type system and support for functional concepts.</p><h2>TypeScript</h2><p>TypeScript hardly needs an introduction, as it is the most popular of the transpiler languages.

These include, among others:</p><ul><li>Structural typing and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">structural subtyping</a></li><li>An algebraic type system including <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#discriminating-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discriminated union types</a></li></ul><h3>Structural typing</h3><p>TypeScript relies on so-called <em>structural typing</em>, i. e. not the name of a type is relevant (<em>nominal typing</em>), but the structure. Here is an example:</p><div><pre>type Person = { firstName: string; lastName: string };
type User = { firstName: string; lastName: string };
type Dog = { firstName: string };

let person1: Person = { firstName: "Alice", lastName: "Foo" };
let user1: User = { firstName: "Bob", lastName: "Bar" };
let dog1: Dog = { firstName: "Wuffy" };

let greet1 = (person: Person) =&gt;`Hello ${person.firstName}`;

greet1(person1); //OK
greet1(user1);   //OK
greet1(dog1);    // =&gt; Error (as expected)</pre></div><p>This brings some advantages: converting a value to match the type is not necessary. As long as the structure is the same, TypeScript accepts the value. This is also a prerequisite for so-called <em>structural subtyping</em> – a concept similar to <em>duck typing</em> that is only available in dynamic languages:</p><div><div><pre>let greet2 = (person: { firstName: string }) =&gt;`Hello ${person.firstName}`;

greet2(person1); //OK
greet2(dog1);    //OK, the obj has prop "firstName"
greet2(27);      // =&gt; Error (as expected)</pre></div><p>Function <em>greet2</em> accepts any object as long as the subtype <em>“an object with firstName of type string”</em> is fulfilled. Whether or not the object has other properties, such as <em>lastName</em>, is irrelevant for the call of <em>greet2</em>.</p></div><h3>Discriminated union types</h3><p>To maximize the error detection of a type system, it is important to design types correctly: valid values must be representable in the type system, invalid ones must be rejected. Domain-driven design calls this <em>enforcing invariants</em> (see <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=Kq7YXEJnKH&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>). Of course, it is easy to code checks that enforce invariants at runtime. However, a good type system checks for invariants at compile time. Here&nbsp;an example with so-called <em>discriminated union types</em>:</p><div><pre>type Color = "green" | "red" | "blue";

type Circle = {
  kind: "Circle";
  radius: number;
};

type Rectangle = {
  kind: "Rectangle";
  height: number;
  width: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Rectangle;

let circle1: Shape = { kind: "Circle", radius: 10 };       //OK
let <em>rectangle1</em>: Shape = { kind: "Rectangle", radius: 10 }; //Error correctly detected
let <em>rectangle2</em> = { kind: "Rectangle", radius: 10 };        //OK, but should be an Error</pre></div><p>In the case of <em>color</em>, the union type still looks like a simple <em>enum</em>. However, <em>shape</em> should make clear that different variants of shapes can also bring different data. A shape here is either a circle or a rectangle. Circles have a <em>radius</em>, rectangles <em>height</em> and <em>width</em>. A rectangle must not have a <em>radius</em>.</p><p>If a value (here: the variable <em>rectangle1</em>) is marked as a shape, TypeScript can detect the error – in our case: rectangle with radius. Sidenote: <em>kind</em> is not a keyword of the language, any identifier is possible.</p><p>If the type annotation is missing, as is the case with <em>rectangle2</em>, the type system of TypeScript unfortunately fails to detect the error. TypeScript is considered <a href="http://logan.tw/posts/2014/11/12/soundness-and-completeness-of-the-type-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unsound</a>. ReScript goes a step further here and can detect the error with <em>rectangle2</em> using type inference – more about this later.</p><h3>AnyScript</h3><p>The TypeScript type system is particularly helpful for teams that have the discipline to type consistently. However, TypeScript also provides the ability to gradually type less. This is a useful feature for teams that plan to migrate existing JavaScript code to TypeScript piece by piece. The downside, however, is that it can cause the team to neglect typing. The temptation is always near to assign an <em>any</em> instead of a difficult type annotation or even to switch off the typing by means of an <em>@ts-ignore</em> comment.</p><p>What saves time at first usually takes its toll later on, namely when the compiler …</p></div></div>

				<p>Latches and barriers are coordination types that enable some threads to wait until a counter becomes zero. You can use a <code>std::latch</code> only once, but you can use a <code>std::barrier</code> more than once. Today, I have a closer look at latches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/TimelineCpp20.png" alt="TimelineCpp20" width="650" height="224"></p>
<p>Concurrent invocations of the member functions of a <code>std::latch</code> or a <code>std::barrier</code> are no data race. A data race is such a crucial term in concurrency that I want to write more words to it.</p>
<h2 id="h1-data-race">Data Race</h2>
<p>A data race is a situation, in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time and at least one thread tries to modify the variable. If your program has a data race, it has undefined behavior. This means all outcomes are possible and therefore, reasoning about the program makes no sense anymore.</p>
<p>Let me show you a program with a data race.</p>

<p>100 threads adding 50 euros to the same account (1) using the function <code>addMoney</code> (2). The initial account is 100 (3). The crucial observation is that the writing to the account is done without synchronization. Therefore&nbsp;we have a data race and, consequently, undefined behavior. The final balance is between 5000 and 5100 euro (4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/addMoney.png" alt="addMoney"></p>
<p>What is happening? Why are a few additions missing? The update process <code>to.balance <span>+=</span> amount; </code>in line (1) is a so-called read-modify-write operation. As such, first, the old value of <code>to.balance</code> is read, then it is updated, and finally is written. What may happen under the hood is the following. I use numbers to make my argumentation more obvious</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread A reads the value 500 euro and then Thread B kicks in.</li>
<li>Thread B read also the value 500 euro, adds 50 euro to it, and updates <code>to.balance</code> to 550 euro.</li>
<li>Now Thread A finished its execution by adding 50 euro to <code>to.balance</code> and also writes 550 euro.</li>
<li>Essential the value 550 euro is written twice and instead of two additions of 50 euro, we only observe one.</li>
<li>This means, that one modification is lost and we get the wrong final sum.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, there are two questions to answer before I present <code>std::latch</code> and <code>std::barrier</code> in detail.</p>
<h2 id="h2-two-questions">Two Questions<code><br></code></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the difference between these two mechanisms to coordinate threads?</strong> You can use a <code>std::latch</code> only once, but you can use a <code>std::barrier</code> more than once. A <code>std::latch</code> is useful for managing one task by multiple threads; a<code> std::barrier</code> is helpful for managing repeated tasks by multiple threads. Additionally, a <code>std::barrier</code> enables you to execute a function in the so-called completion step. The completion step is the state when the counter becomes zero.</li>
<li><strong>What use cases do latches and barriers support that cannot be done in C++11 with futures, threads, or condition variables combined with locks?</strong> Latches and barriers address no new use cases, but they are a lot easier to use. They are also more performant because they often use a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm">lock-free </a>mechanism internally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me continue my post with the simpler data type of both.</p>
<h2 id="h3-std-latch"><code>std::latch</code></h2>
<p>Now, let us have a closer look at the interface of a <code>std::latch</code>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/memberFunctionsLatch.png" alt="memberFunctionsLatch" width="600" height="161"></p>
<p>The default value for <code>upd</code> is <code>1</code>. When <code>upd</code> is greater than the counter or negative, the behavior is undefined. The call <code>lat.try_wait()</code> does never wait as its name suggests.</p>
<p>The following program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code> uses two <code>std::latch</code> to build a boss-workers workflow. I synchronized the output to <code>std::cout</code> using the function <code>synchronizedOut</code> (1). This synchronization makes it easier to follow the workflow.</p>

<p>The idea of the workflow is straightforward. The six workers <code>herb</code>, <code>scott</code>, <code>bjarne</code>, <code>andrei</code>, <code>andrew</code>, and <code>david</code> in the <code>main</code>-program have to fulfill their job. When they finished their job, they count down the <code>std::latch workDone</code> (2). The boss (<code>main</code>-thread) is blocked in line (3) until the counter becomes 0. When the counter is 0, the boss uses the second <code>std::latch goHome</code> to signal its workers to go home. In this case, the initial counter is <code>1</code> (4). The call g<code>oHome.wait</code> (5) blocks until the counter becomes 0.</p>

<p>When you think about this workflow, you may notice that it can be performed without a boss. Here is the modern variant:</p>

    andreiWork.join();
    andrewWork.join();
    davidWork.join();
  
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>There is not much to add to this simplified workflow. The call <code>workDone.arrive_and_wait(1)</code> (1) is equivalent to the calls <code>count_down(upd); wait();</code>. This means the workers coordinate themself and the boss is no longer necessary such as in the previous program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code>.</p>

<h2 id="h4-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>A <code>std::barrier </code>is quite similar to a <code>std::latch</code>. <code>std::barrier</code>'s strength is it to perform a job more than once. In my next post, I will have a closer look at barriers.</p>

				<div><p>Ah, Internet.</p><p>Feels like we're swimming in it these days. No wonder we take it for granted.</p><p>But like power, when it goes down, we get glimpses of medieval times where you couldn't get millions of answers to any question in milliseconds. Scary stuff.</p></div><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D62E29907FBE2CB91E90E5D06079CEBE537D2F35FA8BF216C789C2F625BF2361_1610813104092_what+is+the+meaning+of+life.jpg" alt=""></figure><div><p>I often have moments of metacognition when sending messages online. I'm baffled by all of the hardware and physics involved. We're having video calls in real-time with people thousands of miles away. All of that information is carried turbo fast through code, waves, light, cables?</p><p>WTF!</p><p>This post will un-WTF the Internet for you. Make you go from "this is sorcery" to "this is amazing".</p><p>So. You've heard of browsers and servers. Modems, routers, Wi-Fi, and the "cloud". You know the internet can be fast or slow. You can use it on your phone, your computer, your TV—often all at the same time.</p><p>Great. Now say I were to ask you: "describe the steps needed for a meme to go from one phone to another". You'd probably tell me to F off. Or use a shrug emoji. 🤷</p><p>We'll start our internet journey here then. With the sharing of a meme. Alice has this one saved in her phone:</p></div><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D62E29907FBE2CB91E90E5D06079CEBE537D2F35FA8BF216C789C2F625BF2361_1610814490690_i+have+no+idea+what+im+doing.jpg" alt=""></figure><div><p>She wants to share it with Bob, who loves memes. In the comfort of her living room, Alice unlocks her iPhone and accesses her images folder.</p><p>(There's a S ton of things happening just there, which I'll cover in an upcoming "How code works" post. Let's focus on that internet for now).</p><p>She opens the file, hits "share via Messenger". A chat app overlays her screen, she selects Bob, hits "send".</p><p>Now the fun begins. Alice's phone turns her input—"I'm here and want to send this meme to Bob who's there"—into <strong>packets</strong> of information.</p><p>These are composed of smaller bits of data, 1s and 0s—binary code. That's how computers speak at the lowest level. These packets also have <strong>headers</strong>, which contain key info on involved <strong>IP addresses </strong>(where the info's from and where it's going).</p><p>See, the Internet uses a specific protocol to send and receive information across its network. We call this the Internet Protocol—IP in short. Original, I know.</p></div><hr><p><strong>Fun fact</strong>:</p><ul><li>A single 1 or 0 = 1 bit</li><li>8 bits = 1 byte</li><li>1 000 000 bytes = 1 megabyte (MB)</li><li>1000 megabytes = 1 gigabyte (GB)</li></ul><div><p>So, if you explode your 4GB monthly data plan, <strong>it means you exchanged 34 359 738 368 1s/0s</strong>.</p><p>If you were to count these numbers at 1 per second, it would take you 397 682 years. Your badass network only takes minutes.</p></div><hr><p>Now, there's an antenna in your phone - you knew that, right? They used to be pretty visible:</p><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D62E29907FBE2CB91E90E5D06079CEBE537D2F35FA8BF216C789C2F625BF2361_1610815500116_90s+cellphone.png" alt=""></figure><div><p>That antenna takes these packets of info and turns them into—I kid you not—<em>frequencies</em>. These frequencies ride radio waves. We thus go from <strong>digital </strong>(1s &amp; 0s) to <strong>analog</strong> signal (frequencies).</p><p>Alice's router then picks up the signal containing the encoded information.</p><p><strong>Routers</strong> manage the "local" traffic flow—information circulating between different devices <em>inside</em> your home or office.</p><p>Once it has everything gathered, it passes the ball to its amigo, the modem.</p><p><strong>Modems</strong>, too, take the binary code (digital) that has been created by our devices and transform them into frequency-based signals (analog). We can then send these <em>outside </em>our homes, over the Internet.</p><p>Still with me? Good. Here, we jump from waves to cables. We used to have only good ol' trusty electrical wires. Today we have fiber optic cables. They're real fancy. They contain a mesh of glass that can carry information by way of LIGHT.</p><p>(I had a lightsaber joke, but it didn't make the cut.)</p><p>Inside fiber optic cables, the message is encoded onto waves in "words" (chunks of information). </p><p>Because these signals travel at the speed of the light inside the cables, they're transmitted very fast. And since we have tons of frequencies available to send that signal, it can carry LOTS of information. Each available frequency corresponds to different series of bytes.</p><p>The geek friend who explained that stuff to me said:</p></div><blockquote>The algorithms deployed to optimize this signal would make you fall on your ass.</blockquote><div><p>I fell on my ass more than enough for this lifetime, so allow me to cut this explanation here. 😅</p><p>Now that we have encoded the signal, the doggo meme is ready to travel within the wires mentioned above.</p><p>You know, the wires plugged into the back of your modem. They go <em>somewhere</em>. They go to other, bigger machines, which also have other, bigger cables connected to them.</p><p>The hierarchy here looks like this:</p></div><ul><li>local router → Internet Hubs → INTERNET BACKBONE</li></ul><p>In our case, the doggo meme's packets go through this adventure:</p><ul><li>Alice's home → A big building filled with servers couple miles from Alice's home → A bigger building filled with more servers near the ocean → That same building on the other side of the ocean → A big building filled with servers couple miles from Bob's place → Bob's place</li></ul><p>All of that happens almost instantaneously. It's like teleportation. It's amazing.</p><hr><div><p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: there are (surprisingly small) trans-oceanic cables connecting data centers all over the globe. They're sturdier today—but sharks could once, literally, bite through the Internet and make it crash.</p><p>Video proof? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/14/google-undersea-fibre-optic-cables-shark-attacks" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Sure</a>.</p></div><hr><div><p>Here's the part where I'd say, "That's it!"</p><p>But this ain't it. Internet is much more complicated than this. For instance, I haven't even touched <a href="https://howdns.works/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">domain names and DNS</a>. Or <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/clientserver" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">clients vs. servers</a>. However, this was a good primer. It provides a mental model for the Internet's basics, anchored in "real life".</p><p>Now, if all of this human ingenuity doesn't blow your mind, I don't know what will. <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Bitcoin, maybe</a>.</p><p>It's funny—it took the doggo meme milliseconds to get from Alice to Bob's phone. But it took me a couple of hours to explain how it got there.</p><p>Oh well. At least it'll only take milliseconds to share that post with thousands of people all over the world. 🙌</p><p>If you like this post, please share it on social somewhere.</p><p>I want to do more of these simple, story-driven explainers. I hope they help you understand the web as much as they help me.</p><p>🙇‍♂️</p></div><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">How Does The Internet Work - Standford</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQsmPf24go&amp;t=1s" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">How Does the Internet Work? - Glad You Asked</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MwMkBET_5I" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Fiber optic cables: How they work - engineerguy</a></li><li><a href="http://Internet Protocol" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Internet Protocol - Wikipedia</a></li><li>My colleagues Mathieu &amp; Guillaume 💛</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  <h3>Introducing Fyne v2.0.0</h3>
  <p>The v2.0.0 release of Fyne marks a big advance in the development of our project. This was a chance to step back, see what was working well and what could be improved - and then make the changes in a way that had not been possible whilst maintaining 1.0 API compatibility.
As a result there are some breaking changes that help to point the toolkit in a better direction for the future. Additionally this means that the import path has now changed to <code>fyne.io/fyne/v2</code> following the go module convention.</p>

<p>There are so many new features to talk about, let’s dive right in!</p>

<h2 id="data-binding">Data Binding</h2>

<p>Data binding is a powerful new API that helps applications with lots of data avoid the complex code required to keep widgets and data storage up to date.
By using a data binding the widget displaying your data will always have the same value as the sorce of that data. Additionally any widgets that can edit data will ensure that changes are immediately applied to the original data.</p>

<p>The data binding package defines many types (primitive data types as well as <code>List</code>, <code>Map</code> and <code>Struct</code>) that will cover most use-cases.
It also defines various conversion tools so that you can present formatted strings derived from other data types whilst keeping everything up to date automatically.
Additionally you can work directly with bound data by hooking a change listener in, sending data updates to the binding, or by implementing your own data sources and converters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>:=</span> <span>binding</span><span>.</span><span>NewFloat</span><span>()</span>
<span>slide</span> <span>:=</span> <span>widget</span><span>.</span><span>NewSliderWithData</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>formatted</span> <span>:=</span> <span>binding</span><span>.</span><span>FloatToStringWithFormat</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>"Float value: %0.2f"</span><span>)</span>
<span>label</span> <span>:=</span> <span>widget</span><span>.</span><span>NewLabelWithData</span><span>(</span><span>formatted</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To see more of what is possible with data binding you can check out the latest version of <code>fyne_demo</code>. The data binding tab shows how you can use <code>Float</code>, <code>Bool</code>, <code>List</code> and <code>Struct</code> types to bind various widgets.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ go get fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo
$ fyne_demo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>
<img src="https://fyne.io/blog/img/databinding.png">
</p>

<p>It is also possible to bind your data directly into user preferences so that your values are automatically stored across application restarts. For example to save the contents of an <code>Entry</code> widget to a <code>String</code> stored at <code>mykey</code> you could do the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>str := binding.BindPreferenceString("mykey", fyne.CurrentApp().Preferences())
entry := widget.NewEntryWithData(str)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This widget will display the current value of the preference field, and each time it is changed the new value will be saved.</p>

<h2 id="storage-repositories">Storage repositories</h2>

<p>The addition of storage repositories bring much more capability to our file abstraction layer.
Now a <code>URI</code> can reference any storage source, not just files (and data from other apps on mobile).
The content of a storage repository can be referenced anywhere that a <code>URI</code> is used,
such as the file dialog widget.
Interacting with this new API is just like using the <code>storage</code> package added in the v1.4 API.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ref</span> <span>:=</span> <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>NewFileURI</span><span>(</span><span>"/path/to/file.txt"</span><span>)</span>
<span>// or</span>
<span>ref</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>ParseURI</span><span>(</span><span>"content://appID/document?id=5"</span><span>)</span>

<span>read</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>Reader</span><span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>)</span> <span>// remember to call read.Close()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Developers can add new repositories alongside the built-in <code>file</code> handler.
A repository is identified by it’s scheme, which appears at the beginning of every URI.
To connect to a secure FTP server you would first define a new type (here named <code>myFTPRepository</code>) that implements <code>repository.Repository</code> (from the <code>fyne.io/fyne/v2/storage/repository</code> package) it can then be registered and used as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>repository</span><span>.</span><span>Register</span><span>(</span><span>"sftp"</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>myFTPRepository</span><span>{})</span>
<span>remoteURI</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>ParseURI</span><span>(</span><span>"sftp://server.name/path/to/mydata.txt"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If your <code>Repository</code> type also implements <code>ListableRepository</code> then you could browse its contents using the file dialog as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>ParseURI</span><span>(</span><span>"sftp://server.name/directory/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>dir</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>ListerForURI</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>)</span>
<span>browse</span> <span>:=</span> <span>dialog</span><span>.</span><span>NewFileOpen</span><span>(</span><span>callback</span><span>,</span> <span>win</span><span>)</span>
<span>browse</span><span>.</span><span>SetLocation</span><span>(</span><span>dir</span><span>)</span>
<span>browse</span><span>.</span><span>Show</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also replace existing repositories by registering a new one with the same scheme.</p>

<h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>

<p>The new animation APIs deliver an efficient way to provide smooth transition of a <code>CanvasObject</code> from one state to another over a specified time period.
All the intermediate values are calculated and timed to match the renderer frame rate.
These animations provide a way to provide hints or visual flair to user interface elements and can be seen on standard components such as tab container, button and entry.
You can see additional animations demonstrated in the <code>fyne_demo</code> application.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://fyne.io/blog/img/animation.png">
</p>

<p>You can add animations to your application with just a few lines of code. 
An animation can operate on any property of a graphical object by passing a callback and duration to <code>fyne.NewAnimation</code>.
For many standard cases the <code>canvas</code> package built-in animations will be beneficial, such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>anim</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>NewPositionAnimation</span><span>(</span>
	<span>fyne</span><span>.</span><span>NewPos</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>),</span> <span>fyne</span><span>.</span><span>NewPos</span><span>(</span><span>380</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>),</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>DurationStandard</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>fyne</span><span>.</span><span>Position</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>obj</span><span>.</span><span>Move</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>)</span>
		<span>obj</span><span>.</span><span>Refresh</span><span>()</span>
	<span>})</span>
<span>anim</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This animation will move <code>obj</code> to an appropriate position based on how long the animation has been running for.</p>

<h2 id="theme-updates">Theme updates</h2>

<p>The new Theme API allows for more flexible theming of standard widgets.
It introduces new colours, sizes and also allows themes to override the standard Icons.
Over time new features will be added to this API without the downside of breaking old themes.</p>

<p>Along with the new API come many advances to the look of our standard widgets including Entry, Select, ProgressBar and more. You can see below some of the changes in action
including a redesigned Form widget in a desktop app and the progress bars displayed on a mobile form-factor.</p>



<p>If you wish to use a custom theme that was defined before <code>v2.0</code> API updates you can use the convenience function <code>theme.FromLegacy</code> which converts an old theme API object so that it can be used in <code>App.Settings().SetTheme()</code>.</p>

<p>You can download and run the latest <code>fyne_demo</code> app to see all of the enhancements to the toolkit.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ go get fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo
$ fyne_demo
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr>

<h3 id="read-before-upgrading">Read Before Upgrading</h3>

<p>This release is our first that is not fully backward compatible.
Before upgrading an existing project please be sure to read the
<a href="https://developer.fyne.io/api/v2.0/upgrading">upgrading doc</a> for information about relevant changes.</p>

<p>I’ve tried lots of things for remote desktop, then settled for Chrome Remote Desktop. Official docs are not so reliable, and this gist did
the trick.</p>

<p>Honestly I don’t use this at all, but I think it is nice to have.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jellyfin is free &amp; open source, and it is not bloated with ads.
Start Jellyfin with Nvidia hardware acceleration enabled(You can check out <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html">docs</a> for more). Docker-compose is buggy with GPUs, so I have to use command
line for this. You have to install <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker">nvidia-docker2</a> before hand.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run <span>-d</span> <span>\</span>
 <span>--name</span><span>=</span>jellyfin <span>\</span>
 <span>-e</span> <span>NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES</span><span>=</span>all <span>\</span>
 <span>-e</span> <span>NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</span><span>=</span>all <span>\</span>
 <span>--gpus</span> all <span>\</span>

 <span>--restart</span> unless-stopped <span>\</span>
 jellyfin/jellyfin:unstable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since it is sharing(<code>--pid host</code>) PID namespace with host, you can run <code>nvidia-smi</code> on host machine directly to see if
Jellyfin is using GPU when transcoding content.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.lsgrep.com/images/jellyfin-nvidia.png" alt="jellyfin-nvidia"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Register an <a href="http://opensubtitles.org/">OpenSubtitles.org</a> account and install the plugin for the Jellyfin. You have
 to login with your account in the plugin settings page. With this you can add subtitles to your videos without too much effort.</li>
</ul>



<p><code>rclone</code> is kinda aggressive, so you have to use <code>--max-delete 0</code> to keep your files intact in your destination.</p>

January 25, 2021 | https://panelbear.com/blog/why-not-open-source/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/why-not-open-source/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Let me start by saying that there's many open source projects that have successfully demonstrated that open-source can support a business, and I have great respect for them. I’m thinking of projects like <a href="https://sidekiq.org/" rel="noopener">Sidekiq</a>, <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="noopener">Sentry</a>, and <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="noopener">Matomo</a>, but there's plenty more.</p><p>As a developer, I also prefer having access to the source code for the systems I rely on. That way, I can inspect it, and even patch it for my specific needs whenever the license allows.</p><p>I’ve learned a lot by reading code written by more experienced people than me, mostly from open source projects like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="noopener">Django</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finatra" rel="noopener">Finatra</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener">React</a> to name a few. Needless to say, I owe a lot to the open source community, and for that I will forever be grateful.</p><p>That said, I'm writing this from the angle of building a sustainable SaaS service <em>as a solo founder</em>. Your own context will influence whether my story is relatable to you.</p><h2>Been there, learned a lot</h2><p>I want to offer reliable software that I continue to maintain over the years, whether it’s open source or closed source, free or paid. However, I also need to be able to pay my bills. Ideally I'd build free, open-source software and still be able to afford a place to live (housing in Munich has gone insane). Unfortunately life's not that simple, and it doesn’t appear to work for most projects unless backed by established companies or those that happen to be at the right place at the right time. Donations could help, but odds are I won’t be able to support my livelihood with this model and continue to build and support the project.</p><p>So about three years ago I thought I had found the holy grail: I would develop the SaaS as an open source project that anyone could self-host, while offering a hosted version which I can manage for my customers. I assumed 90% of the users would just self-host it themselves, but it’d be a good enough compromise. So I went ahead, and did exactly <a href="https://traduora.com/" rel="noopener">that</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, I was very naive to think that running a business is the same as running an open source project. Just because lots of people and organizations use your software each month, doesn’t mean you can automatically support your livelihood.</p><p>But business model aside, the main issue comes along in the form of expectations regarding your commitment as an open source maintainer. For some reason, many people have come to expect open-source maintainers to deliver the same quality in the same amount of time that an entire team at a company could, and they want it for free. I learned that nothing makes people disappear faster from a GitHub thread than asking them if they want to contribute the code changes themselves.</p><p>This particular project I’m talking about has been downloaded more than half a million times (Docker pulls + GitHub clones) over the past two years. While this helped me raise awareness about the project, it did not lead to a successful business model on its own as I had (naively) assumed.</p><h2>What went wrong</h2><p>Back then, I choose to open source the project alongside a SaaS offering based on the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>It would lead to a healthier codebase, as more eyes were looking into it.</li><li>It would improve trust, as anyone can audit my code.</li><li>It would reduce the support burden, as people can look at past issues, and participate in the discussion threads.</li><li>It would help me drive growth, as marketing is not my strength.</li><li>The community would help me build new features for their specific use cases.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, almost all points above were false assumptions in my case. And sometimes it actually led to the opposite result. I won't dive into each point, but the main issue that this created for me was: increased operational burden as a solo-founder. If I was working together with a small team, the story may be different.</p><p>That said, there are many people who did contribute to the project, and for that I’m very grateful. It’s just unfortunate that they’re by far the minority.</p><p>Also I made the mistake of trying to be everything for everyone. I was too focused on developing every feature, trying to give support to every single ticket, and I completely ignored the marketing aspects of it as I had no time for it. It also made it really difficult to understand which issues to prioritize, and which ones might lead to more people supporting the business.</p><p>Not only that, but things like backwards compatibility for those self-hosting, handling support requests via email and chat groups, providing assistance to those installing it on incompatible platforms, were just taking away too much of my time. I was a solo founder, wearing all hats, prioritizing everything that came my way. Looking back, I ask myself: how could that work?</p><p>So while the project was used by several organizations, I quickly realized that it wasn't going to pay the bills given the time I was putting into it. Very soon I lost what helped me push along the whole way: my motivation. I knew while the project was of relative success on the open source front, it would require massive effort on my side to turn things around operationally and business-wise. However, without motivation, it’s easier said than done. The spark had simply faded away.</p><p>I did learn a lot out of this experience, and that's also why I have a lot of appreciation for those who have managed to get it right. I once read that making software is only 30% of what makes a tech company, and while I cannot confirm that number is accurate, the idea behind it rings true to me.</p><p>In short, like everyone else, I only have a limited amount of time in this world, and I have a life with family and friends to live too. Over the years I’ve had to re-evaluate how much time I'm willing to allocate to supporting each project.</p><p>So it needs to be sustainable if I want to do this for the long-term. I do continue to support every project I open source, but have reduced the release frequency to about twice per year. The main exception is security issues, which I do try to handle as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>I really don't want to be that guy that cannot be relied on, but I have other things going on in my life, just like everyone else, and have to watch out for my health too. Running a business, contributing to open-source, getting everything to run on the latest M1 chips is fun stuff, but so is living a full life with your loved ones.</p><h2>Pick your battles</h2><p>Last year I launched a new service, <a href="https://panelbear.com/" rel="noopener">Panelbear</a>, which is what the rest of this post is about. In short, it's a simple performance monitoring + website analytics SaaS that I started last September. It's fully self-funded, but this time I’m not open sourcing it from the start.</p><p>In the past, when it came to running a business <em>as a solo-founder</em>, having it open source created too much maintenance burden for very specific feature requests. In particular from non-paying users, who sometimes sent me emails directly, demanding I look at their issue, or help them fix things “as soon as possible”.</p><p>I am now trying another approach, and so far it’s more sustainable in my case. I have a better idea of which features to prioritize based on paying customers, which surprisingly tend to be more respectful of my time when they needed support.</p><p>Not being open source from the start, means I’ve been able to pivot and reinvent features more easily, as there’s not many “breaking changes” to coordinate (except for public APIs and libraries), or self-hosted deployments to support. I’m able to move faster because there’s only one deployment environment to support (or two if you count staging).</p><p>It’s also much more sustainable to build and grow a product at a pace in which it’s “just a thing I do” along with other things going on in my life, while being able to cover your expenses. There’s a saying: “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”, which feels very fitting in this case.</p><h2>I continue to open-source, when it makes sense</h2><p>Don't get me wrong, I do rely on, and continue to contribute to many open-source projects. I would have never gotten this far without the amazing community that continues to build, and support all these projects on their own time.</p><p>It's not entirely out of the question if I might one day reconsider, and open-source new projects. But for now I'll mainly open up libraries, and utilities, with a much smaller scope. That way I can afford to provide support for them, and hopefully more people are able to contribute since the codebase is smaller.</p><p>One day I might write a blog post reflecting on my second SaaS. That's the joy of the journey, there’s always something to learn.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>
<p>The source code is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A printed photo in an album can easily last 20+ years without deterioration.</p>
<p>Digital files are another story altogether: computers fail, hard drives crash,
and CDROMs deteriorate.</p>
<p>Reliably and robustly storing digital files used to require an IT staff and rack
of expensive hardware. Recent innovations have made this affordable and easy to
do, even for non-nerds.</p>
<p><em>TL;DR: Make sure you have <strong>multiple copies</strong>, on <strong>separate hardware</strong>, and
preferably <strong>at least one</strong> copy offsite. Newer filesystems available on NAS
devices can provide additional data integrity safeguards. And remember, <a href="https://photostructure.com/faq/raid-is-not-a-backup/">RAID
doesn’t count</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-old-axiom-3-2-1-backups">The old axiom: “3-2-1 backups”<a href="#the-old-axiom-3-2-1-backups" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>The “3-2-1” backup strategy from several decades ago was one of the more common
strategies for keeping files safe.</p>
<p>This strategy requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>at last <strong>three</strong> different copies of every file, with</li>
<li>at least <strong>two</strong> different <em>storage formats</em>, and</li>
<li>at least <strong>one</strong> copy offsite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, though, you can do better.</p>
<h2 id="why-different-storage-formats">Why different storage formats?<a href="#why-different-storage-formats" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>If you store your data on different formats, the hope is that the different
formats will have different lifespans. When one copy fails before the other, it
gives you time to make a new copy.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this line of reasoning, though.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/dvd.jpg" alt="Optical media"> <figcaption>
<p>Optical media</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first issue is that storage formats available to consumers are typically
only hard drives and optical storage media (CD-R, DVD-R, or BD-R). The latest
optical storage technology (as of July, 2020), is quad-layer blue ray which can
store 100GB per disk. External hard drives are regularly in the 6-12TB range,
which are <strong>60-120x larger</strong>. Backing up a $150 12TB hard drive on optical media
would be ridiculously herculean and expensive: it would take 120 BD-R disks, and
$1,400 in media, using $12 M-Discs.</p>
<h2 id="why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-data-integrity">Why 3-2-1 isn’t enough: data integrity<a href="#why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-data-integrity" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>All commonly available storage formats eventually suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">data
degradation</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption">corruption</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CD-R’s with organic dyes may only last a couple years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">Solid-state drives</a>, or SSD,
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/solid-state-disks-lose-data-if-left-without-power-for-just-a-few-days/">lose data integrity when unplugged in as little as a
year</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SD cards, when left unplugged, experience “cell voltage drift,” and lose integrity in 5-7 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">Hard disk drives</a>, commonly
called HDD or “spinning rust”, have <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html">substantial failure rates after 4-6 years
of continuous
service</a>. Even when
kept offline, HDD data integrity will degrade after 5-10 years due to
demagnetization of the iron oxide substrate, or servo and platter motor
failures. (Feel fortunate if your decade-old external drive still spins up!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data integrity is the big issue that “3-2-1 backups” doesn’t address: <strong>even if
you’ve got several copies of your data, how do you know that each copy hasn’t
suffered from data degradation?</strong></p>
<h2 id="an-example-of-data-degradation">An example of data degradation<a href="#an-example-of-data-degradation" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Your photos and videos are comprised of hundreds of thousands, millions or even
tens of millions of bits of data.</p>
<p>If a handful of those bits are “flipped” due to storage defects or media
degradation your file can become unreadable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an image with only a couple bits flipped:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/bitrot.jpg" alt="JPEG bit rot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (source)"> <figcaption>
<p>JPEG bit rot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">source</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the rightmost image contents are 99.999% correct, yet isn’t viewable.</p>
<h2 id="error-correction-codes">Error correction codes<a href="#error-correction-codes" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Hard drives and optical disks use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">error correction
codes</a> to provide some
amount of resiliency to bit rot. Typical ECC allows for several bits in a file
to flip, be detected, and be automatically repaired.</p>
<p>ECC can only detect and repair a specific rate of bit rot, however. Data
degradation in older storage media may exceed this rate.</p>
<h2 id="treating-the-symptom">Treating the symptom<a href="#treating-the-symptom" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>In developing PhotoStructure, we found that many of our photos on older hard
drives had succumbed to some amount of bit rot. We taught PhotoStructure how to
detect and skip over photos and videos that are corrupt, in the hope that you’ll
have several copies of a given photo, and one of them won’t have bit rot.</p>
<p>But this feature just treats the symptom: this doesn’t fix the underlying
problem.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-bit-rot">Overcoming bit rot<a href="#overcoming-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Several advanced filesystems, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">btrfs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>, support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data
scrubbing</a>, which detects and
repairs bit rot automatically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither Windows nor macOS support these filesystems (and their
newer filesystems, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a>,
still don’t detect bit rot). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time
Machine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_and_Restore">Backup and
Restore</a> don’t detect bit rot
either.</p>
<p>So: <em>how do normal people use these fancy new filesystems?</em></p>
<h2 id="nas-to-the-rescue">NAS to the rescue<a href="#nas-to-the-rescue" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network-attached
storage</a> (NAS) devices
hold several large hard drives and quietly do their work safely storing your
files. You can keep using your favorite OS, but you don’t have to worry about
bit rot anymore.</p>
<p>Most NAS also support Docker, which is a way of packaging and running
third-party applications, like PhotoStructure.</p>

<h2 id="that-sounds-great-which-nas-should-i-get">That sounds great. Which NAS should I get?<a href="#that-sounds-great-which-nas-should-i-get" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/series/home">Synology</a> is the easiest
and most “plug and play” of these solutions. Be sure to get a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Storage/Which_Synology_NAS_models_support_the_Btrfs_file_system">newer NAS that
supports
btrfs</a>.</p>
<p>Synology’s proprietary hardware comes at a bit of a cost premium than if you
built it yourself, and docker support via their UI is a bit limited (which can
be overcome by using a tool like <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://unraid.net/">Unraid OS</a> runs on hardware you already
have, supports XFS and btrfs, has great docker support, but requires a
commercial license to use. It’s very flexible in adding and removing drives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/">TrueNAS CORE</a> (previously “FreeNAS”) is
free and fairly easy to install. It uses ZFS, and supports a wide variety of
hardware. If building a computer is intimidating and you’d like to try
TrueNAS CORE, the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-mini/">TrueNAS Mini</a> comes
pre-assembled.</p>
<p>Note that expanding existing volumes by adding additional disks (which is
simple on Synology and Unraid) is <em>not fun</em> on FreeNAS, due to limitations in
ZFS. FreeNAS natively uses FreeBSD jails, which are technically excellent but
decidedly less popular than Docker. More recent versions of FreeNAS have added
docker support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.snapraid.it/">SnapRAID</a> is different from these other
alternatives, in that it’s not an operating system nor a filesystem: it’s an
open-source application that runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>SnapRAID is the only non-realtime data integrity product here: it must be run
periodically to build snapshots or check and repair data integrity errors.
SnapRAID requires command-line expertise and manual setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(PhotoStructure has no commercial affiliation with any of these products. We’d
caution against cheaper NAS brands, however, as lax security updates may lead to
malware infections and data loss.)</em></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-your-nas">Getting started with your NAS<a href="#getting-started-with-your-nas" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider getting a NAS that supports 4 or more drives. More slots for more
drives gives you a lot more flexibility in the future, should your data
exceed your original drives. If you’re building a box to run Unraid,
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/">Fractal</a> makes some nice cases: the new
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-7/black/">Define
7</a> and
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/meshify/meshify-2/black/">Meshify
2</a>
support 12+ HDDs (!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy 50% more storage than you need right now so you have room to grow in the
near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable weekly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data scrubbing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_%28computer_storage%29#File_systems">snapshotting</a>,
if available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable monthly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.#Self-tests">S.M.A.R.T. self-tests</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up your NAS to either apply security patches automatically or notify you
to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider installing a virus scanner and malware detection package on your
NAS. Synology has a “security audit” tool as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your router has recently-updated firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use secure admin and user passwords. Enable 2FA if available. Using a
password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> makes this easy to
do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your NAS to tell you if it has any errors: <strong>you don’t want any
disks dying or backups failing without you knowing it.</strong></p>
</li>

<p>Please understand: <a href="https://photostructure.com/faq/raid-is-not-a-backup"><strong>RAID is not a backup</strong></a>. Please
read that post before continuing.</p>
<p>Satisfy the 2nd or 3rd copy of the “at least 3 copies” rule by copying the
entire contents of your NAS to an external hard drive that normally stays
powered down and offline. Do this quarterly.</p>
<p>Consider storing this drive near your emergency kit so you can grab it as you
leave your house in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>This external drive can also reduce your dataloss if your NAS catastrophically
fails, or if you get hit by malware like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker">cryptolockers</a>.</p>

<p>Satisfy the “at least 1 offsite” rule by setting up your NAS to back up to a
cloud service automatically. <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> and
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a> are both well-regarded offsite storage
solutions, and both have solutions that work with your new NAS.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to pay for cloud storage, you can set up another NAS (like at
a friend or family member’s house). Both FreeNAS and Synology support NAS-to-NAS
replication.</p>
<p>Make sure you configure the replication job to run in the middle of the night,
and throttle network bandwidth so you don’t make your friends or family grumpy.</p>

<a href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a> (for Android), and
<a href="https://www.photosync-app.com/home.html">PhotoSync</a> (for iOS and Android) will
automatically back up your phone to your NAS at home.</p>
<p>You install the software on both your phone and your NAS, and then configure
your phone to automatically back up to your NAS.</p>
<p>We recommend this approach, rather than uploading to a cloud service, simply to
ensure your original files stay intact.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Generating APIs is becoming more and more popular. Especially the GraphQL community is "suffering" from this trend.
Production-ready APIs with authentication and caching in minutes, define the schema, and you're almost done.
As we all know, everything comes at a cost.
This post takes a critical look at generated GraphQL APIs, the benefits as well as the tradeoffs you're going to make.</p><h2>History and Trends<a href="#history-and-trends" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generated GraphQL APIs look like a hot trend nowadays. Some venture backed companies push this topic hard to make it mainstream.
We hear praises of the amazing developer experience and how productive people are.
However, is this really a sustainable business?</p><p>If we look back a few years you might remember the term "Backend as a Service" (BaaS), established by companies like Parse.
The impact of parse, nowadays seems to be diminished. A lot of others jumped on the BaaS train, but except Firebase, you don't hear much on the topic nowadays.</p><p>Then came GraphQL and companies tried the same thing again.
If we look at the graveyard of failed companies you might find some familiar names like Reindex, Graphcool, etc...</p><p>Today, we have tools like Appsync and Hasura leading the pack, followed by many smaller companies who imitate them and try to diversify in various ways.</p><p>Appsync might be an outlier because their goal is not only BaaS but making AWS products easy to integrate, which is a different value proposition than their competition.</p><p>Another emerging trend is (Serverless) Databases as a Service.
dgraph offers a native GraphQL Database.
FaunaDB offers a Serverless Database which also comes with a GraphQL interface.
Then there's edgeDB which also offers a GraphQL interface.
I guess if you search for a while you'll find more.</p><p>Another quite popular category is Content Management Systems with GraphQL APIs.
The distinction from just BaaS is that these tools allow non-technical people to create content while developers can consume the content via GraphQL APIs.</p><p>How comes that the idea of BaaS/generated APIs keeps coming up while most of the implementations fail?</p><p>We might be able to look back in time to better understand why this approach is failing.
If you ask Prisma, the makers of Graphcool, they refer to this tweet:</p><blockquote><p>Exposing the database schema 1:1 via a generated graphql api totally misses the point of graphql - or an api as an intended abstraction.</p><p>-- <cite>Manuel Schoebel</cite></p></blockquote><p>We'll come back to this citation later.</p><h2>Developer experience of generated APIs<a href="#developer-experience-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>One feature of generated APIs you cannot deny is the developer experience.
If you're an experienced Full-Stack developer you're able to start new projects in minutes.
Spin up a database, define the schema, API done. You're now able to start building the frontend.</p><p>Some of the services allow you to build the schema using a user interface only.
This allows even less experienced Frontend developers to build their own "APIs".
You click a few buttons and your API with authentication is ready to use.</p><p>But what about maintenance?
How do you evolve applications built using this approach?
What if you don't just have one API consumer?</p><p>Let's have a look at possible use cases.</p><h2>Use cases of generated APIs<a href="#use-cases-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generating APIs can be an amazing time-saver if you're a single developer, working on a small project.
You don't have to expose the API to other developers. It's just you using them.
You understand the tradeoffs, e.g. leaking some business logic into the client.
You're still happy because you saved a lot of time not having to build a backend.</p><p>Another good example where generated APIs can be very helpful is prototyping.
You want to bring an idea to life. You don't care about the quality of your API.
All you need is some CRUD methods to demonstrate an application to a prospect.</p><p>What about larger teams and projects? Are generated APIs also a good fit for enterprise use cases?</p><p>In order to answer this question, let's first have a look at what an API is.</p><h2>What is an API?<a href="#what-is-an-api" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I'll not go into much detail of this topic, as I want to stay focused.
If you're interested to learn more about what an API is, I can highly recommend Erik Wilde <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDYeU2T4v2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talking about the topic</a>.</p><p>Too long, didn't watch:</p><p>An API is an interface, abstracting away an implementation of a contract.
In Eriks example, he explains how a weather forecast company exposes their forecasts through an API to other developers.</p><p>GraphQL is a Query language, offering one way of implementing APIs.</p><p>APIs make integrations scalable because we can rely on standards and don't have to understand every detail of a system.
E.g. if an API speaks GraphQL, clients know already how to interact with the system.
We can understand the API by issuing an introspection Query and from there on use the Queries and Mutations defined in the GraphQL schema.</p><p>Without tools like GraphQL, we had to invent custom contracts and integration tooling for every API.</p><p>One important aspect of the success of an API is its design.
APIs must be able to cover common use cases of API consumers.
E.g. a weather API is useless if it's almost impossible to get forecasts for the next few days in a very easy way.</p><p>Next, we'll look into API design to further understand why generated APIs don't scale.</p><h2>On good API design<a href="#on-good-api-design" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Going back to the weather forecast service, we talked about success factors of the API.
An API can also be seen as a product as it serves a specific purpose.</p><p>How can a weather forecast API be successful?
As with any other product, you have to talk to your users and adapt to their needs.
You have to re-shape your product to serve your customers well.</p><p>In case of an API, re-shaping means finding a good API design.</p><p>And with that, we're at the core of the problem of generated APIs.</p><p>It's impossible to design an API when all you do is deriving it from e.g. database tables.
A good API is not just making raw data accessible. A good API is driven by use cases, making it easy to integrate.
It doesn't have to be a public facing API. If you're providing an API to other developers it should be designed around their use-cases.
Deriving APIs from database schemas, tables or whatever it is means, you're not designing, you're not focussing on your users.</p><p>The consequences are well described by Erik:</p><blockquote><p>If you're designing an API by avoiding designing it, you end up with the design you deserve.</p><p>-- <cite>Erik Wilde</cite></p></blockquote><p>If you skip the design phase, you'll end up with unhappy users.
If your company depends on the success of your APIs, this could be a deal breaker.</p><p>Imagine you're an engineer and your task is to build a new steering wheel for a car.
You'll take the whole description of the CAN-BUS (internal communication system) description of the car and "generate" a panel of knobs from it.
This steering wheel might have thousands of buttons and is barely usable.</p><p>Wouldn't it make more sense to figure out how people would want to steer a car?
What knobs they need on it to control the radio without losing control of the car?
Once you have figured out the requirements you could then start mocking a few designs.
With those designs you'd then go to users and test if they work they way you expect.
You'll then iterate your ideas until you find a good design.
Only then, you'll actually build a real steering wheel.
One that you're confident will solve the problem of your user.</p><p>What's different from a steering wheel and the API of your service?
Why is it not obvious that generated APIs don't solve the problem.</p><p>You'd be much faster generating a steering wheel because you don't have to spend time designing and implementing it.
If you're the only user of your steering wheel, this might work because you know all about CAN-BUS systems.
However, this approach won't scale if you want to build APIs for other teams and companies.</p><h2>Information hiding principle<a href="#information-hiding-principle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Another important aspect of APIs is abstraction and information hiding.</p><p>API consumers should not have to think about the implementation.
But what if the API is leaking implementation details?</p><p>Let's have a look at this simple example:</p><p>Even if the language is GraphQL, it's clear that we're talking to a relational database and SQL is used behind the scenes.</p><p>Should an API consumer have to think about primary keys? Isn't that a concern of storing data, a completely different layer?</p><p>How about JSON selectors as arguments?</p><p>Isn't the implementation leaking information on how data is being stored?</p><p>Here's another example where GraphQL is being abused as an ORM.</p><p>The consequence of these examples is that it's almost impossible to make changes to the implementation.</p><p>Developers who know some basics on databases might see another problem with this approach.
In case of complex WHERE clauses (hello SQL) or aggregations, you have to make sure that the required indices exist on the database.
Otherwise, you'll run into full table scan problems.</p><p>I think it's clear that all these examples violate the principle of information hiding.</p><h2>Implementing APIs<a href="#implementing-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In the very beginning, we were looking at the developer experience of generated APIs and how much time you can save by not implementing the API but generating it.
We then learned that generated APIs generally don't scale well beyond personal projects because they are not driven by use cases.</p><p>Now, let's have a look at what actually makes a good API implementation.</p><p>A good API implementation decouples the API contract from data storage and other aspects like e.g. authentication.
A good API implementation allows you to change how you store data without breaking the API contract.
A good API also allows you to easily evolve and extend the contract for new use cases.
These three requirements are impossible to accomplish with generated APIs that are tightly coupled to infrastructure.</p><p>But there's one additional component that tops all of them: Business logic or state machines.
A good API doesn't force API consumers to implement their own state machine to interpret the data of the API.
Forcing API consumers to interpret raw data and derive state is prone to errors and should be avoided.</p><p>Let's have a closer look at state machines.</p><h2>State …</h2></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

	<p>Open source licenses are in the news again. Elastic recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the licensing for ElasticSearch and Kibana</a> from Apache 2.0 to a choice of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL) or the non-open source Elastic license. Like most open source licensing changes, this one prompted a lot of discussion. Examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25776657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> include some of the more printable comments.&nbsp;</p><p>But we’re not here to discuss Elastic’s business model or their choice of license(s).&nbsp; We’re here to discuss ClickHouse licensing and Altinity’s view of it. Here’s the executive summary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ClickHouse is Apache 2.0.&nbsp; Altinity is committed to ensuring it stays that way.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our contributions to ClickHouse are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apache 2.0</a>. Our ecosystem projects like the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator are likewise Apache 2.0. We believe the Apache 2.0 license is best for our users. It’s also the best way to make ClickHouse the most popular SQL data warehouse on the planet. There are several reasons for our outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important feature of Apache 2.0 is that it allows use for any purpose, which is the first of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four essential freedoms</a> of open source software. Such freedom is important for all applications, regardless of whether they run on-prem or as cloud services. Apache 2.0 opens the door to imaginative new services as well as creative paths to develop them. Installed&nbsp;applications morph into online services. Services that hide data behind APIs morph into open data. This freedom is key to enabling innovative new ways to incorporate analytics into applications, which in turn unlocks new business opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 is also a great license for contributors.&nbsp; It has been around since 2004, which is a long time in open source. Corporate legal departments understand it and can easily approve contributions from employees. Individual contributors understand the freedom Apache 2.0 confers to publish their work and use it freely in future. It’s a win-win: companies are motivated to make investment decisions in open source projects, and contributors are motivated to implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 licensing opens a path to increasing ClickHouse capabilities and worldwide use. More important, it is enabling a flood of innovation in analytic applications. In a crowded market with many database products besides ClickHouse, that’s a critical competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-apache-2-0-creates-a-level-playing-field">Apache 2.0 creates a level playing field</h2>
</p><p>Since the ClickHouse Apache 2.0 license places no restriction on business use, we can expect many competing services that leverage ClickHouse in one way or another.&nbsp; This includes hosted ClickHouse and value-added analytic services built on top of ClickHouse capabilities. It also extends to add-ons for countless existing services ranging from web analytics to network flow log management to financial asset valuation and everything in between.</p><p>The competition will be distressing for unprepared vendors, but it’s great for users. Competing services mean that users have alternatives. It also means that innovation is not random but focused on things that users care about: SQL features, performance, security, cost-efficiency, and time to market.&nbsp;</p><p>The same vendors that offer ClickHouse managed services have contributed popular features to ClickHouse like <a href="https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-and-s3-compatible-object-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S3 storage integration</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/access-rights/#role-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Role-based Access Control</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Table Expressions</a>, and many more. ClickHouse is experiencing the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-opetition</a> feedback effect that helped fuel the success of Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and other open source projects.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-restrictive-licenses-like-sspl-are-antithetical-to-user-interests">Restrictive licenses like SSPL are antithetical to user interests</h2>
</p><p>The Server Side Public License is an attempt to set back the clock on open source software development. It rules out new SaaS offerings based on projects whose value&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p>…entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.&nbsp; (SSPL Section 13).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>The goal of the SSPL and similar licenses is nothing short of setting up monopoly providers of SaaS offerings. It has ambiguous terms–creating uncertainty for potential competitors–and onerous viral requirements. Services that fall under Section 13 must release all source code required to run the entire SaaS offering. That includes everything from the service management plane down to deployment and backup scripts. SSPL is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyleft</a> with fangs.&nbsp;</p><p>This obviously affects vendors trying to set up competing services to the copyright holders of SSPL projects. But the effect on the market is far wider.&nbsp; Analytics are pervasive in modern applications and SaaS is the primary way that software is now distributed. The SSPL potentially harms any user building an application who just wants a managed offering to take care of running it. We believe that’s an unacceptable limitation.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-but-wait-what-about-amazon">But wait, what about Amazon?</h2>
</p><p>Many vendors have justified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source relicensing as a necessary defense</a> against “strip mining” from public clouds. Aren’t we afraid of this ourselves? If so, it’s a bit late. There are already multiple cloud services for ClickHouse, including our own offering, <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altinity.Cloud</a>. There’s also <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/services/managed-clickhouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yandex.Cloud</a> and at least three services in China. New entrants need to compete by adding additional value, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/08/suse-acquires-rancher-labs-reported-600m-chases-1b-revenue-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just as Rancher did</a> in the Apache 2.0-licensed Kubernetes market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal at Altinity is to help customers bring high-value analytic applications to market quickly and operate them cost-effectively. We focus on development efficiency, data privacy, world-class support, and operations. We do so on all platforms, both public cloud and on-prem. Anybody who has worked on such services knows there’s opportunity here to build many valuable companies, not just one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other paths are possible. Vendors may fork ClickHouse and try to add licenses that create a proprietary fortress. If so, we would point to some friendly advice from a famous competitive analyst of the Italian Renaissance:&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p><em>So the best fortress that exists is to avoid being hated by the people. If you have fortresses and the people hate you, they will not save you</em>.</p>
<p><cite><em>Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince</em></cite></p></blockquote>
</div><p>We don’t want to build new fortresses to protect ourselves against our users. We want to tear them down. Apache 2.0 is the key to enabling a new generation of analytic applications based on ClickHouse. Altinity is all in.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S., If you are worried about ElasticSearch and Kibana switching licenses, this might be a nice time to look at alternatives. ClickHouse can store log data remarkably well. More on that in future articles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>A close look at the psychology of wine, how marketing affects your perceptions, and why you’re paying too much for wine.</em></p>



<p>In 2002, four Wall Street businessmen sat down for dinner at the Balthazar in New York City. They ordered a Mouton Rothschild 1989 for the table.</p>



<p>The Balthazar menu lists this wine at $2,000. It’s not hard to see why. The Mouton Rothschild 1989 is an exceptional wine, produced from grapes grown on 205 acres near Pauillac, just northwest of Bordeaux. At the time the grapes were grown, the vineyard was owned by Philippine de Rothschild, a member of the infamous Rothschild family at the center of banking in Europe from the eighteenth century onward. According to the <a href="https://www.liz-palmer.com/wine-review-chateau-mouton-rothschild-1989/">tasting notes</a> of Liz Palmer, the noted wine critic, the Mouton Rothschild 1989 is “a lovely Pauillac that has reached its plateau of maturity; notably dark ruby in colour; It has an engaging cedar and tobacco bouquet with hints of mint; not much fruit concentration; the palate follows suit – is medium-bodied and continues the aromatic theme of cedar and tobacco; demonstrates great persistence; well-defined – ‘old school’.” At a tasting in 2018, Jane Anson, the Bordeaux correspondent for <em>Decanter </em>magazine, gave it 97 points out of a possible 100.</p>



<p>That was the wine they ordered.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t the wine they got.</p>



<p>Instead, their server brought them an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>There had been a mix-up. The staff had poured the two wines into two decanters and sent the wrong decanter to the table.</p>



<p>Five minutes later, the restaurant manager rushed to their table to explain what had happened.</p>



<p>How did they these businessmen react? With incredulity, that a restaurant could make such a costly mistake? That their dinner had been ruined?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>Though they suspected what they were drinking wasn’t the wine they had ordered, they didn’t realize they were drinking an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a few tables away, the beneficiaries of the mistake—a couple who ordered the $18 Pinot Noir—didn’t realize it, either. In fact, as they unknowingly drank the $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 they “jokingly pretended to be drinking an expensive wine.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65224613" title="Mercer, C. (2020) NY restaurant couple mistakenly served $2000 Mouton 1989 after ordering $18 Pinot. <em>Decanter</em>. October 22, 2020."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>How could this have happened?</p>



<p>Not the mistake in the kitchen: the swapped decanters, the wrong wine at the wrong tables.</p>



<p>The real mistake was a mistake in perception: that an $18 Pinot Noir and a $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 could be confused in the first place.</p>



<p>In today’s post, we’re going to take a deep dive into the world of expensive wine. We’ll see if expensive wine really tastes better or if the mix-up at the Balthazar was a one-off mistake. We’ll explore the ways price signals quality. We’ll look at how expectations influence perceptions. And we’ll finish with a definitive guide to buying great wine.</p>



<p>Sometimes you can answer a question with a statement supported by data, science, and story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to the question—<em>does expensive wine really taste better?</em>—is not such an answer. Instead, this answer is a series of layers, each one more complicated than the last, and each one introducing a new set of questions—and a new set of revelations about taste, status, and perception.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine</h2>



<p>When people don’t know the price, they like cheap wine just as much as expensive wine.&nbsp;Between April 2007 and February 2008, Robin Goldstein and his colleagues conducted 6,175 blind tests with 506 participants tasting 523 wines that ranged in price from $1.65 to $150.00 per bottle. About 12% of the participants had taken a sommelier course or had some kind of training. The test was double-blind: neither the person drinking the wine nor the person serving the wine knew the price. After each taste, participants rated it either “Bad,” Okay,” “Good,” or “Great.” Goldstein found that, on the whole, people actually gave <em>higher </em>ratings for cheap wine than expensive wine. However, compared to non-experts, the experts rated expensive wine more favorably. It seems that everyone likes cheap wine more than expensive wine, though experts are better at rating expensive wines compared to non-experts.<span id="easy-footnote-2-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65224613" title="Goldstein, R., Almenberg, J., Dreber, A., Emerson, J. W., Herschkowitsch, A., &amp;amp; Katz, J. (2008). Do more expensive wines taste better? Evidence from a large sample of blind tastings. <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>, 3(1), 1-9."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Other blind tastings have produced the same results. In 2011, Johan Almenberg and Anna Dreber of the Stockholm School of Economics had 135 people rate a $40 wine and 131 people rate a $5 wine, both on a scale of 1 to 100. They split the tasters into three groups:</p>



<ol><li>Some people learned the price <em>before </em>they tasted it.&nbsp;</li><li>Others learned the price <em>after </em>they tasted it, but before they rated it.&nbsp;</li><li>And a third group did a blind tasting: they never learned the price and only tasted and rated the wine.</li></ol>

<p>For many people, a $40 wine sounds expensive. But for others, such as sommeliers, wine critics, and others, a $40 wine is still well below the threshold of what a great wine should cost. What if we compare a $40 wine (expensive to some, but cheap to others) to a $400 or $4,000 wine? In 2013, Vanessa Harrar and her colleagues conducted a blind tasting of seven sparkling wines, including six Champagnes. There were fifteen tasters, including four who considered themselves experts and five who considered themselves novices. This tasting, too, revealed no correlation between price and rating. Cheap Champagnes taste better than expensive Champagnes. In fact, of the wines sampled, the lowest rating was a Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque Blanc de Blanc 2002, priced at £400; while the highest rated wines were a Mumm Vintage 2004 (£40) and a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque 2004 (£100). It seems that not only do cheap wines taste the same as expensive wines, but expensive wines taste the same as <em>very</em> expensive wines, too. <span id="easy-footnote-4-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-65224613" title="Harrar, V., Smith, B., Deroy, O. et al. Grape expectations: how the proportion of white grape in Champagne affects the ratings of experts and social drinkers in a blind tasting. <em>Flavour </em>2, 25 (2013)."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Follow-up studies confirmed this. The next year, Robert H. Ashton published the results of his tasting session in the <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>. In his study, 48 people, all members of a wine appreciation club at Duke University, tasted six wines each. They rated each wine on a scale of 1 to 10. As before, people thought the cheaper wines tasted better. In fact, in one of the tastings, the most expensive wine (a $119 bottle) was ranked a 3.70 and the cheapest wine (a $22 bottle) was ranked a 4.00.<span id="easy-footnote-5-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-65224613" title="Ashton, R.

<p>These and numerous other studies point in the same direction: in blind taste tests, people can’t distinguish cheap wine from expensive wine.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between two wines</h2>



<p>There’s a deeper issue, though. The real reason people can’t distinguish expensive wine from cheap wine is because they can’t distinguish <em>any </em>wine from <em>any other</em> wine—at least at rates that are no better than chance. In a series of two tastings, Roman Weil, the former co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US, poured two wines into four glasses: one wine split between two glasses and the other wine split between the other two glasses. Then, he took one of the four glasses away, and served the remaining three glasses in the tasting. Thus, two of the three glasses were poured from the same bottle, and one of the three glasses from its own bottle. (If this is getting confusing, scroll down to the image.) Weil asked people to identify which two were the same and which one was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did people do?</p>



<p>Not great.</p>



<p>In the first tasting, people identified the wines from the same vintage only 41.5% of the time. That’s not very good when you consider that people would correctly pick the two wines from the same bottle 33.3% of the time if they made decisions at random: there are three glasses, so picking the two of three glasses at random would be correct 1 in 3 times. <span id="easy-footnote-6-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-65224613" title="Weil, R.L. (2001). Parker v. Prial: The death of the vintage chart. <em>Chance</em>, 14, 27–3"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Weil’s second tasting produced similar results. This time, Weil had 395 people compare 855 pairs of regular wines and reserve wines, which are usually produced from superior grapes. People correctly identified only 346 of the 855 pairs, or roughly 40.5% of pairs, compared to the 33.3% that would be expected from random chance. Then, in a final step, Weil asked the 346 people who got it right to tell him which wine was the regular wine, and which wine was the reserve—the purportedly better wine. Of the 346 people, 170 people (49.1%) preferred the regular wine and 176 (50.9%) preferred the reserve—rates that are virtually the same as picking one of the wines at random (50.0%).<span id="easy-footnote-7-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-65224613" title="Weil, R.L.

<p>Weil’s studies show that people can tell two wines apart at rates that are barely better than chance (1 in 3) , and when they can, they pick the better wine at rates equal to chance (1 in 2).</p>



<p>Wine is an acquired taste. It takes time, training, and practice to tell good wine from bad (which could, itself, be evidence that great wine isn’t objectively great, though I digress). Perhaps expert tasters would perform better?</p>



<p>Unfortunately not. Professionals don’t do any better than novices: even people who are trained to taste, describe, and recommend wine for a living—and whose recommendations carry enormous weight within the industry and beyond—can’t tell one wine from another in a blind test. One of the first studies to reveal these inconsistencies took place at the wine competition of the California State Fair between 2005 and 2008. The competition is the oldest in the United States, and its judges include, “winemakers, wine buyers, wine critics and professors of enology and viticulture,” according to Robert T. Hodgson, the retired statistics professor and 35-year owner of the Fieldbrook Winery in California who conducted the study. Wineries are happy to pay more than $1 million collectively in entry fees to have their wine judged at the fair, since a gold medal awarded by judges at the fair can propel an unknown wine to the top of the market.<span id="easy-footnote-8-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-65224613" title="Hodgson, R.T.

<p>Typically, judges at the state fair taste between four and six flights of wine per day, and each flight contains 30 wines. However, Hodgson served them a second flight that contained …</p></div></article></div>

  <tbody><tr>
    <td>
<img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/qtanim2.gif" width="174" height="145" alt="(Animation) Ban the Drawer">
As part of their effort to mimic the appearance of the hand-held consumer device, the designers of the <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i> employed "drawer-like" interface elements.  The most notable of these, and unquestionably the single biggest blunder in the design of the application (other than attempting to mimic a physical device) is the <strong>Favorites Drawer</strong>.  The Favorites Drawer is intended to provide the user rapid access to his or her favorite multimedia files.  By that concept alone, it <i>should</i> be a useful interface feature.  Unfortunately, by virtue of attempting to mimic real-world devices, and due to a complete lack of familiarity with basic design principles, the Favorites Drawer in <i>QuickTime</i> is a dismal failure.
<p>The designers provided a smooth animation to give the appearance of the drawer opening at the bottom of the device, much like, one supposes, a panel might open on a hand-held device, and very much like the phone number "drawer" used in IBM's <a href="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/phone.html"><i>RealPhone</i></a>.  The drawer demonstrates one distinct problem of translating real-world phenomena to the computer desktop: <strong>real-world phenomena are not subject to the constraints of screen size</strong>.  The extent to which the drawer can "open", and therefore the number of items visible in the drawer, is a function of where the player is located in relation to the bottom of the screen.  If you want to hold more than a few items in the drawer, you'll have to first position the player near the top of the screen.  If you want to hold a lot of items in the drawer, you'll have to increase the resolution of your monitor.  If the player is positioned too close to the bottom of the screen, the drawer will simply not open.
Similarly, the current size of the player can interfere with the user's ability to access items in the Favorites Drawer; if the size of the player is increased, there is less screen real estate into which the drawer can open and therefore, fewer items in the drawer are accessible.  These problems would not exist if the designers had employed a standard pop-up window to contain the user's favorites.  These problems are the direct, expected results of dogmatic adherence to a faulty design philosophy.  By restricting themselves to the real-world metaphor, and not availing themselves of the dynamic features that computers provide, the designers needlessly restricted the utility and usability of the software.
</p><center><img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/favs.gif" width="347" height="193" alt="Could not have been made any worse"></center>
<p>A look at the arrangement of items in the drawers demonstrates another fundamental problem with the translation of physical devices to software.  The favorites are arranged in a matrix, the number of elements of which is limited by the size of the screen.  A physical item is limited by its physical size.  A virtual item, such as a list of phone-numbers or favorites, is limited only by the amount of computer memory.  If the designers had provided a standard list box there would be virtually no limit to the number of favorites that a user could maintain.  Furthermore, by availing themselves of other standard GUI elements, the designers could have provided a great deal of additional functionality such as organizing favorites by whatever constructs the user wishes to employ, or creating a PlayList of items to be played successively.  Computer software is the ideal platform on which to offer such functionality, but because of their adherence to the physical device, the designers of the <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i>, like other RealThings apologists, have made their software woefully inept in an area in which it should greatly excel.
</p><p>The images in the Favorites Drawer, despite their appearance, are not entirely meaningless.  The <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i> assigns an image to those items that represent <strong>sound</strong> files.  All sound files however, will be assigned the <strong>same image</strong>, and the program provides no means by which the user can substitute a meaningful image.  On the other hand, the image used to represent a given movie is a thumbnail image of the first frame of the movie.  On the surface, this may seem appropriate, until one looks at a collection of movies: most of the movies we downloaded, especially those from Apple, begin with a <strong>blank, black screen</strong>.  The first frame of the remainining movies constituted a copyright notice which is especially unrecognizeable when reduced to thumbnail size. <strong>What were they thinking?</strong>
</p><p>The images in the drawer indicate little more than the fact that the drawer contains items.  For some completely inexplicable reason, the designers did not feel that it was important to display a title or other description of the item itself, nor did the designers provide any secondary means in the drawer itself, such as tooltips, balloon help, or a message in a status bar to distinguish various titles.  This is not a result of the inappropriate application of a real-world metaphor; this is simply pitiful design.  Balloon Help would certainly help the user,  but it would still require the user to pass the cursor over each image until the desired target could be located.  Since Balloon Help requires intervention of the user to be effective, it should be regarded as little more than a quick fix and not a substitute for an appropriate design of the Favorites function.
</p><p>The lack of meaningful descriptions for the items forces the user to rely on the physical position of the item in the matrix.  Unfortunately, if the user resizes the player window, the number of images in each row of the drawer may or may not change. The end result is that the user can no longer rely on image position as an aid to identification.  An item that was the third row from the bottom, might, after resizing, appear in the second row.  Because of the lack of labels and reliable positioning information, selecting a particular movie or sound file from the favorites drawer is not unlike trying to find a caramel-filled chocolate from a sampler box of chocolates.   As expressed by Forest Gump in the movie bearing his name:
</p><center><p><strong><em>
Mama always said life is like a box of chocolates,<br>
you never know what you are going to get.</em></strong>
</p></center>
<p>The only reliable means of finding a particular type of chocolate is to either bite into each, or at least press your thumb into the bottom of each and hope that nobody notices later.  Similarly, the only reliable means with which the user can identify a file of choice in the favorites drawer is to open several until he or she <em>happens upon</em> the file of interest.  If the designers had been concerned with the users' objectives at this point of the interaction with the <em>QuickTime 4.0 Player</em>, specifically, the ability to rapidly locate and open a particular file of interest, the favorites drawer would never have seen the light of day.  Unfortunately, the designers were far more interested in form over function, where "looking good" is considered more important than working well.
</p><p><img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/orgfav.gif" width="257" height="198" alt="An old standby to the rescue">The application does provide additional means to determine the names of one's favorite media files, but the user must <strong>go somewhere else</strong>.  The application's menu bar offers a function labelled "Organize Favorites", which when selected provides a <strong>standard listbox</strong> containing the names of the favorites.  The listbox allows the user to rename favorites, delete favorites from the list, and reorder items in the list; these functions are notably unavailable from the Favorites Drawer itself.  The Organize Favorites dialog is not without its own design problems.  Surprisingly, the Organize Favorites dialog does not allow the user to Add favorites to the list, for that, the user has to ...<strong>go somewhere else</strong>.  Items in the list can be reordered, but no indication is provided that this is possible.  Further, as an example of a failure to pay attention in <strong>GUI 101</strong>, the designers do not allow the user to make multiple selections in the listbox; you cannot delete more than one item at a time, nor move more than one item at a time.  (Additional design inadequacies of the dialog are discussed below).
</p><p>Those limitations aside, all the designers need to do is add the ability to launch a favorite from the Organize Favorites dialog, change the title of the dialog to "Favorites", and burn the source code for the drawer. In so doing, they will exponentially improve the utility and usability of the Favorites function.  Then, after the designers complete <strong>GUI 201</strong>, they might want to provide the user the ability to <strong>organize the favorites</strong> into categories, <strong>export groups</strong> of favorites to share with others, add the ability to <strong>create a playlist</strong>, and open a favorite in a <strong>new window</strong>.  When you are dealing with a computer and not a real-world physical device just about anything is possible.

<p>Today, I would like to write about a novel idea called Machine Programming (MP). I was following research in this area during the last year or so. I think it has the potential to revolutionize the way how we develop software. MP ignite a special interest in me since at that time I was writing my <a href="https://book.easyperf.net/perf_book">book</a>. I was thinking to myself, like “Oh-oh, if MP would be working full-steam today, my book shouldn’t have existed”.</p>

<p>So, what is Machine Programming? It is a bold idea to automate the entire software development cycle, including writing the code, testing, debugging, and maintaining it. MP is driven by MIT, Berkley, Intel, Google, and other big names and certainly gains traction in the industry.</p>

<p>The main driving force for this initiative is a futuristic vision that everyone would be able to program computers. Right now, it is a privilege of only 1% of the population in the world. That’s right, 99% of the population on the planet cannot program machines. This could become possible if we enable machines to understand human intention without the need to write the actual code. In the MP vision, the machine will do all the tedious work, including creating the code and verifying that it accomplishes the goal.</p>

<p>Secondly, the world becomes increasingly heterogeneous, which I talk about in my <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2020/12/30/Computing-Industry-2020">previous post</a>. The truth is that no one can program that many devices. The initiatives like <a href="https://www.oneapi.com/">OneAPI</a> may definitely help here by providing a simple standardized way of programming various devices. But still, there will be a lot of complexity for creating an efficient implementation of that API. An example I have in mind is: at Intel, we have many performance libraries that provide highly tuned routines for math primitives, linear algebra, memory management, etc. This is a tone of code that is written by experts and is very complicated. Automation has to come in some form to ease the production and maintaining the lower-layer code.</p>

<p>Machine Programming is largely applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques. But ML usually allows some inaccuracy in results. If a face recognition feature on your iPhone fails once per month, we could live with that, no one will die. But with MP, we can’t allow the machine to misinterpret human’s intention. So, Machine Programming also uses formal methods to verify its correctness.</p>

<h3 id="a-high-level-vision">A high-level vision</h3>

<p>At a high level, Machine Programming relies on three pillars, as denoted in the original visionary paper<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intention</strong>. It is an interface between a human and a machine. It allows a human to specify their intention in any form. It could be a UML diagram, pseudocode, or even natural language. Regardless of the format, the machine should be able to adapt. It’s like you communicate your idea to the machine. And once it understood what you want from it, it says: “Ok, give me a few hours, I’ll build it for you”. Taking into consideration Elon’s Musk NeuraLink technology, this isn’t something that is out of reach.</li>
  <li><strong>Invention</strong>. Once the intention is understood, the machine creates all the necessary components to achieve the desired goal, like algorithms and data structures, the need for network communication, etc. It is still relatively high-level and the “design” created by the machine is SW and HW agnostic.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptation</strong>. The third step in this process is to specialize the “design” (a result of the invention step) to the particular HW and SW ecosystem, e.g. create an implementation, like compile it down to the machine code, optimize and verify that it is working.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://easyperf.net/img/posts/MP/ThreePillars.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The bold idea of MP is that humans should only specify the intention. The rest should be handled by the machine, like choosing the best algorithm and data structure, implement the code and verify it against the human intention. The research in the MP area is nowhere near having a generalized solution to a problem described previously. But there is early evidence that it may be possible. The people that drive the MP research showed that they could solve the issue for a very small and constrained problem. You can find more details in the papers referenced at the end of the article.</p>

<h3 id="code-similarity-analysis">Code similarity analysis</h3>

<p>Personally, I’m interested in MP as it promises to revolutionize performance engineering. The problem today is that there is a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2366231.2337210">Ninja Gap</a> that can be defined as a performance gap between the code written by casual developers and the code written by performance experts. Let it not surprise you that the ninja gap can be as high as 10x or even more. If we can “mine” the code written by performance ninjas and recommend it for casual developers to reuse, the gap can be conquered. To effectively suggest the right code candidate to reuse, we need to be able to classify the snippet of code and to tell if two different snippets of code are similar. This would be nice if we could have a collection of golden code, classified by the semantics of the code. The machine will go like: “Oh, I see you’re sorting the array of small-sized objects. Here is the best implementation of it, tuned for the target configuration”.</p>

<p>The ability to classify the code, opens many new opportunities, like building recommendation systems, that will recommend the code that might be better. On a very high-level, we need to train the database of golden code, where each class of code snippets will have its own fingerprint. Then, we will be able to query this golden database for recommendations. The core challenge here is to extract the semantics of the code, for example, being able to tell: “this code does sorting or matrix multiplication, etc”.</p>

<p><img src="https://easyperf.net/img/posts/MP/Recommendation.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Code similarity analysis is still in the early stages, but there is a growing body of research in this area. The problem can be stated as the following: given 2 pieces of code, we try to detect if they do a similar thing, even if their implementation is different. The latest state-of-the-art tools that address code similarity problem are Aroma and MISM:</p>

<p><strong>Aroma</strong><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Aroma is a code recommendation system that takes a code snippet and recommends extensions for the snippet. The intuition behind Aroma is that programmers often write code that may have already been written. Aroma leverages a codebase of functions and recommends extensions in a live setting. Aroma introduces the simplified parse tree (SPT) - a tree structure to represent a code snippet. Unlike an AST, an SPT is not language-specific and enables code similarity comparison across various programming languages. To compute the similarity score of two code snippets, Aroma extracts binary feature vectors from SPTs and calculate their dot product. Below is the example that the paper authors give in their paper. Original Java code doesn’t properly close the input stream and handles any potential IOException. Code lines recommended by Aroma are highlighted in yellow.</p>

<p><img src="https://easyperf.net/img/posts/MP/Aroma.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The paper authors evaluated Aroma by indexing over 2 million Java methods and performed searches with code snippets chosen from the popular Stack Overflow questions. Think of it as you would search on Stack Overflow how to properly close an input stream in Java. Results showed that Aroma was able to provide useful recommendations for a majority of these snippets.</p>

<p><strong>MISIM</strong><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. MISIM is a novel code similarity tool, which claims to be more accurate than Aroma. MISIM is based on Context-Aware Parse Tree (CAPT<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>), which enhances SPT by providing a richer level of semantic representation. CAPT provides additional support for language-specific techniques, and language-agnostic techniques for removing syntactically-present but semantically irrelevant features.</p>

<p><img src="https://easyperf.net/img/posts/MP/CodeSimilarity.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Then MISIM employs a neural-based code similarity scoring algorithm to compute the similarity score of two input programs. According to the research paper, an experimental evaluation showed that MISIM outperforms three other state-of-the-art code similarity systems (including Aroma) usually by a large factor (up to 43x).</p>

<h3 id="detecting-performance-regressions">Detecting performance regressions</h3>

<p>Another area where MP is showing significant progress in detecting performance regressions. It is becoming a trend that SW vendors try to increase the frequency of deployments. Unfortunately, this doesn’t automatically imply that SW products become better with each new release. Software performance regressions are defects that are erroneously introduced into software as it evolves from one version to the next. Performance regressions can be treated as anomalies that represent deviations from the normal behavior of a program.</p>

<p>AutoPerf<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> is a new framework for software performance regression diagnostics, which fuses multiple state-of-the-art techniques from hardware telemetry and machine learning to create a unique solution to the problem. First, AutoPerf leverages hardware performance counters (HWPCs) to collect fine-grained information about run-time executions of a program. Then it utilizes zero-positive learning (ZPL<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>) for anomaly detection, and k-means clustering to build a general and practical tool based on collected data. AutoPerf can learn to diagnose potentially any type of regression that can be captured by HWPCs, with minimal supervision. The overview of Autoperf workflow is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p><img src="https://easyperf.net/img/posts/MP/Autoperf.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The authors of the tool showed that this design can effectively diagnose some of the most complex software performance bugs, like those hidden in parallel programs. However, even the tool can detect performance regressions, it still cannot identify the root cause of such bugs yet.</p>

<h3 id="enhance-debugging">Enhance debugging</h3>

<p>The last interesting research that I would like to share today aims to enhance SW debugging, which has been shown to utilize at least 50% (!) of developers’ time. The high-level vision of Machine Programming with regards to debugging is to provide suggestions about a potential bug. The general goal is to have a machine operate …</p></div></div>

I begin this essay with a brief reflection on where we are on our journey as a digital species, as well as the role the games industry is playing in it. From there, we will touch on the origins of the concept of the Metaverse before exploring its more recent incarnation. Despite aspects of it gradually coming into focus, it remains a nebulous idea. As such, we look at some of the core characteristics that the internet of tomorrow is likely to possess whilst recognizing that the evolution of technologies are usually unpredictable. <strong>Having established an idea of where things <em>could</em> go, I will explain why I think the tools afforded by crypto are necessary to get there.</strong> We’ll look at some of the driving forces behind our current trajectory, and why crypto technologies may be one of the most imperative yet least recognised components of our evolving digital world. From there we explore areas of application, paths to adoption, new business models being unlocked, and how the investable surface area is expanding. I close out with some key areas of focus for various parties that may be interested in the hope it provides someone with something of use.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Introduction</p></li><li><p>Enter The Metaverse</p></li><li><p>Where Does Crypto Come In?</p></li><li><p>What Needs To Happen?</p></li><li><p>A Path To Adoption</p></li><li><p>New Business Models</p></li><li><p>Investable Surface Area</p></li><li><p>Takeaways</p></li><li><p>Conclusion</p></li></ol><h3><strong>TL;DR</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Crypto is laying the foundations for a self-sovereign financial system, an open creator economy, and a universal digital representation and ownership layer via NFTs (non-fungible tokens).</p></li><li><p>The Metaverse is coming; trends indicate our direction of travel.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611439119986_8557"><div><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>It is easy to forget that it has been just 50 years since the ARPANET delivered the first two letters of the word ‘login’ before crashing. The fact that the first message ever to be transmitted over the precursor to the internet was ‘<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5275828/">lo</a>’ will always be suspiciously fitting. These events took place on the year of the moon landing, a full 20 years before the emergence of the world wide web. The impact of this technology has turned out to be truly astonishing, yet we are undergoing further acceleration. In just half a century, it has connected 63% of the human race to one another. Right now, digitally transmitted words that represent ideas are forming inside your head that were typed by a completely separate member of your species with whom you have no physical contact. <strong>The capacity for complex communication is the primary differentiator between us and other living beings; it is the core foundation of society building organisms.</strong> The grand web of information that we have built throughout our brief existence is absolutely fundamental to humanity. Over the years, both the nature of and our relationship to that web of information has evolved dramatically. From the earliest transmissions of knowledge from our ancestors through cave drawings and storytelling, to the emergence of written language eventually leading to the Gutenberg revolution. More recently, photography and telephony unlocked ways to transmit information through time and space that were strange at first.</p><p>Now we, especially my generation (‘99 baby), take all of that for granted. Covid-19, of course, served as a useful reminder to many of our sheer dependence on it. Yet still, there is little pause for reflection on the remarkable digital tapestry of modern life woven by the hands of almost 5 billion people. We regularly record and transmit information to one another all around the globe without an inkling of <em>where</em> the recipients might be, oftentimes <em>who</em> they might be, and even <em>when</em> they might exist. The degree to which information is both preserved and accessible is simply unprecedented. Connecting with ideas and others is becoming increasingly easy as well as vivid. Historically, a letter may have been your best bet. As communication technologies have evolved, perhaps a phone call with a loved one brings you closer together due to the higher empathetic bandwidth of voice. Better still, we can now video conference and see those with whom we are speaking. Peeking behind the curtain of virtual reality, we are now beginning to see the ability to share social presence and spatial awareness with other people by “physically” sharing the same environment. If that evolves to become a dominant communication technology, what else has to change with it? What might come next?</p><p>One of the applications of the internet that appears to have resonated the most with us as a species is the ability to play with one another at scale. Its wide appeal has been a primary driver in the evolution of networking and graphics technologies. <strong>There are presently over 2.7 billion video game players globally, that’s 1 in 3 people.</strong> Every day, the veins of the web pulse with information as ever-improving experiences absorb attention and capture an increasing portion of the global mindshare. Throughout the history of gaming, despite the ebbs and flows of trends both ephemeral and sticky, the concept of video games and virtual environments has reached an unimaginable audience. We have observed radical changes ricochet throughout the industry as new business models have demanded the delivery of entirely new infrastructure sets. Perhaps most potently, the increased feasibility of digital distribution paired with the advent of mobile in the late noughties drove drastic advancements in what it meant to be a developer. Suddenly the arsenal of a large game publisher grew to include: data science tools, massively scalable synchronous web services, widely accessible low latency databases, live operations including customer support, content management and live-service updates, and high-impact marketing campaigns as increased optionality began to reveal the fickle nature of gamers. <strong>The underlying business model shift that drove this activity was a gravitation towards free-to-play (F2P) subsidised by micro-transactions, which now accounts for 78% of digital game revenue (2020).</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611439119986_22225"><div>

Typically we assume that if we get more things done each day, we’re highly productive. But the assumption couldn’t be more wrong.</p><p>Productivity is not about getting all things done, it’s about getting the most important things done, those with the most impact to reach your goals.</p><p>When we think of someone productive, a friend or colleague, we tend to picture someone “busy” pushing through those tasks ticking them off one by one, trapped under an ever-growing pile of work. </p><p>It’s easy to think that busy people with a lot of output are productive, but the actual work they produce might be of little use. Being busy with many tasks, work-responsibilities, and long working hours does not mean that you are productive.</p><p>To become more productive, focus on the tasks that bring you closer to your goals, and consistently do so. Not everything is essential. No matter what you’re working on, there are tasks that you shouldn’t do or delegate, and only a few that are truly important.</p><p><strong>James Clear</strong>, the author of bestseller Atomic Habits, puts it in this way:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span> “Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum on everything.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong>, author and productivity guru, says:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>“Productivity is when you focus on relevant output, getting the right things done. Things that improve your career, business, organization.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-does-productivity-mean-to-you">What does productivity mean to you?</h2><p>Before you put your head down and start thinking about becoming more productive, think about “why” you have this urge, what’s driving you. A standard answer that you might think of is; having more free time to do the things you enjoy doing. </p><p>If you can do more with less, surely you can reach your goals sooner, leaving you with time to focus on other goals in life. Is it a career goal you have, more time to read books, more time with your family or friends? Having clarity around what’s driving your actions will help you when things get tough.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-increasing-personal-productivity">What are the benefits of increasing personal productivity?</h2><p>We all have 24 hours in a day, it’s up to each of us to determine how we want to use those hours. Productive people get more done with less effort, allowing them to focus on what was driving them in the first place. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There are clear benefits of improving your personal productivity, focus on the tasks with the most impact, the right things, and you’ll achieve more, and get better results.</p><p>Other benefits can be:</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce Stress</strong><br>When you become more organized and start to achieve your most impactful tasks on time, you will feel less stressed. Instead of running around trying to accomplish everything, you can focus on what matters the most. Your personal well-being increases, e.g., you feel happy and comfortable.</li><li><strong>Increase Engagement</strong><br>Increased productivity and engagement are closely related to each other. More productive people are usually also more passionate and engaged in the work they do. <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/employee-engagement-does-more">Harvard Business Review</a> pointed out that higher engagement leads to a 22% increase in productivity. </li><li><strong>Improve self-confidence</strong><br>Improving productivity also allows you to learn more in less time. And, when you get better at what you do, you’ll also increase your confidence. In other words, productive people will learn more, get better at what they do, and become more self-confident.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-become-more-productive">How to become more productive</h2><p>As highlighted earlier in this article, it’s a significant difference between “movement” and “achievement.” Checking off tasks will allow you to feel more accomplished, but it won’t ensure that you move closer to your goals. Whatever strategy or technique you go with, and there are plenty to choose from, the most important thing to remember is to go with the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Like everything else in life, to make a change, it requires time and focus. So you need to look for a strategy that you can stick with and create a habit around.</p><p>To get you started, <strong>here are some of the most common and practical productivity strategies:</strong></p><h2 id="the-pomodoro-method">The Pomodoro Method</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most known and researched methods out there, and for a good reason, it’s simple and it works. This method can help you keep focus by getting things done in shorter bursts. </p><p>In-between, you take frequent breaks that can either be short or long, depending on how many tasks you’ve completed. You don’t need any particular tools to get started, all you need is a timer. In short, here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Start on a task that you want to accomplish</li><li>Set the timer on 25 minutes (This block is referred to as the “Pomodoro”)</li><li>Work on the task until the timer rings, put a checkmark on a paper</li><li>Take a 5-minutes break</li><li>After completing 4 “Pomodoros” take a 15-20 minutes break</li></ul><p>The main idea behind this popular technique is that the timer creates a sense of urgency, allowing you to keep focused and not give in to distractions. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/">Learn more about the Pomodoro Method.</a> </p><h2 id="eat-that-frog-method">Eat That Frog Method</h2><p>Mark Twain once said, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Applied to the real world, the “frog” would symbolize the most impactful and essential task you have to complete on a given day, week, or month. </p><p>If you eat that frog in the morning, or when you are the most productive, then you’ll get more done. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/eat-that-frog/">Learn more about the Eat that Frog method.</a></p><h2 id="the-eisenhower-matrix">The Eisenhower Matrix</h2><p>Former President and five-star general, Dwight Eisenhower, had an extraordinary capability of being productive for more extended periods. One of his most essential productivity strategies is called the Eisenhower Matrix (or Box), and it’s a simple decision-making tool that you can easily incorporate in your daily routines. </p><p>The matrix labels tasks, depending on their level of importance and urgency. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/">how to use the Eisenhower Matrix in this article.</a></p><h2 id="focus-on-one-thing">Focus on ONE thing</h2><p>A productive person doesn’t necessarily do more work, they focus their work on the right things. And If you then focus your energy on “one” right thing after the other, you’ll accomplish more, and you’re likely to achieve your goals quicker. </p><p>This is, however, not just about focusing on one thing in your life period. It’s about being critical of what you choose to focus your energy on, where you have the most impact, and eliminate waste. Hone in on what matters and let go of everything else. This technique is not as simple as it may sound, but if you learn to master it, you can achieve almost anything. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">how focusing on one thing can help you.</a></p><h2 id="the-ivy-lee-method">The Ivy Lee Method</h2><p>This 100-years old, 15-minutes method has been used by many professionals to increase their productivity. Why does it work? It’s dead simple. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>At the end of each day, write down the six most important tasks that you need to complete the following day. Not more than six.</li><li>Prioritize and stack rank these tasks in order of importance</li><li>Next day, start with your most important task and don’t more to the next task until you’ve completed the first one.</li><li>Work through the list of the tasks in the prioritized order.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this post, I introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_formulation_of_classical_electromagnetism">covariant electrodynamics</a> in the least painful way I know: by extending the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_product#Vector_triple_product">vector triple product</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space">Minkowski spacetime</a>. The reader is assumed to have some familiarity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector">four-vectors</a> and Euclidean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus">vector calculus</a>, but we won’t use any index gymnastics or explicit rank-2 tensors; just four-vectors. (In <a href="https://michaelallenwarner.github.io/physics/2020/03/31/electrodyadics.html">Part II</a> we’ll use dyadics, which are like “tensors lite.”)</p>

<p>I developed this approach myself, and I’ve found no other sources that employ it. If you’ve seen it elsewhere, please let me know (email address at the bottom of the page).</p>

<h2 id="mathematical-preliminaries">Mathematical Preliminaries</h2>

<h3 id="the-bac---cab-rule">The “bac - cab” Rule</h3>

<p>In three-dimensional Euclidean space, we have this lovely vector identity:</p><p>

\[\mathbf a \times (\mathbf b \times \mathbf c) = \mathbf b (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - \mathbf c (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b) .\]

</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a> \(\mathbf b \times \mathbf c\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf b\) and \(\mathbf c\) and defined only in three dimensions (where an axis that’s orthogonal to a pair of vectors is unique). The vector triple product \(\mathbf a \times (\mathbf b \times \mathbf c)\), on the other hand, is a linear combination of \(\mathbf b\) and \(\mathbf c\), which is to say that it’s a vector that <em>lies in the plane they span</em> (its direction is given by the projection of \(\mathbf a\) onto that plane, rotated 90° in the \(\mathbf c\)-to-\(\mathbf b\) sense—see the illustration below <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Cross_product_triple.svg">from Wikipedia</a>, but don’t let it mislead you into thinking that the vector’s <em>magnitude</em> is necessarily equal to that of \(\mathbf a\)’s projection onto the plane). So although the cross product is restricted to three-dimensional Euclidean space, there’s nothing stopping us from using the “bac - cab” combination in other contexts.</p>

<h3 id="four-vector-triple-product">Four-Vector Triple Product</h3>

<p>Accordingly, we can define a “vector triple product” in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime:</p><p>

\[\mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\mathbf B \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) = \mathbf B (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) - \mathbf C (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf B).\]

</p><p>Here the dot means the <em>Minkowski</em> dot product (we’ll use capital letters for four-vectors in this post), and the scare quotes on the left side remind us that the cross product itself isn’t actually defined in Minkowski spacetime (don’t take the \(\times\) notation literally!).</p>

<p>If you need a refresher, a four-vector in standard Minkowski coordinates has one time component and three Cartesian spatial components that together obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation">Lorentz transformation</a>. Adopting the \((+, -, -, -)\) sign convention, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector#Standard_basis,_(+%E2%88%92%E2%88%92%E2%88%92)_signature">Minkowski dot product</a> of \(\mathbf Q = (Q^t, Q^x, Q^y, Q^z) = (Q^t, \mathbf q)\) and \(\mathbf W = (W^t, \mathbf w)\) is:</p><p>

\[\mathbf Q \cdot \mathbf W = Q^t W^t - (\mathbf q \cdot \mathbf w) ,\]

</p><p>where \(\mathbf q \cdot \mathbf w = q_x w_x + q_y w_y + q_z w_z = Q^x W^x + Q^y W^y + Q^z W^z\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">Euclidean dot product</a> (we’ll use superscript indices for four-vector components and subscript indices for three-vector components).</p>

<h3 id="adding-curl-to-the-mix">Adding Curl to the Mix</h3>

<p>A special case of the vector triple product is when the “inner” cross product is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)">curl</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">vector field</a> \(\mathbf c = \mathbf c (\mathbf r)\) (using \(\mathbf r\) for the position vector):</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf a \times (\del \times \mathbf c) &amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - \mathbf c (\mathbf a \cdot \del _{\mathbf c}) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \mathbf c ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Special_notations">subscript</a> indicates that \(\del\) (“del”) operates on \(\mathbf c\) and only on \(\mathbf c\), regardless of its placement in a term. Note that because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Curl_of_gradient_is_zero">curl of a gradient</a> is always the zero vector, this differential vector triple product is unchanged by a transformation that takes \(\mathbf c\) to (\(\mathbf c + \del f\)) for <em>any</em> scalar field \(f = f (\mathbf r)\):</p><p>

\[\mathbf a \times [\del \times (\mathbf c + \del f)] = \mathbf a \times (\del \times \mathbf c) ,\]

</p><p>or using the “bac - cab” expansion:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf a \times [\del \times (\mathbf c + \del f)] &amp;= \del _{\mathbf c \, + \del f} \, [\mathbf a \cdot (\mathbf c + \del f)] - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) (\mathbf c + \del f) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) + \del _{f} (\mathbf a \cdot \del f) - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \mathbf c - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \del f \\[3pt]
&amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \mathbf c \\[3pt]
&amp;= \mathbf a \times (\del \times \mathbf c),
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>because for the scalar \(f\) we have \(\del _{f} (\mathbf a \cdot \del f) = \del _{f} (\mathbf a \cdot \del) f = (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \del f\) (if you need convincing write it out in terms of components).</p>

<p>The “four-del” is:</p><p>

\[\vecpartial = \left( \frac{1}{c} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial t} , \, - \del \right)\]

</p><p>(\(c\) is the speed of light, and yes, that’s a negative sign—without it the four “components” <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_25.html#Ch25-S3">wouldn’t obey the Lorentz transformation</a> and thus wouldn’t together constitute a four-vector operator). With \(\mathbf R\) as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector#Four-position">four-position</a>, the <em>Minkowski</em> differential vector triple product for a four-vector field \(\mathbf C = \mathbf C ( \mathbf R )\) is:</p><p>

\[\mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) = \vecpartial _{\mathbf C} (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C .\]

</p><p>The resulting vector is likewise unchanged by a transformation that takes \(\mathbf C\) to (\(\mathbf C + \vecpartial F\)) for any spacetime scalar field \(F = F (\mathbf R)\), though now we can <em>only</em> show this with the “bac - cab” side:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times [ \vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, ( \mathbf C + \vecpartial F ) ] &amp;= \vecpartial _{\mathbf C \, + \, \vecpartial F} \, [\mathbf A \cdot (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F)] - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial _{\mathbf C} (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) + (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \vecpartial F - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \vecpartial F \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial _{\mathbf C} (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C \\[3pt]
&amp;= \mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C).
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="the-double-curl">The Double Curl</h3>

<p>Then there’s the <em>extra</em> special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Curl_of_curl">curl of the curl</a>, which outputs a vector <em>field</em>:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\del \times (\del \times \mathbf c) &amp;= \del (\del \cdot \mathbf c) - (\del \cdot \del) \mathbf c \\[2pt]
&amp;= \del (\del \cdot \mathbf c) - \nabla^2 \mathbf c ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>with \(\nabla^2 = \del \cdot \del\) as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Laplacian">(vector) Laplacian</a>, a scalar operator. The four-vector “double curl” is:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) &amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) - (\vecpartial \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C \\[2pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) - \Box \mathbf C ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>with \(\Box = \vecpartial \cdot \vecpartial\) as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert_operator">d’Alembertian</a>. Taking \(\mathbf C\) to (\(\mathbf C + \vecpartial F\)) here looks like:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times [ \vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, ( \mathbf C + \vecpartial F ) ] &amp;= \vecpartial [\vecpartial \cdot (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F)] - \Box (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) + \vecpartial \Box F - \Box \mathbf C - \Box \vecpartial F \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) - \Box \mathbf C \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>where we’ve used \(\Box \vecpartial = \vecpartial \Box\) (because \(\Box\) is a scalar operator).</p>

<h2 id="covariant-electrodynamics-four-vectors-only">Covariant Electrodynamics, Four-Vectors Only</h2>

<p>The physics is really pretty simple now. We’ll do this in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz%E2%80%93Heaviside_units">Heaviside–Lorentz units</a>.</p>

<h3 id="four-current-density-four-potential-lorenz-gauge">Four-Current Density, Four-Potential, Lorenz Gauge</h3>

<p>Charge- and current-densities together constitute a four-vector \(\mathbf J = (\rho, \, \mathbf j / c)\) called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-current">four-current density</a>, which is the electromagnetic source field. (Usually it’s defined as \((\rho c , \, \mathbf j)\), but dividing by \(c\) now saves us from having to divide \(\mathbf J\) by \(c\) later when it appears in other equations.) We then define the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_four-potential">four-potential</a> \(\mathbf A\) as any four-vector field whose (negative) “double curl” is the four-current density:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf J &amp;= - \vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf A) \\[2pt]
&amp;= \Box \mathbf A - \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf A) .
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>We haven’t yet established why we’d care about the four-potential, but this equation tells us how the “value” of \(\mathbf A\) at a given spacetime location is determined by the value of \(\mathbf J\) elsewhere in spacetime. Scare quotes around <em>value</em> because \(\mathbf A\) isn’t uniquely defined: remember, the above differential triple product is unchanged by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#Classical_electromagnetism">“gauge” transformation</a> that takes \(\mathbf A\) to (\(\mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi\)) for <em>any</em> spacetime scalar field \(\psi\). And look what happens if we choose a \(\psi\) that satisfies \(\Box \psi = - \vecpartial \cdot \mathbf A\):</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\Box ( \mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi ) - \vecpartial [ \vecpartial \cdot ( \mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi ) ] &amp;= \Box ( \mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi ) - \vecpartial ( \vecpartial \cdot \mathbf A + \Box \psi ) \\[2pt]

<p>We have very simple bacteria, living in a world where
there is plenty of food, but radiation kills.</p>

<p>On every cycle bacteria reproduce and take more radiation;
when they have enough radiation, they die.</p>

<p>Whenever a bacterium reproduces, it transmits along its
own <code>:max</code> resistence to radiation; while newborns
have zero total radiation.</p>

<p>The world is limited to <code>WORLD_SIZE</code> items, represented
internally as a vector of all living bacteria; on each turn,
bacteria are shuffled in a random sequence and only
the number specified in <code>WORLD_SIZE</code> survive.</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>

<p>Fire up your repl and type:</p>

<p>First you create a gene pool, with only 1 bacterium with a
radiation resistance of 100, and 99 with a resistance of 30:</p>

<p><code>(def POOL (flatten [(mk-bacts 100 1) (mk-bacts 30 99)]))</code></p>

<p>then you run a number of runs of the game. Each run is the time
needed for reproduction; as a reference, in <em>E. Coli</em> under
ideal conditions, it takes about 20 minutes.</p>

<p><code>(run-game POOL 300)</code></p>

<p>Again, for <em>E. Coli</em> this is about 2 days. You'll be impressed
at how quickly the system</p>

<h2>But why?</h2>

<p>I wanted to show my kids how quickly blind evolution is able
to spread advances in the gene pool, and how it works in
practice.</p>

<p>It ends up as one screenshot of Clojure, including documentation,
so it's not bad.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>
</td><td><pre>(def WORLD_SIZE 10000)</pre></td></tr><tr><td><p>Build one <strong>bacterium</strong>.</p>

<p>  So far it only has two attributes:</p>

</ul>
</td><td><pre>(defn bact
  [curr max]

       (range num)))</pre></td></tr><tr><td><p>Runs one <strong>turn</strong> for one bacterium.</p>

<p>  Returns a vector of 0 or more bacteria, as on each turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>if it's got too much radiation, it dies -&gt; returns no elements</li>
<li>if not, the original bacterium is  returned with more radiation,

<p>  So far, it prints a vector of the <code>:max</code> gene, and
  how many items have this gene.</p>

<p>  E.g. <code>{[50 100] [30 400]}</code> means that there are
  100 bacteeria with <code>:max</code> =  50 and 400 with
  <code>:max</code> =  30 (and theey won't last long - hee hee hee).</p>

<p>  This could definitely be improved.</p>

  [all-bacteria]
  (map
   (fn [[k v]] [k (count v)])
   (group-by :max all-bacteria)))</pre></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Runs a game.</h2>

<p>  You start it with a vector of bacteria, that you can
  create in bulk with the <code>mk-bacts</code> function, and
  specify a number of turns for this to run.</p>

<p>  On each turn, statistics are printed so you know the
  relative prevalence of <code>:max</code> genes on the gene pool.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://cdaringe.github.io/factorio-type-kit/posts/get-started | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cdaringe.github.io/factorio-type-kit/posts/get-started">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Of course</strong> we want type safety when programming Factorio mods. Unfortunately, Factorio's Lua modding API offers no such provisions. Good news! <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a> helps bridge that gap via TypeScript. While TypeScript doesn't offer
the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>
<h2>Factorio in TypeScript - Outline</h2>
<p>We will execute the following steps later, but at a glance, here are the general required steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#using-a-script-macoslinux">fnm</a> for installing and managing nodejs installations.</li>
<li>(optional) Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">yarn</a>. <code>npm</code> is the default package manager for nodejs, but the following document uses <code>yarn</code>. It takes only moments to install.</li>
<li>Setup a <code>nodejs</code> project</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation">typescript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua">TypeScriptToLua</a></li>
<li>Configure the typescript compiler to use TypeScriptToLua</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Package &amp; deploy the mod</li>
</ol>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>
<pre><code>~/src/vroom via ⬢ v15.0.1
❯ ls -alh
Permissions Size User     Date Modified Name

 <!-- `.trim()} /> -->
<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
  "copy:install": "VERSION=$(cat info.json | jq -r .version) &amp;&amp; rsync -r --exclude node_modules --exclude '.git*' --exclude build --exclude 'npm*' --exclude README.md --exclude package.json --exclude '*.lock'  ./ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom_$VERSION/",

<p><strong><a href="https://www.mysterywire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MYSTERY WIRE</a> —</strong> Is there credible evidence to support the existence of an afterlife? A Las Vegas businessman says he will spend a million dollars to find out.</p>



<p>Las Vegas space entrepreneur Robert Bigelow, known for his funding of UFO research projects, has launched a new project.</p>



<p>Today, the <a href="http://www.bigelowinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bigelow Institute for Consciousness Studies</a> (BICS) announced a global essay contest. BICS is seeking input from scientists, religious scholars, consciousness researchers, and anyone else who can provide evidence of an afterlife.</p>



<p>As an incentive, BICS will award $500,000 for the top essay, $300,000 for the second best, and $150,000 for third place.</p>



<p>“The Bigelow Institute for Consciousness Studies, was formed to try to conduct research and facilitate research into the possibility of the survival of human consciousness beyond bodily death, Bigelow told Mystery Wire in an exclusive interview, “and, if that is true, then to explore what is the other side all about?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this excerpt from our wide-ranging interview, Bigelow shared more about the mission of BICS, the rules for the contest, and the current state of research into the survival of human consciousness.</p>

<p>Bigelow, the founder and owner of Bigelow Aerospace as well as the hotel chain Budget Suites of America, has spent millions of dollars to pursue two enduring mysteries, namely, is there other intelligent life in the universe and whether human consciousness continues after physical death.</p>





<p>In the mid 1990’s, he created the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), a think tank and research program which investigated UFO issues, as well as survival of consciousness.</p>



<p>NIDS was guided by a Science Advisory Board made up of eminent scientists, astronauts, academics, and intelligence officers.</p>







<p>In 2008, a subsidiary of Bigelow Aerospace called the Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS) , signed a contract with the Defense Intelligence Agency to investigate UFOs, as well as a wide range of related mysteries. The existence of the secret Pentagon study was made public in 2017.</p>



<p>Bigelow told us his interest in human consciousness and a possible afterlife was largely the result of personal losses, including the deaths of his father, son, grandson and wife.&nbsp; He was motivated to find out if his loved ones might still exist in some other reality.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong><em>RELATED:</em></strong> <a href="https://www.mysterywire.com/mysteries/surviving-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Surviving Death: Examining what happens when you cross over and return</a></h2>



<p>In this excerpt from the Mystery Wire interview, Bigelow explained the origins of BICS and why he is prepared to support credible research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert Bigelow rarely grants interviews and has never answered questions on the record about the BAASS/DIA study. However, he opened up to Mystery Wire about his UFO investigations, his ownership of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mysterywire.com/mysteries/skinwalker-ranch-remains-a-puzzle-to-scientists-after-years-of-study/" target="_blank">Skinwalker Ranch</a>, his interactions with UFO whistleblower <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mysterywire.com/ufo/area-51-alien-stories-rooted-in-bob-lazars-legacy/" target="_blank">Bob Lazar</a>, and many other subjects.</p>



<p>Interview segments regarding those topics will be released by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mysterywire.com/" target="_blank">Mystery Wire</a> tomorrow and in the days ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I was sitting at work, coming up with a way to solve some synchronization issue between our relational database and a search index, it got me thinking… Is it possible to have a database that can handle this stuff for me, the way, for example, Postgres handles the creation and maintenance of an index? Just one <strong>CREATE INDEX</strong> away from efficient and fast queries. What about a database that can serve every need: storing and reading data effectively, scaling smoothly as the workload increases, being able to run complex searches, do batch and stream processing for analytical purposes and work with every other access pattern we can imagine.</p><p>Almost any organization that handles data uses a relational database in its stack. It makes sense, it’s a battle-tested technology that stood the test of time. For a large percent of the applications, the need won’t arise for a different kind of data system. Take Postgres for example: it’s highly scalable, it has transactions with ACID properties, materialized views, supports partitioning and replication, joins, views, triggers, stored procedures, hot backups, all that kind of stuff. We can go
along way with it without having to worry about problems with the dataflow in our system. But of course, not all data models are suitable for Postgres, and even though it supports things like full-text searches and JSON columns, some times it is more suitable or easier even, to use different technology.</p><p>But even though relational databases have come a very long way, still they are not designed to handle every possible workload, so we resort to having to combine multiple systems to handle this broad variety: we use Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for searching, Kafka for stream processing, and many more similar tools and technologies, each of them serving a very narrow purpose in handling our different use cases.</p><p>But is there a way to unify the interface across these systems?</p><p>These technologies are great at what they do, we just need something that nicely ties them together instead of putting that burden on our applications. Putting the application in this role is too much of a responsibility, storing and transporting the data from one place to another as well as handling all of the business logic is a sure way of making those systems permanently inconsistent with each other.</p><p>Instead, if we can figure out a way of making these diverse components work nicely together, we will have a much more reliable solution. Kinda like the pipe in Unix, allowing the user to compose different workflows together out of simpler programs, by sending the output of one command to another, for further processing.</p><p>Now I know there are tools today that handle some of these cases that I mentioned, and they are getting better each day, but they’re far from simple to operate and maintain, and more importantly, they’re not of declarative nature.</p><p>Instead of relying on tools, is it possible to have some abstraction akin to SQL, some declarative language that will hide away the complexities of storing and synchronizing the data across the different data systems, making it easier to combine the disparate technologies, while also providing escape hatches in case the need arises to access the underlying storage directly?</p><p>Taking inspiration from the UNIX philosophy which emphasizes building complex systems out of simpler, extensible, and modular components, can we apply the same principles here, to our future data systems?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  		<p><span>I spent a significant amount of my career in the role of a dedicated testing specialist. I worked at Microsoft leading a variety of cross-company initiatives when we had 10,000 testers at the company. We worked closely with development teams and, at the time, made a difference in product quality. For most of that time, developers generally did a small bit of testing, but our test teams performed the vast majority of all testing efforts, including extensive suites of verification tests enhanced with a flurry of diagnostic tools and a healthy dose of exploratory testing and investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>Somewhere in my tester journey, Microsoft moved from a mix of testers with and without programming experience to a model where all testers knew how to program, and I was a fly on the wall when we came up with the title for the infamous <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2018/11/06/the-software-engineer-in-test/">SDET</a> role. There were many good (and some not so good) reasons for this move that are outside the focus of this post. One thing I remember from some folks opposed to the move was a notion that testers who knew how to program could not do effective testing because they were “skewed” by their understanding of how the code works. The feeling of these people was that the testing mindset is separate from the developer mindset 🧠 – that if you had one, you couldn’t have the other.</span></p>
<p><span>My experiences showed a different story. While I certainly ran across testers who tried too hard to solve every testing challenge with code, most readily and easily took on the role of tester and did deep exploration and investigation in order to understand and evaluate risk. Often, as expected, they would write programs or utilities to accelerate their testing. Their programming skills didn’t </span><i><span>hurt</span></i><span> their testing – their programming skills </span><i><span>enhanced</span></i><span> their testing. The idea of a skewed mindset was a myth.</span></p>
<p><span>For the last several years, I’ve been working on teams without dedicated testers. While these teams often have a few folks (including myself) who have some responsibility for helping the development team do better testing, the developers are responsible for fully testing their code – not just for functional correctness, but for all aspects of quality.</span></p>
<p><span>A few people have stated to me recently that developers are unable to perform testing because “they lack the mindset for skilled testing”. This statement – like the statement I heard many years ago about skewed mindsets is flawed and incorrect.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Mindsets and Skill Sets</strong></h2>
<p><span>Some voices in software development believe that building a product demands a certain mindset, while testing it demands a different mindset.</span></p>
<p><span>The book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322"><i><span>Mindset</span></i></a><span> by Carol S. Dweck says that mindset shapes how you learn and relate to others – and states that you have one of two mindsets – a </span><i><span>fixed</span></i><span> mindset, where you believe your abilities are unchangeable, and a </span><i><span>growth</span></i><span> mindset, where you believe the abilities you’re born with are a starting point for learning and advancing.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> coined the term, </span><i><span>knowledge work</span></i><span> to differentiate work that requires problem-solving and critical thinking from rote factory work. Authors such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717">Daniel Pink</a> (</span><i><span>A Whole New Mind</span></i><span>) have elaborated on the impact of creative thinking in knowledge workers.</span></p>
<p><span>Software development and software testing are knowledge work. Both require multiple skillsets, constant learning, and problem-solving. While developing and testing software may require different problem-solving approaches or skill sets, they are both part of </span><i><span>the same (growth) mindset</span></i><span>, and the best people I know in software can switch between their development/builder and tester/investigator </span><i><span>skill sets </span></i><span>rapidly and fluidly. While I agree that it’s not </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> – with <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2021/01/14/habits-plus-deliberate-practice-equals-mastery/">deliberate and frequent practice</a> shifting between these skill sets, most knowledge workers I’ve worked with can – and have become quite successful in developing this flow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Creators Skill Set&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span>I studied music composition as both an undergraduate and graduate student 🎶 Like building applications and writing, composition requires creation, bound by rules – which are sometimes intentionally broken in order to achieve the creator’s intent – as well as deep analysis and evaluation. As a composer, I constantly had to switch from putting notes on the page to looking at the passage or entire piece as a whole to make sure it achieved my intent. This analysis ranged from verifying notes and voicing were correct to examining every nuance of dynamics and orchestration. Like all metaphors, this one breaks down at some point, but composition skills require both creative (builder) and analysis skill sets (I took multiple courses in each), and the act of composition includes ample amounts of both.</span></p>
<p><span>For most of the last decade, I’ve spent a significant amount of my time helping developers expand their testing knowledge. I’ve watched hundreds of developers grow their knowledge about testing, and then almost immediately apply what they have learned. To be fair, I’ve also seen them make many of the same mistakes that new testers also make, but they’re eager to learn and constantly adjust. Many of these developers are at least as good at <a href="https://testproject.io/">testing</a> as the best testers I know. With no prompting or mindset shifts, most find a way to fluidly shift from the microscope view to the 10,000-foot view and back again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I’ve found in nearly every case is that initially, developers lack the skill sets that experienced testers have mastered. I’ve also seen that developers are completely capable of learning a wide variety of deep testing and investigation skills. I’ve also found that teams where developers have testing skills deliver more quickly, more predictably, and with higher quality.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Making the Shift</strong></h2>
<p><span>I’m not advocating for any software team to eliminate the testing role (although I believe testing expertise is much more suited embedded into the team than in a dedicated test team). But I am firmly against the idea that developers <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/12/09/quality-assurance-is-everyones-responsibility/">shouldn’t do testing</a> or can’t be good testers. I’ve proved that myth wrong dozens if not hundreds of times and colleagues in the industry have shared at least as many examples. <strong>Developers are </strong></span><strong><i>capable</i> of testing, can do testing and we should <i>expect</i></strong><span><strong> them to do testing</strong>. The expert testers of today would be well served by helping them learn and improve these skills.</span></p>
<p><span>We can start by recognizing that we’re all knowledge workers and that a big part of our job satisfaction and growth comes from learning and taking on harder and more challenging tasks. We should also recognize that software development requires a variety of unique skills</span><span>, but not a change in mindset. <strong>We don’t all have to master every skill, but learning, growth, and skill development is something we all can do</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>We just have to put our minds to it 😉</span></p>

      The Duck Hunt gun, officially called the NES Zapper, seems downright primitive next to today’s technology. But in the late ’80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder.</p>

                            For many children of the '80s, a good portion of your childhood probably revolved around sitting too close to the TV, clutching a plastic safety cone-colored hand gun and blasting waterfowl out of a pixilated sky in <em>Duck Hunt </em>(also, trying to blow that dog’s head off when he laughed at you). The <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun, officially called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper, seems downright primitive next to the Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect, but in the late 80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder. How did that thing work?
                        
</p><h4>Annie Get Your Zapper</h4><p>
    
                            The Zapper’s ancestry goes back to the mid 1930s, when the first so-called “light guns” appeared after the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In the first light gun game, <a href="http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/rayolit.htm">Ray-O-Lite</a> (developed in 1936 by Seeburg, a company that made parts and systems for jukeboxes), players shot at small moving targets mounted with light sensors using a gun that emitted a beam of light. When the beam struck a sensor, the targets – ducks, coincidentally – registered the “hit” and a point was scored.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            Light guns hit home video game consoles with <em>Shooting Gallery</em> on the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Because the included shotgun-style light gun was only usable on a Magnavox television, the game flopped. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper then fell into the hands of American kids in October 1985, when it was released in a bundle with the NES, a controller and a few games. Early versions of the peripheral were dark gray, but the color of the sci-fi ray gun-inspired Zapper was changed a few years later when a federal regulation required that toy and imitation firearms be “blaze orange” (color #12199, to be exact) so they wouldn’t be mistaken for the real deal.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            While there were a number of Zapper-compatible games released for the NES (when I was a kid and my dad worked from home, we wasted plenty of afternoons away playing <em>Hogan’s Alley</em>), most lived in the shadow of the iconic <em>Duck Hunt</em>, the most recognizable and popular Zapper game.
                        
</p><h4>Gone in a Flash</h4><p>
    
                            While older light guns like the Ray-O-Lite rifle emitted beams of light, the Zapper and many other recent light guns work by receiving light through a photodiode on or in the barrel and using that light to figure out where on the TV screen you're aiming.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            This target flashing method helped Nintendo overcome a weakness of older light gun games: cheaters racking up high scores by pointing the gun at a steady light source, like a lamp, and hitting the first target right out of the gate.

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?

	  <p>Introduction</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-Ireland.html"><img alt="Two surfers on the beach" title="Two surfers on the beach" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            This documentation presents the UNIX kernel I wrote
            in 1994-1995.  It's an almost complete implementation of the
            POSIX.1 standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988).  My main motivation
            was learning about operating systems design and
            architecture, kernel algorithms, resource allocation,
            process scheduling, memory management policies, etc.  The
            result is a new POSIX compliant UNIX kernel with many
            features real operating systems have: virtual memory, demand
            paging, protection, swapping, etc.  It is not perfect, it
            probably has bugs, but in time they will get fixed and the
            kernel will become more stable.  Since many high-quality
            free software packages are available on the Internet, coming
            especially from the GNU project, I have ported many of them
	    to my system, with the idea of getting real functionality.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  As of December 2007, Thix has been taken over by 
	  <a href="mailto:paulhulme@thix.eu">Paul Hulme</a>.  His work
       	  will be distributed through <a href="http://thix.eu/">thix.eu</a>.
          </p>

          <p>Status</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-Lebanon.html"><img alt="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" title="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            The Thix Operating System is fully functional at this time.
            Many free software packages have been succesfully
            compiled/run under it, including development tools such as
            the GNU C/C++ Compiler suite.  However, there is no
            networking support and the only drivers available are for
            floppy disks, (E)IDE hard disks, printers, virtual
            terminals, mem, kmem and null.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format of the executable is still a.out which is very
            hard to maintain due to its so many variants.  Maybe I'll
            switch to ELF one day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix has been developped under Linux with GCC.  Many thanks
            to all the people that made this possible.

          </p>
          <p>
            December 2006, i.e. 10 years later...  Yeah, it's been
            <em>that</em> long since I touched this stuff.  I could
            never get Thix to work in VMware, not straight out of the
            box anyway, but now that I got a Mac and <a href="http://parallels.com/" rel="external-parallels" title="Parallels">Parallels</a> seems to handle it quite
            well (minor keyboard issues notwithstanding), I figured I'd
            put an image out there for people to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created 3 images that can be useful for a number of
            things (development, study, or plain curiosity).  The first
            one is a <a href="http://vmware.com/" rel="external-vmware" title="VMware">VMware</a> image with an old distribution of
            S.u.S.E Linux (circa 1996).  This distribution has the old
            versions of GCC and binutils required to compile Thix.  I've
            set up two accounts, <em>root</em> and <em>tudor</em>, both
            using the account name as the password.  The <em>tudor</em>
            account contains the sources for the kernel and all the tools
            that have been ported to Thix.  I tried getting the same Linux
            version to install in Parallels under Mac OS X (Tiger) as well
            as convert the VMware image to Parallels once installed, and
	    failed miserably in both cases, so for now development is under
	    VMware and testing under Parallels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more exciting part though are the other two images, one
            which is a full installation of Thix complete with a rescue
            floppy disk.  These are raw images (the disk one corresponds
            to an IDE disk with C/H/S=163/16/63 geometry).  Unfortunately,
            I couldn't get Thix to work in VMware, so these images, as you
            can tell from the file extensions, are for Parallels.
          </p>

          </ul>
          <p>
            ... now back to the old stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix is distributed under the GNU Public Licence.  You can
            download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/thix-0.3.7.tar.gz"> Thix
            kernel sources</a> and the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz">sources of the fsck</a>
            utility, a great tool in repairing damaged Thix File
            Systems.  To get an idea of how Thix works, you can download
            the raw compressed image of a 3.5" bootable <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/demo/thix-demo.bin.gz">demo floppy</a>.
            Uncompress it with gunzip, dump it on a formatted 3.5"
            floppy and boot from it.  At the login prompt type
            <em>root</em> to enter as superuser or <em>guest</em> to log
            in as an ordinary user.  The <em>root</em> password is
            <em>root</em> and the <em>guest</em> password is
            <em>guest</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are curious and want to install the entire Thix
            distribution (including the GNU C compiler and the related
            utilities), just download the sources (you will need them
            anyway), and read the installation instructions in the
            INSTALL file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, you will have to download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/dist/thix-install.bin.gz"> install floppy</a>
            and the packages in the distribution:
          </p>

<p>One of the central challenges in data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) is
managing and maintaining data quality. As an ML engineer and  practitioner who
frequently constructs, cleans, explores, and models proprietary (i.e. non-benchmark)
datasets, "bad data" makes all the difference between accurate versus misleading
data visualizations, statistical inferences, and models. In this article I want
to hone in on three problems that are fairly unique to DS/ML practice when it comes to
dealing with tabular data in the Python ecosystem using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
which is one of the de facto tools for data manipulation in the DS/ML toolchain.</p>

<p>Tooling for type safety is improving in the Python ecosystem with the broad adoption
of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module and
projects like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>, which eases the developer
experience for writing readable, reliable code.</p>
<p>However, for most DS/ML work, this isn't quite sufficient. This is because
logical data types don't always capture the statistical distributions of the
variables under study, which is a key thing to do when, for example, your data
distribution shifts as a result of a world-wide pandemic,
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/">causing ML models to break</a>
in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Having systems in place that fail early (and loudly 🔊) when the data distribution
is not what you assumed is one of the critical pieces to building reliable
production systems, and we need better tooling for this.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Another important tool in the developer's arsenal is testing. There are many
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617296279">books</a>, <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests">articles</a>, and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5357601/whats-the-difference-between-unit-tests-and-integration-tests">discussions</a>
available online about different types of testing techniques and how to put them
into practice. I won't dive deeply into it here, but in short, testing your code
makes it easier to change it and know when you've broken something while at the same time serving as
documentation.</p>
<p>Even in exploratory or research contexts, it's a good idea to write tests for your
code because it strengthens your confidence in the robustness of the insights that
you're taking away from your analysis.</p>

<p>The challenge with testing software compounds when processing data for the
purpose of statistical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>Consider a machine learning pipeline that creates a predictive model from
survey responses. The barriers to testing data and transformation code
tends to be much higher than the business logic that processes survey responses
and stores raw values in a database because the latter tends to be simpler
and more atomic by design.</p>
<p>By <em>atomic</em> ⚛ I mean that each piece of data that's filled out by respondents
and stored in the database can be tested in isolation without having to
analyze the aggregate statistical patterns across a larger sample of responses.
On the other hand, for my statistical analysis to make sense, the overall
integrity of the statistical distribution 📊 of the responses needs to be taken
into account.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Because the effort that goes into exploring, cleaning, and figuring out how to
test my dataset is so high, I'm discouraged from writing tests for my pipeline
code. As the famous software development quip goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"legacy code is code without tests"</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael C. Feathers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But you might think: "but when I put my code in production, surely I
– or one of my collaborators – will write tests then?". The thing is,
regardless of who writes those tests or when they're written, someone'll have to
do it at some point, so the sooner and more quickly you can climb
the technical debt mountain 🏔 the better!</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I'll try to convince you that statistical typing gives
us the tools we need to do just that.</p>

<div>
<p>If you've used strong, statically-typed languages before, or the <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>
static type checker with type-hinting in Python, you may have noticed that type definitions can
often catch nasty type-related bugs 🐞 that render certain kinds of unit tests unnecessary. Other
tools, like <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>, enforce types at runtime via a
data parsing model.</p>

<p>Statistical typing extends the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">logical data types</a>
to the class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type">statistical data types</a>
and, ultimately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions">probability distributions</a>.
Statistical data types builds on top of logical data types, and in fact there's considerable overlap between the two.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>binary</em> logical data type is also a statistical data type. The key
difference is that statistical data types hold additional semantics that govern the kinds
of statistical operations that we can perform on variables of a particular type and
probability distributions that describe those variables.</p>

<p>What if you can specify the set of acceptable values that a variable can take,
from the data type, set/range of values, or even what distribution a particular
variable is drawn from? This is the goal of statistical typing: to enumerate a
practical set of constraints that specify what should be considered valid data for
a particular dataset.</p>
<p>For example, we might want a <em>categorical</em> variable to be drawn <em>somewhat</em> uniformly
from a set of values <code>{A, B, C}</code>. We can express this as a hypothesis test that
causes our pipeline to fail if any one of the values occurs significantly more
frequently than the others, given a pre-defined level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Or we may want a <em>real-valued</em> variable to be drawn roughly from a normal
distribution with mean <code>µ</code> and variance <code>σ</code>, which can also be specified with an
alpha value that we deem acceptable for a particular analysis.</p>
<p>In essence, a statistical typing implementation involves specifying three kinds
of metadata for a given set of variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>logical data types, e.g. <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>float</code>, etc.</li>
<li>deterministic properties, e.g. <code>categorical</code> values and <code>real-valued</code> ranges</li>
<li>probabilistic properties, e.g. sufficient statistics like <code>mean</code> and <code>standard deviation</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge presented by item <em>3</em> is obvious: discovering the underlying
probability distributions of real-world data is often non-trivial. However,
even if we can only express or automatically infer these metadata up to point
<em>2</em>, we can still get something quite powerful 💪: <strong>property-based testing of statistical
analysis code</strong>.</p>

<p>With a statistically-typed dataframe, not only can we validate real-world data to
ensure that our assumptions about them hold up, but we can also test our data
transformation, analysis, and modeling code <em>given valid samples</em> according to
our schema definition. Statistical typing effectively gives DS/ML practitioners
the tools to easily isolate their code from real-world data, providing a convenient
way of implementing unit tests.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Let me illustrate how these concepts would work in practice with a toy problem using
<a href="https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera">pandera</a>, a runtime data validation library
for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas dataframes</a> that I've been developing over
the last few years.</p>
<p>Suppose you're building a predictive model of house prices given features about
different houses:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the raw data above you can see that we have the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature 1: <code>square_footage</code></li>
<li>feature 2: <code>n_bedrooms</code></li>
<li>feature 3: <code>property_type</code></li>
<li>target: <code>price</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our modeling pipeline will involve two steps:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Defining-Schemas-with-pandera">Defining Schemas with <code>pandera</code><a href="#Defining-Schemas-with-pandera"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>At its core, <code>pandera</code> provides a flexible and expressive API for defining
dataframe schemas and seamlessly integrating data validation logic into your
data analysis pipelines, all while separating the concerns of data cleaning
and validation.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the code above, we can see that we're defining a <code>BaseSchema</code>, which shares
columns that are common between the raw and processed data. We're also making
sure that the columns are coerced to the expected data types during validation.</p>
<p><code>RawData</code> and <code>ProcessedData</code> inherit from <code>BaseSchema</code>, and just by looking
at them we can see the difference that we expect between the raw and processed data:
our <code>process_data</code> function should convert the <code>property_type</code> categorical
variable into a set of dummy variables.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Runtime-Data-Testing">Runtime Data Testing<a href="#Runtime-Data-Testing"> </a></h3><p>Now we use python's type-hinting syntax to annotate the <code>process_data</code> and
<code>train_model</code> functions, decorating them with <code>@pa.check_types</code> to make sure
that the inputs and outputs are validated at runtime:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now every time we run our pipeline our data is validated as it passes through
the various transformations:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we pass invalid data into <code>run_pipeline</code>, we should get an error:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, <code>pandera</code> tells exactly what went wrong: the <code>property_type</code>
column has an invalid category <code>unknown</code> at the 0th entry.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Property-based-Testing">Property-based Testing<a href="#Property-based-Testing"> </a></h3><p>But wait, there's more! Since we've already defined our schemas, we can isolate
the processing and model-training code from real-world data to test that
each component in your pipeline is functioning as expected.</p>
<p><code>pandera</code> builds on top of the <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>
package to generate synthetic data from search strategies that try to find
the simplest case that would falsify your tests:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We could run this as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
or <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> suite, but for now we can just run the
tests manually like so:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we were to incorrectly implement any of the components in our pipeline,
we'd see errors early on. In this case, we're just going to return the raw data
without the dummified <code>property_type</code> variable.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, our test suite catches the fact that <code>property_type_condo</code> doesn't exist
in our processed data output.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can get some more intuition about what's going on with the data synthesis
strategies by interactively generating data using the <code>example</code> method.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Under the hood, <code>pandera</code> is collecting all of the schema properties and
converting it into a search strategy using the
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html#pandas">pandas-supported hypothesis strategies</a>.
Currently, one limitation that you can see from the <code>ProcessedData</code> example above is that the
generated data doesn't quite capture the joint distribution between the <code>property_type_*</code> dummy
variables, as the second row contains <code>1</code>s for all of the property types. Depending on</p></div></div></div>

The foundation aimed to understand how automation and universal basic income may impact entrepreneurs, companies and the public sector.</p><p dir="ltr">Researchers recruited 900 individuals to take part in the experiment, 59% of whom were female and 98% of whom were university students. The average age was 21, with a minimum age of 19 and a maximum age of 30. Participants were asked to work on a set of tasks and were paid based on their performance. Researchers then introduced several different scenarios, such as replacing certain participants with robots and creating a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of the workersâ€™ median pay, to see how worker productivity was impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it was a laboratory experiment, Angel SÃ¡nchez, a co-author of the research and professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, said the researchers wanted to ensure their findings would be applicable in real-world situations, so the money given to participants had to be earned.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s not like I just give you money and then you donâ€™t feel you should care much about what to do with it,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œNo â€” you earned it and youâ€™re going to feel itâ€™s yours and you donâ€™t want to throw it away. And thatâ€™s key in the experiment because thatâ€™s what we think gives external validity to the experiment.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers also vetted their experiment with the FundaciÃ³n COTEC board of trustees, many of whom are part of Spainâ€™s largest companies, â€œand they think this experiment made perfect sense, of course as a stylization of real life,â€� SÃ¡nchez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though most of the experiment participants were university students, SÃ¡nchez said this, too, adds to the robustness of their methods â€” 40.9% of people under 25 in Spain are unemployed, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the highest youth unemployment rate for OECD companies.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo we thought that they would be, for this particular problem, a very good audience because this is something that touches upon what they are going through now,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œSo in that respect, Iâ€™m more confident.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">He added, though, that the results of the experiment are likely applicable outside Spain. Finland, for example, experimented in 2017 and 2018 with a universal basic income and <a href="https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing">found</a> that it improved individualsâ€™ mental and economic well-being, though the employment effects were small, which SÃ¡nchez said disproves the common argument that a universal basic income would cause fewer people to work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spanish government, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52707551">begun</a> its own nationwide experiment with a monthly basic income, providing approximately $500 to each adult in the program. Spain is prioritizing families, including single-parent households, and hopes to reach 1 million homes with the initiative.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, SÃ¡nchez said he hopes to see more research done on robots and automation, especially around how a tax on substituting a human with a robot might impact the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s probably something governments could try at least on a smaller scale for some sectors and see what happens,â€� he said. â€œBecause this is something that, outside of this experiment, I havenâ€™t seen.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Though a worker-replacement tax could help pay for a universal basic income, SÃ¡nchez and his colleagues also wrote in their research that an automation tax might impede technical change, which could pose long-term problems for society.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo other theoretical studies would be useful, too, in whatâ€™s the way to either prevent workers from being substituted by machines or to get money from the guys that are now using machines to compensate the workers that are laid off,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œThese two schemes need a lot of research. Thereâ€™s very little done there.â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The study â€œRobots, labor markets, and universal basic income,â€� published Dec. 16, 2020, in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, was authored by Antonio Cabrales, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; PenÃ©lope HernÃ¡ndez, Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia; and Angel SÃ¡nchez, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> It is a mystery often mentioned in the foundations of mathematics that our best and strongest mathematical theories seem to be linearly ordered and indeed well-ordered by consistency strength. Given any two of the familiar large cardinal hypotheses, for example, generally one of them proves the consistency of the other. Why should this be? The phenomenon is seen as significant for the philosophy of mathematics, perhaps pointing us toward the ultimately correct mathematical theories. And yet, we know as a purely formal matter that the hierarchy of consistency strength is not well-ordered. It is ill-founded, densely ordered, and nonlinear. The statements usually used to illustrate these features are often dismissed as unnatural or as Gödelian trickery. In this talk, I aim to overcome that criticism—as well as I am able to—by presenting a variety of natural hypotheses that reveal ill-foundedness in consistency strength, density in the hierarchy of consistency strength, and incomparability in consistency strength. </p>



<p>The talk should be generally accessible to university logic students, requiring little beyond familiarity with the incompleteness theorem and some elementary ideas from computability theory.</p>

    <p>I am worried about progressive perceptions of carbon pricing.</p>
<p>But first, a word from our sponsor.</p>
<p><em>“A carbon tax is the most straight-forward and efficient strategy for quickly
reducing greenhouse gas emissions”</em> - Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT)<label for="b1f4d654302ad3f9065ea4f63103ba604fdb4ad6f1809e4488b966a398d887e8"></label><span>This quote is from his <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-we-need-a-carbon-tax_b_5571408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 op-ed in the
HuffPost</a>.
Senator Sanders’ had previously proposed a bill that priced carbon emissions at
$20 a ton, and returned 60% of the income to Americans.
</span></p>
<p>Thank you Senator Sanders! Stay warm out there.</p>
<p>Like I said, I am worried about progressive perceptions of carbon pricing. It
used to be the policy issue that could get Bernie Sanders and <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26082018/john-mccain-climate-change-leadership-senate-cap-trade-bipartisan-lieberman-republican-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John
McCain</a>
rubbing ideological elbows, but no more, and not because conservatives left the
table. As carbon pricing has gained purchase with <a href="https://www.clcouncil.org/media/2017/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-Carbon-Dividends.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate
conservatives</a>,
it seems to have lost even more among progressives.</p>
<p>Some evidence for my concern:</p>
<h4 id="I"><a href="#I" title="I."></a>I.</h4><p>At the start of this essay, I quoted Bernie Sanders’ full throated support of a
carbon tax. That was 2014. Two years later, Senator Sanders hammered Hillary
Clinton in primary debates for her reticence to back a carbon tax. And then
after losing the nomination, he semi-successfully lobbied to give emissions
pricing a mention in the party platform. And then the 2020 Democratic primary
rolled around and…nothing? His campaign was completely silent on emissions
pricing. No mention of it in his <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/green-new-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14,000+ word climate
plan</a>.</p>
<h4 id="II"><a href="#II" title="II."></a>II.</h4><p>Whenever discussion around a Green New Deal gets into specifics, some of its
supporters seem to lightly chafe against emissions pricing, usually by omission
but sometimes outright.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HR
109</a> and
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/59/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SR 59</a>,
the pair of congressional resolutions which establish the spirit of the Green
New Deal, don’t mention any form of emissions pricing. Critiques of the language
of these resolutions have been met with the gentle reminder that they’re
resolutions, not specific plans. They’re meant to establish urgency and vision,
not get into details. And yet, into detail they get! Surely if “<em>‘smart’ power
grids”</em> and “<em>proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage, such
as land preservation and afforestation”</em> are not too granular to mention,
something as simple as a price on carbon might merit a bullet point?</p>
<p>This is especially true as carbon pricing schemes that direct their revenue
towards green investments or return them to Americans as checks fit very well
into the key insight of the Green New Deal: to focus not on obscure climate
policy, but on tangible markers of prosperity like jobs and growth.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Sunrise Movement gets a lot of press as a prominent, young
advocacy group who’ve basically staked their entire platform on the principles
laid out in HR 109. They don’t seem to prioritize carbon pricing much. For
example, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200317124840/https://scorecard.sunrisemovement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 Democratic primary
scorecard</a>
chiefly rated candidates on how their climate plan aligned with the tenets of a
Green New Deal. Out of the many specific policy dimensions candidates were
ranked against, no mention of emissions pricing<label for="61b6a510e04d569dd009f697e716ddae2825deb0dbaa0ca724e29aa589c6da5c"></label><span>Actually, they did have one dimension in the “How They Talk About It”
section: “Proposes solutions beyond taxes and regulation” which seems…kind of
anti-carbon-pricing? Warren and Sanders got 4/4, Biden got 2/4. Out of those
three, Biden is the only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly support carbon
pricing</a>.
Warren is “open to it” and Sanders is a no. The analysis on Biden’s score was
that his “plan relies heavily on market-mechanism solutions such as tax
incentives and regulations” while Senator Warren’s plans are “are not unduly
limited to reliance on traditional market mechanisms” and Senator Sanders’
“plans rely heavily on direct investment and direct intervention at the federal
level through a total of $16.3 trillion of federal funding.”
</span>.</p>
<h4 id="III"><a href="#III" title="III."></a>III.</h4><p>There’s fatigue from weak and byzantine carbon pricing schemes like
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cap-and-trade-is-supposed-to-solve-climate-change-but-oil-and-gas-company-emissions-are-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California’s cap-and-trade
system</a>.
And there’s a wariness among the progressive left towards anything market based
in general.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez captures this mix of fatigue and anti-market
sentiment pretty well,
<a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1094623850141224962?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeting</a>,</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For far too long, ideas
like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade were touted as the premier solutions to
climate change.</p><p>While those things could be *part* of a solution, the GND
resolution says they are inadequate as the whole answer.</p><p>The pipes in
Flint weren’t a “market failure.”</p></div>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1094623850141224962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February
10, 2019</a></blockquote> 


<p>It is a long road from Bernie Sanders’ centerpiece climate policy to “could be
part of a solution”. Bewilderingly, this fall from grace is set against a
backdrop of consistent support from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/climate/carbon-tax-united-nations-report-nordhaus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific and economic
communities</a>.</p>
<p>I think this is not good. In moving away from emissions pricing, we are
discarding one of our most valuable tools, not just for combating climate
change, but for building the political will needed for the fight.</p>
<p>In the following, I’ll make the case that emissions pricing—in the form of a
carbon dividend—is good policy, in a climate sense, in a progressive sense, and
in a political economy sense. This is true for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the <em>very</em> <em>least</em>, a carbon dividend can be thought of as a wealth
transfer from the fossil fuel industry and the wealthy to low and middle
income households, and one that also reduces emission by anywhere from a
little to a lot.</li>
<li>There is no better policy for getting people invested in climate change than
to compensate them directly for the damage fossil fuels are doing to their
world.</li>
</ol>
<p>We should establish common ground on what a modern plan for carbon pricing looks
like. The state of the art has moved well past cap-and-trade systems, and
real-world data from other countries is giving us a better idea of what works
and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Vast oceans of argument rise or fall on fairly technical policy choices, so we
want to be precise here. The more correct term is probably emissions pricing, as
what we’re talking about is raising the cost of emitting a whole host of
greenhouse gases<label for="e10a095059e8611aa37caae4ab96865b5846538baf7f378a7a68f962e3ebea5a"></label><span>For example, we want it to be very expensive to emit methane, which the
IPCC highlights as a critical target for reduction.
</span>, but because of carbon’s existence as a shorthand for many
pollutants, I’ll use emissions and carbon pricing interchangeably.</p>
<p>There are many policies that fall under emissions pricing. For example,
California has a cap and trade policy, which sets a cap on statewide emissions
and then lets companies trade permits that represent their slice of the
emissions pie. In a somewhat roundabout way, this effectively sets a price on
carbon. However, for a myriad of reasons, cap and trade is <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cap-and-trade-is-supposed-to-solve-climate-change-but-oil-and-gas-company-emissions-are-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really hard to get
right</a>,
especially with the ever present lobbying of Oil and Gas. Another common policy
is a carbon tax, though for reasons we’ll get to, it has some politically
pernicious effects. What I describe in the following paragraphs are the
fundamentals of a <em>carbon dividend</em>, a radically effective approach to emissions
pricing.</p>
<h4 id="I-1"><a href="#I-1" title="I."></a>I.</h4><p>First and foremost, emissions pricing is not a cure-all. But it sits at the
heart of pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Climate change is a many-headed hydra. We need<label for="b8d55523d6a79612bdd6b30e5246de1e8b8fd158451e5a633fea885620a0e88e"></label><span>Non-exhaustive list incoming, but loosely sourced from some of the top
solutions from <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project
Drawdown</a>.
</span> reliable, renewable energy at
a competitive price, we need to reduce emissions from agriculture, transit,
housing, and refrigeration, and at the same time, keep people fed, employed,
housed, and cool in ever-hotter summers. And while the suburban homeowner might
be the first to install solar panels and better insulation, she’ll fight you on
density and transit. And while France promises to decarbonize, her former
colonies, reliant on colonially-imposed, export-oriented monocultures, have
inherited colonialism’s plunderous economic model.</p>
<p>No, there is no silver bullet for this. But there is a common thread. It is
cheap to emit. But emission itself is not cheap—hurricanes and wildfires
supercharged by a changing climate are testament to that. This disparity
underlies virtually all the facets of the climate crisis. The suburbs can
sprawl, because it is cheap to drive everywhere and heat huge homes. We can have
our grass-fed<label for="6c3e273de5c1427c5f55beb6db4d797da0c0bd0aac7cf8729737d7d1392843ff"></label><span>Grass fed cows <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/08/13/746576239/is-grass-fed-beef-really-better-for-the-planet-heres-the-science#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20past%20studies,belches%20over%20their%20longer%20lifespans." target="_blank" rel="noopener">produce more methane over their lifetime than feedlot
cows</a>
since they take longer to grow to full size. However, the grasslands they graze
on sequester a lot of carbon. So if you’re creating or preserving grass for the
cows, grass-fed might actually emit less. But, if the grasses were already going
to be there, grass-fed seems worse. It’s not super clear.
</span> steaks and eat them too, because California wildfire victims
don’t get to collect on cow burps<label for="bd3632af708cb83cfe141b2b9463e4fd352d0bbd4c4770066310ec89011ec4e0"></label><span>They do, however, get to collect on Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, whose
equipment started the fire. Except, that’s really expensive, so PG&amp;E goes
bankrupt. And as part of that bankruptcy, they agree to pay the wildfire victims
with <em>shares of PG&amp;E</em>. On this topic, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-13/it-s-good-if-people-want-tesla-stock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg’s Matt
Levine</a>
writes, “In the ordinary course, the way U.S. bankruptcy and corporate law works
is that if a company owes people more money than it can pay, those people get to
own the company instead. Thus, if a company does bad enough things to enough
people, the remedy is that those people end up owning the company.” Except, not
starting wildfires as a power company in California is pretty hard, and so it’s
pretty likely that PG&amp;E, who is now actually just the victims of last year’s
wildfire, will get sued by the victims of <em>this year’s</em> wildfires. “The rule is
the rule: If you own a company and it does a lot of harm, you have to give the
company to the people it harmed, even if you only own the company because you’re
one of the people it previously harmed.”
</span>.</p>
<p>Like, the cost of a cross country flight<label for="ba63c800ab3882596ebe54fc3ff2c09bae2b9ca502730c7a32f0f111e918ce67"></label><span>New York to SF is about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/climate/airplane-pollution-global-warming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ton of CO2 per
person</a>.
The global average total footprint is around 5 tons.
</span> is partly a big plane and some jet
fuel and some complementary cranberry juice, but also a lot of it is the cost of
jet fuel emissions …</p></article></div></div>
