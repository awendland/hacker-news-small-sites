<p>Without leaving the letter <em>M</em>: <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#metcalfe-s-law"><strong>Metcalfe’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#mooers-law"><strong>Mooers’s Law</strong></a>. I’m not saying an adage should never, ever be named after a person. I’ll admit, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a> have a certain catchiness to them. But the trend of taking a maxim and calling it Person’s Law has resulted in dozens and dozens of these things being produced, and it makes my head spin. Soon every fact or aphorism will be Somebody’s Law. Not only have such adage laws become a cliché, but, as I have found when researching this article, many of the laws are either not named after the person who came up with the idea (ignorance), or are named by the author after themselves (egotism). They are also called “laws” when they aren’t really laws to lend the ideas more credence than they deserve, or at least more memetic value. It’s hard for me not to take on a negative tone in this article after being exposed to such egotism and ignorance. Apologies in advance.</p>
<p>Newton earned his laws. So did Asimov. But now any lazy aphorism can lend your name immortality if you push for it hard enough. Let me give it a go:</p>

Taylor’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If an adage is named after a person and called a law, there is a 50% chance the law is named after the wrong person, and if not, there is a 50% chance it was named by the author after themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell your friends. Ironically, I have basically stolen <strong>Stigler’s Law</strong> here (see <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#stigler-s-law">below</a>). Oh well, nothing is new under the sun.</p>
<p>Here are some popular adage laws. There are so many of them, but I bet you’ve heard of at least half. Special thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws">Wikipedia’s list of eponymous laws</a>.:</p>
<h3 id="amara-s-law"><a href="#amara-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: amara-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Amara’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>People overestimate the impact of a given technology initially, then underestimate it. Basically, when the hype bubble bursts, people are disappointed. After that, things return to a reasonable baseline. <em>Named after Roy Amara, the futurist who created the idea.</em></p>

Andy and Bill’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An increase in hardware computing power will be met with an increase in software demand. Very similar to <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#wirth-s-law">Wirth’s law</a>. <em>Named after Andy Grove, Intel’s former CEO, and Bill Gates, Microsoft’s former CEO. Based on an old joke that, “what Andy gives, Bill takes away.”</em></p>

Atwood’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All software that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript. <em>Created by Jeff Atwood, of the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a> blog. Named by himself after himself.</em></p>

Benford’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In real-world data sets, the leading digit is much more likely to be a ’1’ than any other digit: the chance is about 30% <em>Named after Frank Benford, who originally called it the Law of Anomalous Numbers, though it was mentioned first by Simon Newcomb decades prior.</em>. </p>

Benford’s Law of Controversy:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.” <em>Stated by Gregory Benford the sci-fi author, not to be confused with Frank Benford, the physicist and engineer who lends their name to the first Benford’s Law.</em> Because we have two “Benford’s laws”, maybe we should stick to Frank Benford’s original name for his law: the Law of Anomalous Numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="betteridge-s-law"><a href="#betteridge-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: betteridge-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Betteridge’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word “no”. (This really only makes sense for yes-or-no question headlines.) Studies have tried to disprove this law by showing that articles which have yes-or-no headlines are more likely to be answered in the body of the article “yes” than “no”, but these studies are clearly missing the point of the law. <em>Named after the tech journalist Ian Betteridge, who did not create the principle, though he claimed he did. Also referred to earlier as “Davis’ law”, with no reference to who Davis is.</em></p>

Brandolini’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than the energy needed to produce it. <em>Originally called the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle by Alberto Brandolini on Twitter, though the idea has been around since before Twitter was even a thing.</em></p>

Brooks’ Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” because it takes time for new members of a team to become productive, and because tasks are not infinitely divisible and adding people creates communication and collaboration overhead. <em>Created by Fred Brooks, author of the Mythical Man-Month, and named after himself.</em></p>

<h3 id="campbell-s-law"><a href="#campbell-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: campbell-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Campbell’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantitative social metrics often corrupt the process they are intended to measure because people will try to game the metric. <em>Created by the social scientist Donald T. Campbell. Although this law is often worded differently than <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#goodhart-s-law">Goodhart’s law</a>, as described by Campbell it is basically indistinguishable from Goodhart’s law, which was stated before Campbell’s law.</em></p>

Cheop’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is ever built on schedule or within budget. A patently false child of <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#hofstadter-s-law">Hofstadter’s law</a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law">Murphy’s law</a>. <em>This one is named after an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, but was created by Robert A.

Chesterton’s Fence:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t know why something is a certain way, leave it alone until you do. If you see a fence or other barrier across a road, some people will immediately try to remove it, but they may be ignorant of the reason for the fence and so could be making a mistake. <em>Named after Gilbert Keith Chesterton who stated it in one of his books. The allegory is clever and original, but the underlying idea is not and is essentially a restating of, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” or of the Precautionary principle, etc. It’s not technically an adage law, but I included it because I like it.</em></p>

Claasen’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Usefulness increases with the logarithm of technology. Combined with <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law">Moore’s law</a>, this gives technology a linear rate of improvement in terms of usefulness. <em>Named after the originator of the idea, Theo A.

<p>Ooh, three laws by one person</p>
<ol>
<li>When a famous, elderly scientist claims something is possible, they are almost certainly right. But when they claim something is impossible, they are almost certainly wrong.</li>
<li>The only way to know the limit of what’s possible is to cross that limit and find out what’s impossible.</li>
<li>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

    <section>
            <div>
        
<p>In early April, <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I wrote a long post covering all the science I could find about aerosols and droplets</a>. The basic summary was that this is an area of medicine with lots of misconceptions, poor assumptions, and incomplete science. There was good evidence that previous coronaviruses were spread by aerosols. There was good evidence that influenza is spread by aerosols. Overall, it seemed very likely that SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 was being spread by aerosols, but the science was pretty weak. There is still a lot we don’t know, but as I update the evidence 6 months later, it is pretty clear that aerosols play an important, and unfortunately still widely ignored, role in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dispelling some misconceptions</strong></h2>



<p>There are still many who argue strongly against the role of aerosols in transmission of COVID-19. In general, I think these arguments clash with science and have significant logical inconsistencies. Before getting to the evidence that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols, let’s dispel a few widely held misconceptions.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 has a low Ro</h3>



<p>One main argument against aerosol spread points to the Ro, with the assumption that airborne diseases will always spread easily, and therefore have a high Ro. The argument is often framed as, “this disease doesn’t look like measles, and therefore cannot possibly be airborne.” This is bad logic, as infectivity and mechanism of transmission are separate concepts. Some pathogens require higher numbers to reliably cause infections, which will result in a lower Ro no matter how the infection is transmitted. “While many airborne infections are highly contagious, this is not, strictly speaking, part of the definition.” (Tellier 2019)</p>



<p>The logic here is clearly faulty. The argument being used has the basic format: “X is a Y. Z is not like X. Therefore Z cannot be a Y.” This is somewhat like saying “a horse is a mammal, therefore that dog cannot be a mammal because they don’t look the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This logic is especially problematic in the context of aerosol spread because there are other diseases with good evidence of aerosol spread, such as influenza, that look nothing like measles, but a lot like COVID-19. In fact, the prototypical airborne pathogen is tuberculosis, and tuberculosis has an Ro between 1-3 (exactly like COVID-19). (Ma 2018)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the statement that ‘COVID looks nothing like measles’ is probably untrue. On average, disease transmission is low, but if you look at <a href="#superspreaders">super-spreaders</a>, COVID-19 starts to look a lot like measles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the arguments based on Ro are both illogical and inconsistent with science. If anything, the Ro of COVID-19 looks exactly like other known airborne diseases (such as tuberculosis), and so this would be an argument in favour of airborne spread.</p>



<h3>Most transmission is short distance</h3>



<p>The equally fallacious corollary to the Ro argument is that “if COVID-19 is transmitted through aerosols, we should see a lot of infections occurring over long distances”. Although it is true that aerosols will disperse much further than droplets, it is faulty logic to define the <em>mode</em> of transmission by the <em>distance</em> of transmission. The concentration of infectious particles falls dramatically with distance, even when those infectious particles are carried by aerosols. They are spread out through 3 dimensional space, and therefore decrease exponentially with distance. Although aerosols <em>can </em>transmit disease over long distances, they are much more likely to transmit disease over a short distance. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>This illogical step is so ingrained in the infectious diseases literature that most studies just assume droplet spread if there was close contact. This illogical assumption undermines a great deal of the existing infectious disease literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an interesting historical analogy, for decades it was thought that tuberculosis was transmitted through droplets and fomites, because it occurred most often after close contact. We now know that tuberculosis <em>can only be transmitted through aerosols. </em>(Jimenez 2020)</p>



<p>The existing science refutes the assumption that close contact suggests droplet spread. At the typical conversational distance of about 1 meter, exposure to aerosols is about 2000 times greater than exposure to droplets. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>The bottom line is that short range disease transmission is definitely consistent with aerosol transmission, and distance cannot be used to define mode of transmission. </p>

Transmission by both aerosols and droplets is highest when close to the patient. Although aerosol transmission can occur at a distance, the vast majority will occur at close range.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So why don’t we see a lot of long range transmission of COVID-19? The primary explanation is simple dilution. The further you are from a patient, the more dilute aerosols become. Risk of aerosol transmission drops off dramatically with increasing distance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of dilution of aerosols is evident in everyday life. You can smell cigarette smoke when you are standing 8 meters away from a smoker, but it is nothing like the obnoxious fumes present if you were standing right next to them. Similarly, cigarette smoke is much worse indoors than out. Imagine each smoke molecule as a virus. You are obviously at much higher risk 1 meter away than you are at 8 meters. (But that doesn’t make smoke a droplet.)</p>



<p>Dilution doesn’t prevent exposure to the virus, but it makes it less probable. With dilution of aerosols, the primary driver of infection is the intrinsic infectivity of the pathogen. If infection occurs after exposure to only a few viral particles, we should expect to see more long range transmission despite the dilution. If larger exposures are required, we will see fewer infections. This is the primary difference between measles and COVID-19.</p>



<p>One final note about long range transmission: we really don’t know how common it is in COVID-19. Identification of long range transmission is incredibly difficult unless there are a very small number of cases. With a small outbreak of measles cases, it is easier to determine exactly where individuals were, and identify airborne transmission. For the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, we do not know how the individual became ill, and so could easily be overlooking long range transmission (especially when the possibility of aerosol transmission is dismissed out of hand in some circles). In fact, there seems to be pretty good evidence of long range transmission in many of the <a href="#superspreader">super-spreader events discussed below</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Our current approach is working</h3>



<p>Another argument occasionally used to dismiss aerosols as a mode of transmission is that our current PPE approach seems to be working in hospitals. First, <a href="https://first10em.com/we-are-not-doing-enough-to-protect-healthcare-workers-from-covid-19/">I would point out that healthcare workers are contracting COVID-19 at a rate that is far higher than the general population</a>, so this argument is pretty weak. Furthermore, as will be explored further below, there are many other factors that significantly dilute aerosols in most hospitals, like excellent ventilation, good distancing, and masking of both patients and providers. Although not quite as good as N95s, well fitting surgical masks will still filter out as much as 80% of infectious aerosols. (Makison Booth 2013) Combined with the low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, these factors keep us relatively safe even when we stubbornly ignore the science that suggests aerosols are very important in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Particle size</h3>



<p>Many of the arguments against the aerosol spread of COVID-19 rely on incorrect assumptions about particle size. <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I went into this at length in the first post</a>, so won’t repeat myself here. The basic summary is that particles of sizes that many articles refer to as droplets actually remain airborne for prolonged periods, and are therefore better classified as aerosols for the purposes of transmission. Just be careful when reading articles, because many don’t define these terms. When I use the term aerosol here, I am referring to any droplet that remains suspended in the air for longer that a few seconds, whatever the size, because that is the feature that matters for infection control. </p>



<h3>The lack of definitive proof</h3>



<p>Some of the arguments against aerosol transmission simply assume droplet transmission and demand “definitive proof” for aerosol transmission. I won’t attempt a treatise on the philosophy of science here, but that is an unreasonable bar.</p>



<p>One version of this argument states that viable SARS-CoV-2 has never been isolated from the air, and therefore we cannot definitively prove airborne transmission. This demand is unreasonable. Measles and tuberculosis are both known to be airborne, and no one has been able to isolate viable pathogens for either from the air. (Jimenez 2020) Furthermore, this is probably an outdated argument, as multiple studies actually have identified viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air. (Lednicky 2020; Santarpia 2020a)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifics of whether or not viable virus has been cultured from air samples is irrelevant. The point is that unfair standards are being used when comparing aerosols and droplets. There is no definitive proof that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through large droplets. (Jimenez 2020) It is crazy to require such stringent proof of aerosol transmission, while simultaneously just assuming droplet transmission is occurring. The same standards must be required for both claims. We are unlikely to have ‘definitive proof’ of either claim. Our decisions must be made based on the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>There is good evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols</strong></h2>



<p>Although there is no “smoking gun”, the evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols is relatively strong. Below I outline the …</p></div></section></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		

		
		<div itemprop="articleBody">
			



<p>Jeff Bezos — a strong Democratic supporter — and Amazon are aiming to postpone a unionization vote at one of its warehouses in Alabama, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-to-postpone-alabama-unionization-vote-11611339250?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. Interestingly, Amazon has requested that the National Labor Relations Board reconsider allowing mail-in voting, claiming that the mail-in voting process has “serious and systemic flaws.”</p>
<p>Got that? Bezos and Amazon are doing all they can to prevent any shady activity when workers cast their ballots for unionization, and they are particularly concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>You are likely trying to figure out how that adds up, right? The <em>Washington Post</em>, owned by Bezos, called any claims of mail-in voter fraud by Donald Trump and his supporters dangerous and inexcusable. Amazon even banned Parler from its servers, in part to ensure no one could claim voter fraud occurred from mail-in ballots back in November.</p>
<p>But stop trying to make it make sense. It is not supposed to add up.</p>
<p>In this case, mail-in voting is disadvantageous for Bezos and his e-commerce behemoth. Therefore, they now consider mail-in voting seriously flawed.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/tech/amazon-nlrb-union-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells</a> CNN the company is seeking a “valid, fair and successful election” and suggests that only in-person voting can ensure that. Hmm, interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Amazon has, thus far, fended off unions in the United States. If a majority of ballots vote in favor of unionization, hourly Amazon workers would send an L right up to Bezos’ office.</p>
<p>Bamazonunion.com explains that a union at Amazon would “give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better.”</p>
<p>The NLRB says, “A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests.” Fearing an unfavorable outcome, however, Amazon now insists that current COVID outbreaks aren’t dangerous enough to warrant this NLRB decision.</p>
<p>Amazon says that Lisa Henderson, NLRB’s Acting Regional Director “reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an ‘outbreak.'” <em>O</em><em>nly</em> 218 people employees, 2.88%, at its Bessemer facility tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7, which Amazon does not consider an “outbreak” apparently. This is quite the change of perspective. Imagine the coverage from the <em>Washington Post</em> if similar questions had been asked before November.</p>
<p>Mail-in voting has never been about the health of Americans or ensuring that each voice counts. As always, our country’s most powerful figures in both Washington and Silicon Valley base their opinions solely on the outcomes that increase their own power, finances, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Hypocritical, but sadly, all too predictable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Data visualization is an important tool, and there’s been many cases where I’ve found myself wanting to visualize data from a CSV file. As I’ve <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/">been learning F#</a> in the New Year, I thought that plotting a chart would be a great exercise to help sharpen my F# skills. This is especially true as once I finish porting <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-08-writing-an-iracing-sdk-implementation-fsharp/">the iRacing SDK</a> to F#, the next step will be to record my lap times and visualize the telemetry data. Fortunately, charts can be created fairly easily in F# by using the <a href="https://github.com/fslaborg/XPlot">XPlot</a> library in conjunction with Plotly.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this exercise, I’ll be using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data_by_year.csv">Spotify Dataset</a> from Kaggle, specifically the data by year file. From this file, we’ll be looking to plot the danceability of music over time. According to the Kaggle definition, danceability is “The relative measurement of the track being danceable (ranging from 0 to 1)”, but I’m unsure what the exact criteria for danceability is (maybe tempo and loudness combined with some other variable?). The end result should produce an HTML file which you can then embed on a website:</p>


    
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        
    
    
        
        
    




<p>After creating a new F# console project in Visual Studio, the first step was to load the CSV file so that we can feed the data to XPlot. This can be done using the CSV type provider in the <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data/">F# Data library</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I created a new module called CSVRead inside a new file called CSVRead.fs. Inside the module, I place the first few lines of code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>FSharp</span><span>.</span><span>Data</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>filePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>Path</span><span>\</span><span>To</span><span>\</span><span>data_by_year.csv"""</span>

<span>type</span>  <span>rawCSV</span> <span>=</span> <span>CsvProvider</span><span>&lt;</span><span>filePath</span><span>,</span> <span>HasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, we bind our filepath to an identifier and then create a new type which contains the CSVProvider plus our filepath. We also include HasHeaders = true as our CSV file contains column headers.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that in F# we use [&lt;Literal&gt;] the same way we would const in C# or other languages. I’m using a literal here due to a blessing and curse of type providers in F#. On one hand, they’re amazing, because you get compile-time types for your data! But, that also means the data must be available at compile time. You can usually work around this by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including representative data inside your project’s git repo, so you can build the provider based on sample data and then parse any conforming input data</li>
  <li>Using a string literal in source code to define sample data and use that for the provider (which is what I’ve done here).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have our type provider setup, the next step is to create a function which loads our CSV file by using the GetSample() function from our type provider:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>loadCSVFile</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>try</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>cSVFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>GetSample</span><span>()</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>cSVFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>cSVFile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>cSVFile</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function’s signature is unit -&gt; Some cSVFile. Note that we’re using an option here since the CSV file may not load (for more information on using options for error handling, see <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-14-handling-errors-fsharp-with-option-types/">this post</a>).</p>



<p>Now that we have a way to load our CSV file in place, the next step is to use XPlot to chart our data with Plotly, a handy charting library with an HTML frontend. To do so, I created a new file called Graphing.fs which would contain our graphing module and associated functions.</p>

<p>With our Graphing module created, the first step was to create a graphData function which would map our chosen rows to a scatter plot. My solution ended up looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>graphData</span> <span>(</span><span>rawCSV</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Scatter</span><span>(</span>
       <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Year</span><span>],</span>
       <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Danceability</span><span>],</span>
        <span>mode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"lines+markers"</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function takes in our rawCSV type and returns a Scatter object, which is produced by iterating over the Year and Danceability rows of the CSV file.</p>

<p>One important thing to remember, is that in F#, the order of your files matter. In my Graphing module, I had been getting the error: <em>FS0039: The namespace or module ‘CSVRead’ is not defined</em> which confused me as I was referencing was my own module inside Graphing.fs. It turns out however, that I had forgotten to put CSVRead.fs above Graphing.fs inside Visual Studio, but once I did the error cleared up right away.</p>

<p>Although I’m not used to having the order of source files matter, it makes quite a lot of sense in terms of readability as the same principles apply to functions within the files. My experience with this style so far has made it easier to understand programs as I’m not constantly jumping from file to file and looking in different areas while trying to mentally keep track of function side effects.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a function which takes our scatter plot as input and then sets up the actual plot in Plotly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>createPlot</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>Scatter</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>data</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Plot</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithOptions</span>
        <span>(</span><span>Options</span><span>(</span><span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Music Danceability Over the Ages"</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithXTitle</span><span>(</span><span>"Year"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithYTitle</span><span>(</span><span>"Danceability"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithWidth</span> <span>700</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithHeight</span> <span>500</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Show</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The above code is fairy straightforward, setting up a pipeline which creates a chart to plot and then fills it with the relevant information. I must say that I’m becoming a big fan of F# pipe-forward operator as I find this style of coding to look clean and elegant while being easy to reason about.</p>



<p>With our CSV and graphing modules now in place, the final step was to chain our functions together in our Program.fs EntryPoint:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>CSVRead</span>
<span>open</span> <span>Graphing</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>argv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>loadCSVFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>graphData</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>createPlot</span> 
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
    <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we’re loading our CSV file and then chaining functions together to graph the data and create the plot. Note the use of Option.map here as loadCSVFile() is returning an option. In addition, we’re ignoring the return value since Plotly is being loaded and displayed in the browser and we don’t need any return value.</p>



<p>As you can see, plotting a chart from a CSV file is fairly straightforward in F#. I find F#’s pipe operator and lack of visual clutter makes it very succinct and easy to understand. Although this example creates a connect scatterplot, Plotly has a wide variety of chart types that you can create, and I highly recommend taking a look and playing around to see what you can do!</p>

										<h2>Master Japanese with Ease</h2>
										<p>
											Japanese, just like any other skill, takes practice to master.  Start your immersion experience in a fun and social way -- by creating real Japanese and sharing it with others, so you can encourage one another on your path to mastery!</p>
										<p>There are many ways to get exposed to Japanese via media, music, shows, and immersion, but relatively few ways to practice language generation in a way that makes sure you won't habituate to making the same mistakes over and over again.  We are changing this with our Visual Sentence Composer.  <a href="#signup">Sign up today to be notified when it's available for free!</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<li><p><strong>PROCESS</strong> Version numbers are now simply <code><span>X.Y</span></code> where the leading <code><span>1</span></code>
has been dropped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Dropped support for Python 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Removed the bundle support which was deprecated in
1.4. (#1806)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> File lists generated by <cite>pip show -f</cite> are now
rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
directory lower. (#1933)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
was accidentally lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
that ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
similarly to before.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> and
<code><span>pip</span> <span>wheel</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> command line flags have been deprecated and
the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
it’s internal HTTP cache which supplants the <code><span>--download-cache</span></code> the
existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--build</span></code> and <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--no-clean</span></code> are now
<em>NOT</em> deprecated.  This reverses the deprecation that occurred in v1.5.3.
(#906)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> Implicitly accessing URLs which point to an origin which is
not a secure origin, instead requiring an opt-in for each host using the new
<code><span>--trusted-host</span></code> flag (<code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--trusted-host</span> <span>example.com</span> <span>foo</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the new <code><span>--trusted-host</span></code> flag to also disable TLS verification for
a particular hostname.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <code><span>--user</span></code> flag to <code><span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code> and <code><span>pip</span> <span>list</span></code> to check the
user site directory only.</p></li>
<li><p>Silence byte compile errors when installation succeed. (#1873)</p></li>
<li><p>Added a virtualenv-specific configuration file. (#1364)</p></li>
<li><p>Added site-wide configuration files. (1978)</p></li>
<li><p>Added an automatic check to warn if there is an updated version of pip
available. (#2049)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>wsgiref</cite> and <cite>argparse</cite> (for &gt;py26) are now excluded from <cite>pip list</cite> and
<cite>pip freeze</cite>. (#1606, #1369)</p></li>
<li><p>Add <code><span>--client-cert</span></code> option for SSL client certificates. (#1424)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip show --files</cite> was broken for wheel installs. (#1635, #1484)</p></li>
<li><p>install_lib should take precedence when reading distutils config.
(#1642, #1641)</p></li>
<li><p>Send <cite>Accept-Encoding: identity</cite> when downloading files in an attempt to
convince some servers who double compress the downloaded file to stop doing
so. (#1688)</p></li>
<li><p>Stop breaking when given pip commands in uppercase (#1559, #1725)</p></li>
<li><p>pip no longer adds duplicate logging consumers, so it won’t create duplicate
output when being called multiple times. (#1618, #1723)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip wheel</cite> now returns an error code if any wheels fail to build. (#1769)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip wheel</cite> wasn’t building wheels for dependencies of editable requirements.
(#1775)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the use of <code><span>--no-use-wheel</span></code> within a requirements file. (#1859)</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt to locate system TLS certificates to use instead of the included
CA Bundle if possible. (#1680, #1866)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow use of Zip64 extension in Wheels and other zip files. (#1319, #1868)</p></li>

<li><p>Allow the use of OS standard user configuration files instead of ones simply
based around <code><span>$HOME</span></code>. (#2021)</p></li>
<li><p>When installing directly from wheel paths or urls, previous versions were not
uninstalled. (#1825, #804, #1838)</p></li>
<li><p>Detect the location of the <code><span>.egg-info</span></code> directory by looking for any file
located inside of it instead of relying on the record file listing a

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>DRM is the bridge between the Linux kernel and actual software running atop
Linux, for most operations which involve a graphics card. For example, X11 and
Wayland actually send drawing commands to the graphics card using DRM.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll be talking about how to write software which communicates with
the graphics card directly, completely bypassing X. Do mind that I am also
learning while I write, so some information might be inaccurate and also I’m
jumping through unnecessary hoops, from the perspective of just getting things
done.</p>
<p>I’ll be using C++.</p>

<p>The kernel DRM API is file based, which means you can open a file representing
the graphics card (usually <code>/dev/dri/card0</code>) and use that file to send actual
commands to the card, using the <code>ioctl()</code> syscall with the opened file
representing the card.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is also a library conveniently named <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm/">libdrm</a> that
simplifies all that. Keep in mind that all that it does is what we mentioned
above: opening a file and sending commands through <code>ioctl()</code> syscalls.</p>
<p>In C++ a simple program that interacts with the video card through DRM might
look like this at the top level:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cassert&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>// The file which represents the card
</span><span></span><span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>char</span> gpu_dev[] <span>=</span> <span>"/dev/dri/card0"</span>;

<span>int</span> <span>open_gpu</span>() {
  <span>return</span> open(gpu_dev, O_RDWR);
}

<span>int</span> <span>close_gpu</span>(<span>int</span> gpu) {
  <span>return</span> close(gpu);
}

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>(<span>int</span> arg_count, <span>char</span><span>**</span> arg_vector) {
  <span>const</span> <span>int</span> gpu <span>=</span> open_gpu();
  assert(gpu <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  <span>// some ioctl() magic here...
</span><span></span>
  assert(close_gpu(gpu) <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And as a sanity check we can try to run it in a Linux machine:</p>
<pre><code>❯ clang++ drm-part-1.cpp -o drm-part-1
❯ ./drm-part-1
❯
</code></pre>
<p>Surely enough, it runs! But it doesn’t do anything yet. It needs that <code>ioctl()</code>
magic, but at least no assertions failed and we know we can open the video card
file now!</p>
<p>Lets include another library which has some very handy <em>structs</em> and also
definitions of parameters for <code>ioctl()</code>: <code>libdrm/drm.h</code>. While we are at it,
lets also include <code>sys/ioctl.h</code> and <code>iostream</code> for syscalls and printing.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;libdrm/drm.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first interaction that we are going to have with the card is not going to be
with the card itself but just with the driver (bummer, I know). Lets try to
retrieve the driver version using a <code>ioctl()</code> call.</p>
<p>There is a definition for a <em>struct</em> which holds exactly this data in
<code>libdrm/drm.h</code>, <code>drm_version_t</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>drm_version</span> {
	<span>int</span> version_major;	  <span>/**&lt; Major version */</span>
	<span>int</span> version_minor;	  <span>/**&lt; Minor version */</span>
	<span>int</span> version_patchlevel;	  <span>/**&lt; Patch level */</span>
	__kernel_size_t name_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of name buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>name;	  <span>/**&lt; Name of driver */</span>
	__kernel_size_t date_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of date buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>date;	  <span>/**&lt; User-space buffer to hold date */</span>
	__kernel_size_t desc_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of desc buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>desc;	  <span>/**&lt; User-space buffer to hold desc */</span>
};
</code></pre></div><p>To get the version from the driver we need to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize a <code>drm_version_t</code>, notice there are some <em>char *</em> fields for which
we need to allocate memory.</li>
<li>Call <code>ioctl()</code> with the appropriate parameters and a pointer to our
<code>drm_version_t</code>.</li>
<li>Print out the information we get and free everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seems easy enough right? Lets do it!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">drm_version_t <span>create_version</span>() {
  drm_version_t version;

  version.name <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];
  version.date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];
  version.desc <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];

  <span>return</span> version;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>delete_version</span>(<span>const</span> drm_version_t <span>&amp;</span>version) {
  <span>delete</span> version.name;
  <span>delete</span> version.date;
  <span>delete</span> version.desc;
}
</code></pre></div><p>To print it out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>print_version</span>(<span>const</span> drm_version_t <span>&amp;</span>version) {
  std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version.name, version.name_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version.desc, version.desc_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_major <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_minor <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_patchlevel <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And finally, we can call all that in our <code>main()</code>, notice the <code>ioctl()</code> call
using the <code>DRM_IOCTL_VERSION</code> value, which is defined in <code>libdrm</code> so we don’t
have to worry about the specific values passed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>(<span>int</span> arg_count, <span>char</span><span>**</span> arg_vector) {
  <span>const</span> <span>int</span> gpu <span>=</span> open_gpu();
  assert(gpu <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  drm_version_t version <span>=</span> create_version();
  assert(ioctl(gpu, DRM_IOCTL_VERSION, <span>&amp;</span>version) <span>==</span> <span>0</span>);
  print_version(version);
  delete_version(version);

  assert(close_gpu(gpu) <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>After a little compiling, behold the power!</p>
<pre><code>❯ ./drm-part-1
i915
Intel Graphics
1.6.0
</code></pre>
<p>We are <em>talking</em> to the DRM driver of my Intel graphics card! No X11 involved,
this runs even directly in the <em>tty</em>!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <em>libdrm</em> does a lot more than just provide the definitions and
we do not need to be calling <code>ioctl()</code> directly, but for the purposes of
learning I found important know exactly how the syscalls are made to the
graphics driver.</p>

<h3 id="why-some-firecracker-automation-would-be-helpful">Why some Firecracker automation would be helpful</h3>
<p><a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">Firecracker</a> is a lightweight <em>VMM</em> (Virtual Machine Monitor), a VM
“controller” layered on top of KVM, created an open sourced by AWS. The virtual machine runs as a process in your
host OS, and is designed for simplicity and security. This post is not about Firecracker itself, but if you are
not familiar with it I recommend diving deeper.</p>
<p>Because of its simplicity, it only supports virtualizing Linux, and starting a VM requires handing to Firecracker a root
filesystem image and the kernel in uncompressed format. When using Firecracker you often times find yourself using the
sample Linux kernel and root filesystem images on Firecracker’s GitHub
“<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md">getting started</a>”, or building
your own.</p>
<p>Firecracker is started as a process per VM, typically listening on a file-based socket for HTTP requests to its API for
configuration and VM lifecycle operations. Passing all the required configuration becomes a bit tedious and is a great
candidate for scripting.</p>
<p>Besides, <strong>it would be ideal to run vanilla cloud images, as produced by the different distros, on Firecracker</strong>. This
is possible and was enabled when
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1246">initrd support was added</a>. Still, you need to download
the cloud image and modify it to potentially add SSH keys, change the default user’s password, configure the network,
etc.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, both <strong>configuring and starting Firecracker, and preparing the cloud images to connect and use
them, requires a fair amount of effort. The main goal of this post is to show some automation for these tasks, and offer
a simple way to run cloud images, as provided</strong>. Key to this automation will be the use of
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/">cloud-init</a>, a pervasive initialization software that is included in most cloud
images, allowing to configure the image on first boot, based on provided metadata.</p>
<h3 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h3>
<p>The created automation should be good to launch multiple VMs. Multiple Firecracker processes will be then needed (one
for each VM), and one socket file for each too (for Firecracker’s API to listen to our commands and launch the VMs). Then,
we will need one “disk” for each VM. A disk for a Firecracker VM is just a file on the host OS containing the root
filesystem. So it will suffice to download the cloud image, make some minor scripted adjustments to it (more on this
later) and then use it as a template –basically, copy the root filesystem to the file that the VM will effectively use.</p>
<p>What about networking? Firecracker allows you to specify a tap device to be passed to the VM. These tap devices will
then have one endpoint on the VM and another one on the host, allowing the network traffic to flow. In order for the host
OS to communicate with the VMs, and the VMs to communicate among each other, a Linux bridge will be used, where all the
host endpoints of the tap devices will be connected. The bridge will have its own IP on the same network (enabling host
processes to reach the network on the VMs), and then will be MASQUERADEd via <code>iptables</code> to allow the VMs to reach the
Internet.</p>
<p>Additionally, a second tap device will be added to the VMs. It will not be connected anywhere on the host or be given
any IP address on the host. This tap device will also have the special Firecracker property <code>allow_mmds_requests</code>, which
enables communications from the guest VM to the HTTP metadata endpoint to access Firecracker’s
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/mmds/mmds-user-guide.md">metadata service</a> (MMDS).
This metadata service is what will be used to provide the necessary information for the VM to configure itself on first
boot. The MMDS could have been enabled just on the main tap interface; but both for performance and security reasons,
it is better to have a separate tap device just to access MMDS.</p>
<p>This is how the complete architecture looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://ongres.com/img/blog/automation_firecracker-architecture.jpg" alt="Firecracker automation: architecture"></p>
<h3 id="cloud-init">cloud-init</h3>
<p>Key to all the process is <code>cloud-init</code>. It is installed by default on most cloud images, and runs on first boot,
configuring the VM. <code>cloud-init</code> supports several methods (“sources”) from where to feed the necessary metadata on how
to configure the instance. Here I will be using one called
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources/nocloud.html"><code>nocloud-net</code></a>, which is specific for
on-prem environments. It supports fetching all the metadata from an HTTP endpoint, which is a perfect match for
Firecracker’s MMDS service. It will suffice then to write the cloud-init necessary metadata from the host to
Firecracker’s MMDS service via its API, and the guest VM will connect to the URL provided as the seed for <code>nocloud-net</code>
cloud-init datasource, and fetch it. Configuring <code>nocloud-net</code> can be easily achieved by passing to Firecracker’s boot
source configuration the following additional Linux kernel command line argument:</p>
<pre><code>ds=nocloud-net;s=http://169.254.169.254/latest/
</code></pre><p>(see
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/firecracker/boot-source.json">conf/firecracker/boot-source.json</a>).
Here <code>169.254.169.254</code> is the address where by default the MMDS service is accessible from the guest (can be changed via
Firecracker’s API if desired) and <code>/latest</code> is part of cloud-init’s API when accessing metadata (more precisely, it’s
a versioning field).</p>
<p>But how do we connect to the metadata IP service? We should firstly configure the network, in particular the tap device
that would be configured for MMDS access. Fortunately, we can also pass a network configuration via a kernel command line
argument (<code>network-config</code>), from where it will be read by cloud-init. It must be a
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/network-config-format-v2.html#network-config-v2">Networking Config Version 2</a>
YAML file, base64 encoded (can also be gzip’ed before encoding –used here). The applied configuration will be
derived from the file
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/cloud-init/network_config.yaml">conf/cloud-init/network_config.yaml</a>.</p>
<p>Upon boot, cloud-init will then read the kernel command-line arguments explained, and will configure <code>eth0</code> inside the
VM, the device that is allowed to communicate with the MMDS API, with an IP able to access the MMDS range; and <code>eth1</code>
with an IP in the range of the internal network of the VMs. Remember that <code>eth0</code>’s host tap endpoint is not connected
anywhere, while <code>eth1</code>s host tap endpoint is connected to the bridge (and NAT-ed). Note that because of this, the IP
address of the <code>eth0</code> device can be made the same on all VMs.</p>
<p>Once the network is configured, it will follow the <code>nocloud-net</code> datasource configuration, and connect to the HTTP
endpoint, accesible from <code>eth0</code>. According to cloud-init, it will need to fetch two files from the metadata service:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/cloud-init/meta-data.yaml">meta-data</a>.
It serves to perform instance configuration. Here only will be used to set the instance id and configure the hostname.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/cloud-init/user-data.yaml">user-data</a>.
Probably known to many (as you can pass this on most cloud environments), is used to perform package installation, user
configuration and many other actions on instance’s first boot. Here, it is used as a
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html">cloud-config</a> script, one of the several possible
options to initialize the instance provided by cloud-init. In particular, it is used to create the <code>fc</code> user, add it to
password-less sudo, and set the SSH authorized key to an SSH pubkey, part of a key-pair previously generated on the host.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to this process, once the VM is booted, it will have its network configured and will be accessible from the host
(thanks to the IP assigned to the bridge) via password-less SSH and with sudo permissions. <strong>Just like your regular EC2
instace!</strong></p>
<h3 id="automation-steps">Automation steps</h3>
<p>All the automation has been written on a series of –a bit <em>hackish</em>– shell scripts. They are only intended for
demonstration purposes, and definitely have a lot of room for improvement. All the source code is
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/tree/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation">publicly available</a>.</p>
<p>To use the automation, please review first the <code>README.md</code> file and see if you want to modify any values in <code>variables</code>.
Note that this will only run on a bare metal Linux system or a Linux VM with support for nested KVM virtualization.
Follow the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Firecracker and set permissions for your user to access the <code>/dev/kvm</code> special device. See
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md">Getting Started with Firecracker</a>
for more information.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/kvm
[ $(stat -c "%G" /dev/kvm) = kvm ] &amp;&amp; sudo usermod -aG kvm ${USER}
</code></pre><ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/01-setup_host.sh">01-setup_host.sh</a>.
This script creates the host bridge where all VMs will be connected and creates the <code>iptables</code>
rules to NAT outgoing traffic from the VMs to Internet. Modify the <code>$EGRESS_IFACE</code> variable if the device would not be
correctly detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/02-gen_keypair.sh">02-gen_keypair.sh</a>.
Generates the SSH keypair. The private key will be kept on the host to SSH the VMs. The public
key will be inserted into the <code>authorized_keys</code> of the <code>fc</code> user in all VMs. Note that the more modern and
secure <a href="https://medium.com/risan/upgrade-your-ssh-key-to-ed25519-c6e8d60d3c54">EdDSA</a> keys have been used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/03-download_generate_image.sh">03-download_generate_image.sh</a>.
All the user configuration will be performed via cloud-init. However, because of how Firecracker works, cloud image as
downloaded cannot be used directly. First of all, Firecracker doesn’t use a disk image with partitions, but just the root filesystem.
Also, the kernel and initrd need to be provided separately (as Firecracker doesn’t support system emulation for
bootloaders). Finally, the kernel image cannot be compressed. This script just downloads a <code>.tar.xz</code>-ed cloud image,
copies it into an <code>ext4</code> filesystem backed by a file, downloads the initrd and kernel, and uncompresses the kernel.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/04-launch_vms.sh">04-launch_vms.sh</a>.
The main script, that launches N virtual machines. It launches one Firecracker process per VM, proceeds to configure the
VM and the metadata via Firecracker’s HTTP API, and finally boots into it. Note that several requests are needed to configure
all the …</p></li></ol></div></section></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>

    <p>Striking things about the figure below, which I got from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/time-use">Our World in Data</a>, on time use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People spend increasing time alone over their whole lives, with the exception of roughly their twenties. This surprises me a bit because it seems like people like spending time with other people, and I would expect them to increasingly succeed at it with experience and time to acquire partners and families and friends.</li>
  <li>From 31 to 45, people spend more time with children<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> on average than they spend with any other category of person, including for instance partners and colleagues.</li>
  <li>You might think all this children time would be substituting for some partner time, but as the children time swoops downward by three quarters, partner time stays about the same.</li>
  <li>People are at a relationship-time-steady-state between about thirty and sixty. I imagine that many people start relationships in that time, so does that mean that they also stop them at about the same rate, or gradually reduce time with their partners at a rate matching others’ forming of new relationships? Are people radically less likely to start relationships after about thirty?</li>
  <li>People spend broadly decreasing time with every group except their partner over time, from some early peak for each trend—in the teenage years for friends and family, and in the 20s and 30s for colleagues and children. I wonder how many people just like being alone and with their partners more than most other options, and steadily optimize for that, once they have been sociable enough to find a partner in their early years.</li>
  <li>Coworker time peaks at age 25-30 and goes slowly downward before the retirement descent. Is that from people dropping out of the workforce? Earning themselves a nice private office? Some difference between junior and senior roles?</li>
  <li>People spend fairly consistent time with their friends after a decline from 18 to 40. Retirement doesn’t increase it. Spending three hours a day fewer with children doesn’t increase it. I guess those things go to solitude.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If there is one thing that I have taken away from my 3 years studying CS at college, it’s that learning is not exclusively reserved for the lecture halls. In fact, I would argue that I have learned more by myself in my bedroom in the past 10 months than I have in the first 2 years of university.</p><p>There are several factors that went into this, but I want to focus on my experience doing research for both the computational brain lab and machine learning (ML) lab at my college. Before that, here’s a little background.</p><p>I breezed past the typical undergraduate CS courses and to be honest, I can’t say that I learned much more than I had for free online or that I could have in far less time for free online (do you see the pattern here?).</p><p>Learning what IEEE-754 floating point representation is was great and all, but something else caught my eye the winter of my sophomore year, ML. I started going through Andew Ng’s famous CS229 on coursera and was introduced to a whole new world with these interesting concepts. I quickly became obsessed. But at the same time, I stumbled upon the world of entrepreneurship and listened to countless founder stories of successful startups. My university classes became secondary to what I was teaching myself online and what I was consuming via podcasts and founder interviews on YouTube.</p><p>Now for those of you who are being swayed to skip out on university because of what I’ve said until now, please don’t take that as the main message. I am blessed to be able to attend a university and get this experience, and I will forever be grateful and remember these years of my life. What I do want to say though is that you will find much more fulfilment by proactively challenging yourself to find things which will satisfy your intellectual and/or creative desires beyond the lecture hall.</p><p>With my new found interest in ML, I scoured my university’s computer science website for things that an undergraduate student could do for more exposure to AI and ML. I came across the term research, which was obviously a term that I was familiar with but I did not know that the world of AI research was so vast, with its history going back as far as 1955. There were so many professors who were working on incredible things, so I hastily read a few of each of their publications and cold emailed close to 10 professors, each with a genuine interest in their work and desire to join their lab. 9 of them ghosted me, but 1 professor emailed me back saying that he wanted to meet the following day.</p><p>I had finally found an outlet where I could work on some more interesting things related to AI. Turns out, I had gotten far too ahead of myself. I was assigned to work on an interface for a robot head, which I happily worked on but quickly found to not be the kind of work I was looking for. Then covid-19 hit like a truck and all students and professors were sent home, and here we are now.</p><p>Covid didn’t stop my research group, and of course classes were still in session. I apologize for potentially sounding insensitive, but to be honest Covid brought a turning point in terms of research for me. I constantly started bugging a PhD student in my lab about what I could learn and work on during this time working remotely. After several back and forth emails, he offered a chance for me to work on an actual AI project to work towards a second author publication with him and one other lab mate.</p><p>Working on this publication quickly took all time away from me, and I loved it <i>at first</i>. The intellectual challenges that I faced in having to learn so many things on the fly fundamentally changed the way that I learn and I will forever be grateful that I learned how to learn during my time working on this project. Working with two other PhD students, we successfully submitted our project to a conference called CoRL and the work was accepted. Great! But I faced several realizations about the world of AI research, at least in academia.</p><p>I realized that research in AI was really cool and intellectually challenging, but I also realized that it took a very large amount of time away from both me and the PhD students in the lab. Deep down inside, I knew that I always wanted to start my own company, and I missed listening to and studying how other founders started their startups. I was passionate about building, but research had taken the time that I once spent listening to CEO interviews and podcasts away, not to mention time I once spent learning how to build software products. But the prestige and challenging nature of research and PhD students was compelling to me and it seemed like an easy route to respect from friends and family.</p><p>Amidst this internal conflict, I reached out to the ML lab at my college because it would be great to have another publication and potential recommendation letter for applying to PhD programs later on. I joined the ML lab November 2020 and worked on some very interesting things in probabilistic generative models and representation learning. The work that the lab was interested in was exactly what I had wanted to work on when I first fell in love with ML and AI. However, every day that went by reading a few papers a day, preparing for presentations on some of these papers, and going deeper still into the rabbit hole of ML research, my desire for making products and working on being an entrepreneur screamed louder and louder.</p><p>I took time to carefully reflect on what my desires were, and I found that all I desired was to live a life of continual learning and working on interesting problems. Research was a means by which I was gaining this for sure, but my opinion on research started to become exactly like what my opinion on classical lecture learning was; it was slow and I found that I could do things faster on my own. <i>Lightbulb</i> I realized that the bureaucracy of academic learning and research put ceilings over the potential that I believe I have. Only a month and a half later I contacted the&nbsp; professor of the ML lab that I wanted to work on my entrepreneurial dreams and that I could not commit to contributing to the lab any longer.</p><p>And here I am now, writing this blog to share my experiences with the people of the internet. Some of you may be wondering, do I regret giving up my chances of going to a prestigious PhD program and gaining the “elite” status of being an AI researcher at a top university lab? To be honest, I don’t have an answer for that explicitly, but I do know that the past month where I’ve been preparing to launch a startup with my cofounder and closest friend has been just as challenging and just as fulfilling, if not more, as my experience working with the computational brain lab and ML lab. The ceiling I once felt from university and research is nowhere to be seen, because the path to entrepreneurship is impossible to foresee. Everyone’s story of launching a successful startup is different, thus I live everyday in mystery just trying to get closer to my goal of working on challenging problems to help people live easier and happier lives. The path to being a researcher is quite established and oftentimes a rinse and repeat cycle. You do research in your undergraduate years and make strong relationships with your professors in hopes of getting strong recommendation letters for PhD programs, then you hopefully join a top 10 lab in the world and do research for 5-6 years before either doing a postdoc at a university or joining an industry lab. Then you work for the next few decades until you become a tenured professor at a nice university while still doing research and guiding younger researchers to push out publications for your lab. This sounds great for sure, but living in uncertainty sounds even greater to me. Even if I don’t gain a single ounce of respect or prestige that I could have from continuing to be a researcher, I will have no regrets because in the time that I live I know that I will be working on creating products and services to make the lives of people just like me easier. There is no ceiling to entrepreneurship. You control what your path is, and I’ve just started going along my path after taking a few detours.</p><p>I am by no means telling people to quit their dreams of pursuing research in AI, rather I am sharing the reason why I both joined and quit research in the field as an undergraduate student.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><b>TL; DR: Another year, another SBC!</b>
This time, it's a 4-core RK3328, with Gigabit Ethernet and USB3.
My fastest ARM-based computer yet!</p><p>

Let's install 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/">Armbian</a>
on it, and put it through performance tests.</p></div>

<h2>The hardware</h2>

<p>I received the Station M1 a few days ago - courtesy of
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stationpc.com/">Firefly</a>.</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://www.thanassis.space/stationm1.jpg" alt="Credit-card sized, inside a metal enclosure"></p><p>
<em>Credit-card sized, inside a metal enclosure</em>
</p></div>

<p><span color="red"><b>Inside:</b></span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RK3328</strong> Quad-core A53 64bit CPU, at 1.5GHz</li>
<li>2GB or 4GB of <strong>DDR3 RAM</strong>. My board is the 2GB model, costing 65$ at the time I am writing this.</li>
<li>8/16/32/64/128GB <strong>EMMC</strong> for storage; my board came with 16GB. Note: you can also use Micro-SD cards.</li>
<li>802.11 b/g/n <strong>Wifi</strong> (2.4GHz) + bluetooth 4.2. Antenna is included inside the enclosure.</li>
<li>26 pin <strong>GPIO</strong> header - assuming you open the enclosure.</li>
</ul>

<p><span color="red"><b>Front:</b></span></p>

<ul>
<li>One <strong>USB3</strong> and one USB2 type-A ports.</li>
<li><strong>Infrared receiver</strong> - the SBC also comes with a remote control</li>
<li><strong>Micro-SD</strong> card slot</li>
<li><strong>Power button</strong>; a sorely missed feature in many other SBCs <em>(forcing
people like me to do <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/remotepower.html" target="_blank">crazy</a> things)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span color="red"><b>Back:</b></span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USB-C</strong> for power (5V)</li>
<li>1x <strong>HDMI2.0</strong>, supporting up to 4K@60Hz</li>
<li>RJ45 10/100/1000 (i.e. <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong>)</li>
<li>3.5mm <strong>audio jack</strong></li>
<li>All this in <strong>credit-card size!</strong> See picture with 2 Euro coin for size comparison.</li>
</ul>

<p>The SBC came with a power adapter, so I plugged it in, connected a Full-HD 
monitor to the HDMI port, and...</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://www.thanassis.space/stationm1-welcome.jpg" alt="Default setup screen"></p><p>
<em>Default setup screen</em>
</p></div>

<p>After 5 minutes of configuration setup, I ended up with a fully operational
Android 10 set-top box experience; with the provided remote control allowing
easy control of the pre-installed Kodi.</p>

<p>But if you want to see an Android review of this SBC, you are on the wrong 
site :-)<br>
I have far more fun <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/android.html" target="_blank">hacking Android</a>
than I ever have using it.</p>

<p>So, to quote a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog">famous electronics Youtuber</a>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Don't turn it on! <strong>Take it apart!</strong>"</em></p>

<p>...and I'll add: <em>"...and then install a fully open-source OS, compiled from scratch"</em>.</p>

<p>Keep reading :-)</p>

<h2>Disassembly</h2>

<p>There are 4 screws holding the enclosure firmly in place. After removing them,
the insides of the SBC are easily accessible:</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://www.thanassis.space/stationm1-disassembly.jpg" alt="Disassembled"></p><p>
<em>Disassembled.</em>
</p></div>

<p>As you can see, the Wi-Fi antenna is already pre-installed; the two chips 
giving my SBC 2GB of RAM are easily identifiable; and on the top, the
GPIO pins that make SBCs what they are - perfect toys for makers :-)</p>

<p>In case you are wondering, yes, that's a battery slot for an RTC.
I always use NTP, of course - but this is a nice perk for usage scenarios
where the SBC is not connected to the web.</p>

<p>In the case of the Station M1, the 3 pins shown in the picture below
form a 3.3V serial port, that speaks at 1500000 baud - in classic 8-N-1.
Any USB2TTL dongle that works with 3.3V levels will do nicely:</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://www.thanassis.space/stationm1-serial.jpg" alt="Serial port"></p><p>
<em>Serial port</em>
</p></div>

<h2>The issue of SW - Armbian</h2>

<p>At a high level, there are basically two options with most ARM SBCs <em>(including this one)</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Either you trust the makers of the board with the custom
distributions they build (including Android ones).<br></li>
<li>Or you trust <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/">Armbian</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am firmly in the second camp. I don't know where the makers of the Station M1
stand on the subject, but as a rule, SBC builders rarely - if ever - update
their custom distros. I can't abide by that.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Using-Vagrant/">
I therefore prefer building the entire, flashable Armbian distribution for my targets myself - from source</a>.
There is no better way to trust my SBCs, than knowing that I built their OS myself;
and that I can go as deep as I want and debug everything using the source code...
From the deepest dungeon at kernel level, all the way to the top-level bash scripts. </p>

<p>Then again, I do this sort of thing <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/cv.pdf">for a living</a>. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>If you do decide to build from sources, the board is marked in the Armbian
<a href="https://github.com/armbian/build/blob/master/config/boards/station-m1.csc">repo</a>
as CSC - so you need to enable the CSC option during the build, and then
choose "Station M1". Other than that, everything just worked;
building went just as smoothly as any other flashable Armbian image I've compiled:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ git clone https</span><span>:</span><span>//github</span><span>.</span><span>com/armbian/build</span><span>/</span>
<span>$ cd build</span>
<span>$ sudo </span><span>.</span><span>/compile</span><span>.</span><span>sh</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>Since it takes some time to do this build, I performed it from an Ubuntu-Focal
Droplet that I created in my Digital Ocean account. At a cost of 3 cents per hour
and a total build time of approximately 3h, I paid 10 cents to have fully traceable
SW for my SBC.</p>

<p>Not bad :-)</p>

<p>Another option you have is to trust completely the Armbian developers - and simply
download the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/station-m1/">pre-built image</a>.</p>

<p>In either case, you then "flash" the image in any micro SD card.
In my case, I executed something like this:</p>

<pre><code># ls -l *img
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1816133632 Jan 20 20:06
    Armbian_21.02.0-trunk_Station-m1_bullseye_current_5.10.9.img

# dd if=Armbian_21.02.0-trunk_Station-m1_bullseye_current_5.10.9.img
    bs=1M oflag=sync iflag=fullblock status=progress of=/dev/sdc
</code></pre>

<p>When running this command, my Micro-SD card was inside a USB adapter plugged-in and visible under /dev/sdc.
Make sure you use the appropriate target here, <strong>otherwise you will wipe out your own machine's
data!</strong> The output of <code>dmesg</code> is your friend - look at it <em>(as well as the output
of <code>lsblk</code>)</em> to see the name of the device for your SD writer.</p>

<p>The <code>sync</code> output flag of <code>dd</code> caused a significant improvement in reliability with
my SD writer. You may or may not need this option - but if you don't use it,
make sure you actually invoke <code>sync</code> after <code>dd</code> is complete. And you will definitely
benefit from a big block size (<code>bs=1M</code>) and a nice and simple progress report
while the writing takes place (<code>status=progress</code>). </p>

<p>Most importantly: don't you dare remove the <code>fullblock</code> iflag. Trust me on
this - you need it.</p>

<h2>Booting Armbian</h2>

<p>After that, I plugged the Micro-SD card in the Station M1, and booted - in a 
normal, Armbian boot. I didn't use my USB-to-TTL adapter this time; the HDMI
cable offered a far easier way to interact with the boot process - and a
keyboard plugged in the USB2 port allowed me to easily work with the system.</p>

<p>I then connected the SBC directly to my router (over the Gigabit Ethernet
port), setup SSH, rebooted, and SSH-ed into the machine from my laptop.</p>

<p>Since I hate the speed and reliability aspects of Micro-SD cards, I then
proceeded to migrate into an external USB3 drive. I can probably migrate into
the EMMC, but I chose not to - I prefer to keep it in its pristine
("Android-y") state, for easy re-use when COVID allows me to visit people
again. A credit-card sized, portable set-top box is always nice :-)</p>

<p>To migrate to the external drive, I copied everything in the root fs into a
freshly formatted 5GB ext partition. The rest of the drive was formatted as
a LUKS-encrypted drive, which will take advantage of the crypto instructions
in this SBCs ARM cores.</p>

<p>I then modified two files in the SD-card filesystem to make the system boot
from the USB drive instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/boot/armbianEnv.txt</code> needs to know where the root fs lives:</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt>
<span>verbosity</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>
<span>bootlogo</span><span>=</span><span>false</span>
<span>overlay_prefix</span><span>=</span><span>rockchip</span>
<span>fdtfile</span><span>=</span><span>rockchip/rk</span><span>3328</span><span>-roc-pc</span><span>.</span><span>dtb</span>
<span>rootdev</span><span>=</span><span>UUID</span><span>=........</span><span>-</span><span>....</span><span>-</span><span>....</span><span>-</span><span>....</span><span>-</span><span>............</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>The device UUID is easily obtainable via <code>blkid -c /dev/null</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/etc/fstab</code> should also point to the proper root.
So the proper UUID needs to appear there:</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt>
<span>UUID</span><span>=...</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> ext4 defaults</span><span>...</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>That's it - the SBC now works from reliable, fast storage.</p>

<h2>How fast is it, with USB3 storage?</h2>

<p>Well, don't take my word for it - let's watch it in action:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386483" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386483.svg"></a>
</center>

<p>What you can see in this <em>asciinema</em> video:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This (110MB+ per second) is the same speed I have seen with this mechanical
external USB3 drive on any of my computers (including PCs). No slowdowns in
the Station M1.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you notice the temperature of 37C? This is my coolest SBC yet...
The metal enclosure and the thermal pad it uses to attach on the SoC perform
their work admirably.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Benchmarking CPU performance</h2>

<p>OK, but what if we stress the machine? Let's benchmark the device with my <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/renderer.html">renderer</a>.</p>

<pre><code># apt install libsdl1.2-dev
...
# wget -q -O - https://github.com/ttsiodras/renderer/archive/v2.3b.tar.gz \
    | tar zxvf -
# cd renderer-2.3b
# ./configure
# make -j4
...
# make bench
</code></pre>

<p>My renderer uses all available cores, and stresses the memory and the FPU a lot <a href="#renderer">[1]</a>.
You can see results from all kinds of machines running it via the <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/ttsiod-renderer#metrics">Phoronix</a>
test suite.</p>

<p>For completeness, I include the results from all my ARM SBCs - so you can compare
for yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Raspberry PI2</strong>: it reached 58C - and scored 17fps...</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>Average value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>17.306140</span>
<span>Std deviation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.199651</span>
<span>       Median</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>17.401600</span>
<span>          Min</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>17.064300</span>
<span>          Max</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>17.479500</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Orange PI Zero</strong>: It scored 21 frames per second and its temperature rose above 80C.
That forced me to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thanassis.space/thebeast.html#thebeast">install a fan to keep it cool</a>...</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>Average value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>21.027340</span>
<span>Std deviation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.037930</span>
<span>       Median</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>21.017200</span>
<span>          Min</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>20.979300</span>
<span>          Max</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>21.082800</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>ROCK PI S</strong> scored 28fps, with a temperature that reached 76C:</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>Average value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.139440</span>
<span>Std deviation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.084740</span>
<span>       Median</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.153200</span>
<span>          Min</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.003400</span>
<span>          Max</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.227900</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Station M1</strong>: Let's watch the newcomer live:</li>
</ul>

<center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386492" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386492.svg"></a>
</center>

<p>The Station M1 scored 32.7 fps. It never exceeded 1.3GHz while doing so,
  which makes me think there's more potential here - the Armbian defaults
  can probably be bumped up. Not that I need more horsepower <em>(it offers
  more than what I need)</em> but it's still nice to know there's room to grow.</p>

<p>Also, very importantly - notice that even though we stressed the machine to
  an extreme - all cores fully utilised <em>(see second run with <code>top</code> in the
  first <code>tmux</code> pane for confirmation)</em> the temperature <strong>never went above 53C</strong>.</p>

<p>The enclosure barely felt warm during the test; nothing even remotely concerning.
  From a thermal perspective, amongst all my ARM SBCs, this is the one I trust the most.</p>

<h2>Network</h2>

<p>Is it truly a Gigabit device?</p>

<p>Well, the best way to confirm it, is to use another <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/atomicpi.html">machine</a>
on the same Gigabit network, to send/receive data and benchmark via <code>iperf3</code>.</p>

<p>Again, let's see it done live:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386494" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386494.svg"></a>
</center>

<p>That looks like Gigabit to me :-)</p>

<h2>Power consumption</h2>

<p>OK - so we know this is a more than fast enough SBC, with fast USB3
storage and Gigabit networking. But how does it fare in terms of
power consumption?</p>

<p>I revert the configuration to a …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03160-0">new study</a> published Jan. 21 in Nature by Katrin Andreasson and Paras Minhas, suggests that cognitive aging is not irrevocable, but can be reversed by reprogramming glucose metabolism in myeloid cells.</p>

<p>Biologists have long hypothesized that reducing inflammation may slow down the aging process and delay the onset of age-associated diseases, such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and the frailty that concerns each of us during our aging.
Yet, the question of exactly what causes these inflammatory reactions of the immune system had not found a definitive answer.</p>

<p><strong>Diseases concerned</strong></p>

<p>A long-standing observation in epidemiological studies of aging populations has been that NSAIDs, which inhibit the production of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 and prostaglandin (PG), prevent the development of the disease. Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>Model ALS mice and patients with sporadic ALS have increased levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In addition, levels of microsomal proteins PGE synthase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, which catalyze PGE2 biosynthesis, are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27140190/">dramatically increased in the spinal cord mice model of ALS </a>.</p>

<p>Preclinical studies suggest that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an essential inflammatory mediator of brain damage via the activation of four G protein coupled receptors, namely EP1-EP4.</p>

<p>Transient inhibition of the EP2 receptor by antagonists permeable to the blood-brain barrier shows marked anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in several rodent models of epilepsy, without, however, having a noticeable effect on seizures per se.</p>

<p>In the brain, microglia lose the ability to remove misfolded proteins associated with neurodegeneration.</p>

<p><strong>Prostaglandin and myeloid cells</strong></p>

<p>Prostaglandins are one of the main mediators of inflammation which play an important role in improving neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Myeloid cells are the main source of PGE2, a hormone belonging to the prostaglandin family. Prostaglandins are a group of physiologically active lipid compounds derived from arachidonic acid.</p>

<p>Arachidonic acid is one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain (10% of its fatty acid content). Among other things, it helps protect the brain from oxidative stress by activating the gamma receptor activated by peroxisome proliferators.</p>

<p>One type of receiver for PGE2 is EP2. This receptor is found on immune cells and is particularly abundant on myeloid cells. It initiates inflammatory activity inside cells after receiving PGE2.</p>

<p><strong>Myeloid and macrophages</strong></p>

<p>Myeloid cells are distinguished from lymphocytes.
Monocytes, a type of myeloid cell, and their macrophages and dendritic cell descendants perform three main functions in the immune system. These are phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine production.</p>

<p>Macrophages engulf and digest cell debris, foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, and anything that does not have the type of proteins specific to healthy cells in the body on its surface.
The first author of the study, Paras Minhas, initially isolated monocytes from blood donated by healthy people under the age of 35 or over 65. Scientists also looked at macrophages from young mice compared to old mice.</p>

<p>During aging, functional changes are due to macrophages. Microglia residing in the brains of aged mice increase their soma volume but reduce the length of their processes, limiting their ability to interact and support neuron survival.</p>

<p>Macrophages can undergo "training" after re-exposure to a stimulus.
Recent studies have described that the induced immunity in young mice leads to an increase in myeloid lineage cells and can occur in myeloid precursors in the bone marrow.
As we age, a similar shift towards a myeloid cell line occurs, and the aging microenvironment may also have a ripple effect.</p>

<p><strong>Effects of a significant increase in PGE2 levels</strong></p>

<p>The authors observed that older macrophages from mice and humans not only produced significantly more PGE2 than in younger subjects, but also had a much higher number of EP2 on their surface. Andreasson and his colleagues also confirmed significant increases significant levels of PGE2 in the blood and brain of old mice.
The researchers found that in aging macrophages and microglia, PGE2 signaling through its EP2 receptor promotes the sequestration of glucose into glycogen, reducing glucose flow and mitochondrial respiration.</p>

<p>The dramatically increased PGE2-EP2 binding in elderly myeloid cells alters energy production in these myeloid cells by inducing them to store glucose, rather than fueling energy production in the cell.
Cells store glucose by converting this energy source into long chains of glucose called glycogen (the animal equivalent of starch).</p>

<p>This build-up creates a state of chronic exhaustion (stress) in the cells, which leads them to express inflammatory signals.
Not only have aging macrophage cells found it difficult to burn glucose, they also don't use other sources of energy for respiration. Young macrophage cells were better able to utilize lactate and pyruvate.</p>

<p><strong>An apparent rejuvenation?</strong></p>

<p>The authors deleted EP2 in transgenic mice, which halved the amounts of receptors. Macrophages from 20 month old EP2-deficient mice maintained normal cellular respiration and glycolysis. In control animals of the same age, macrophage function deteriorated with age.
Cells from control animals secreted pro-inflammatory factors, were poorly phagocytosed, and had fewer and poorly formed mitochondria. Macrophages deficient in EP2, on the other hand, had none of these problems, behaving like those of young mice.</p>

<p>Scientists gave mice one or both of two experimental drugs known to interfere with PGE2-EP2 binding in animals for a month. They also incubated cultured mouse and human macrophages with these substances. In doing so, the old myeloid cells metabolized glucose just like the young myeloid cells, reversing the inflammatory character of the old cells.</p>

<p>More strikingly, the drugs reversed the cognitive decline associated with the age of mice. Indeed, the old mice who received them performed recall and spatial navigation tests as well as the young adult mice. Blocking peripheral myeloid EP2 signaling is therefore sufficient to restore cognition in aged mice.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier EP2 inhibitor C52 improved glycogen synthesis, improved glycolytic response and TCA cycling of myeloid cells (microglia and peripheral macrophages), and improved cognitive performance.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, mice reaped these cognitive benefits even when treated with an EP2 inhibitor (PF-04418948) that does not cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>

<p><strong>Towards drugs?</strong></p>

<p>Since activation of the EP2 receptor has been identified as a common culprit in several neurological conditions associated with inflammation, such as stroke and neurodegenerative disease, selective small molecule antagonists targeting EP2 are being developed. to suppress PGE2-mediated neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Several companies manufacture selective EP2 antagonists, but none are approved for human use. Pfizer's PF-04418948 was tested for safety in a Phase 1 study in 2010, but the company has discontinued clinical development.</p>

<p>However, targeting EP2 could be complicated. The receptor is known to regulate blood flow and blood pressure, and has been shown to protect the brain during stroke.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="http://alexanderganderson.github.io/static/img/indeterminism.png" alt="two_times_three"></p>

<p>Two times three equals six or at least that’s what I naively expected.</p>

<p>It is well-known that floating point matrix multiplication can result in a variety of <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9911-determinism-in-deep-learning.pdf">surprises</a>.
But did you know that quantized neural networks are not deterministic as well?
A quantized neural network uses integers to
multiply weights and activations in a neural network.
Thus, the naive logic goes, two and three represented and multiplied as integers should always give the exact same result,
namely six.</p>

<p>However, according to the <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/neural-networks#validation">Android NNAPI Driver Validation</a> documentation, a
driver is valid if multiplication of quantized tensors is within plus or minus
one bit.</p>



<p>The non-determinism of quantized multiplication is a result of optimizing for
the most common neural network deployment use cases.  Neural networks used for
classification and detection generally work well with small amounts of
non-determinism due to the nature of the mathematical operations involved in
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1IDRdeCW">neural networks</a>. Furthermore, such networks often benefit from training with
some noise (e.g. batch normalization). Likewise, the input to many neural
networks comes from a camera that generates inherently variable images.</p>

<p>The main challenge associated with neural network deployment on the phone
is creating models that are sufficiently fast, power friendly, and small on
disk. Quantizing a neural network helps one improve in all of these categories.
Quantized weights take up less space on disk, take less energy to transfer, and
can be moved more quickly between different levels of memory.</p>

<p>The last issue at play is that it is much cheaper (both in terms of computing
cost and engineering effort) to quantize a pre-trained model than to train an
existing model from scratch. Consequently, the method developed in this
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877">Integer Inference</a> paper
targets quantizing existing models. The key idea is that a floating point
value can be approximated as a scale times a quantized value minus a zero
point. (Also take a look at the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/quantization_spec">Tensorflow Quantization Spec</a>).
The scale and zero point can be chosen relatively easily by, for
instance, looking at the
range of the weights and activations when evaluating the model on a number of
representative inputs.</p>

<p>The loss in predictive performance due to quantization in many practical use cases is
small and this abstraction is widely implemented and baked into hardware,
for instance, by Qualcomm’ <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>.
[Strictly speaking, the drivers for this hardware could be
changed to ensure determinism, but that may result in a significant loss in
speed at inference time.]
The SNPE was developed and subsequently, Android sought to simplify the process
of deploying neural networks given the wide variety of available
accelerators. The restrictions on the driver tests were relaxed after pushback from
chip manufacturers whose hardware and drivers did not produce deterministic
quantized math.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the NN API off by at most 1 (or 3 for a larger network) leaves a
lot of room for funny business that can change the results by small amounts.
The hardware and driver vendors want to produce fast times and low energy
usage numbers on
various neural network benchmarks and are less concerned about reproducibility.
This can lead to unexpected changes in neural network outputs.
For instance, the zero point or scale of the
weights might be changed for some reason by the hardware, and the quantized
values are then recomputed. Another thing that can happen is that the range might
be slightly shifted to make zero exactly representable (see Case 3: Inputs are
both negative and positive in the <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>).
Likewise, as the off by one error bound is on a per layer basis, larger
networks generate accumulating error. Practically speaking, the error bound is
increased to three for mobilenet in the NN API driver validation tests. Other
networks could produce larger errors.</p>



<p>The lack of determinism for quantized neural networks touches on the broader
issue of cross platform reproducibility and performance optimization for neural networks.
As the neural networks get deployed more and more widely, these issues will grow in importance.</p>

<p>The first major issue is that if you want to deploy a neural network across
many platforms, you don’t have any guarantees that you are going to get the
same results.
Even if you manage to assemble a large team to test your networks on many
different platforms, the problem isn’t solved.
<em>The lack of determinism means that even if you test your network
on every platform, a driver update may unexpectedly change your results</em>.
This creates an ongoing engineering cost beyond the initial fixed cost of
validating the deployment on existing hardware.</p>

<p>The next major issue is that some application areas have more stringent
standards in terms of reproducibility and auditability. Suppose that a neural
network is used in a self-driving car that gets in an accident. For auditing
purposes, it is important to be able to replay the decisions made by the car’s
control system exactly. In the best case, this requires a significant
engineering effort to keep track of all of the driver versions and internal
testing to verify reproducibility for any deployment.</p>

<p>The final issue is that while classification and detection are not particularly
sensitive to small changes in output, the lack of determinism makes it more
challenging to deploy neural network models which are deeper or more sensitive to
changes.  For instance, imagine a language model that is unrolled over many
iterations to parse or generate a sentence. In that case, accumulating errors
could cause unexpected results.</p>



<p>In the past couple years, there has been an explosion of experimentation in
neural network deployment from software frameworks to hardware
accelerators.  As the field matures, questions about best practices will slowly
be answered. The ability to <em>train once, deploy anywhere</em> will become easier
and easier. In the particular case of determinism, the most reasonable next
step is to have a driver test that ensures determinism and publish a list of
vendors that implement a deterministic API.</p>

<p>The question of determinism is only one small part of the puzzle of being able
to deploy anywhere. Another subtle but important issue is that different
operations will run faster on different hardware. Even if a network can deploy
anywhere in a reproducible manner, an even more fundamental issue is whether
or not a network will be fast and power efficient on any platform. Indeed, while there
has been a great amount of progress in the field of neural network
deployment, there is much to be done to make the ecosystem easier to use and
more mature.</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp could be fined up to €50 million over violations of the European Union's data protection rules, according to three people with direct knowledge of the procedure who spoke with POLITICO.</p>
<p>The preliminary penalty — the figure is now under consultation with the bloc's other data protection agencies — would be one of the largest-ever fines under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, a set of privacy rules that came into force in 2018. </p>
<p>As part of Ireland's draft findings, the internet messenger may face a fine of between €30 million and €50 million for not living up to transparency requirements under Europe's privacy regime. Whatsapp could also be required to change how it handles its users' data, as the case relates to how the messenger may have failed to properly inform its EU users about how it would share their data with Facebook.</p>

<p>France's privacy authority <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cnils-restricted-committee-imposes-financial-penalty-50-million-euros-against-google-llc" target="_blank">has fined</a> Google €50 million for separate privacy violations, while Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which has regulatory authority over Facebook, recently <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-data-regulator-fines-twitter-e450000/">issued</a> a €450,000 penalty against Twitter. That represented its first levy against any Silicon Valley company, many of which fall under Dublin's jurisdiction because these firms are legally domiciled in Ireland, mostly for tax reasons.</p>
<p>The multi-million euro draft WhatsApp fine is an initial proposal from Dublin, and has been opened up to other European data protection agencies for their feedback. A final decision on how big the fine should be — and what other remedies WhatsApp should agree to — is not expected until later in the year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner declined to comment. A spokesman for WhatsApp said the company was awaiting the final privacy decision.</p>
<p>In November, Facebook&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1521035">earmarked €77.5 million&nbsp;for a likely privacy fine against its messaging service WhatsApp,&nbsp;</a>which, unlike Instagram, is a separate legal entity in Ireland and therefore has its own set of financial records. The Irish data protection agency is conducting a separate investigation into whether WhatsApp can legally share its users' data with Facebook's other digital services, among other privacy-related concerns.</p>
<p>The draft penalty against WhatsApp, which Ireland <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1577539">submitted</a> to other EU agencies for review just before Christmas, comes as the messenger faces a global backlash over planned updates to its terms and conditions. Those include&nbsp;clarifying to its billions of users how their data is shared more widely with Facebook's other services.</p>
<p>Those changes will not affect WhatsApp European operations, but people across the bloc and elsewhere still have flocked to rivals like Signal because of privacy fears. On January 15, the messenger <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update" target="_blank">said</a> it was delaying the upcoming privacy changes, in part because of the confusion generated by the proposed overhaul.</p>

<p>Johannes Caspar, Hamburg's privacy regulator who filed objections to a previous Irish decision against Twitter, told POLITICO earlier this week that he<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1579886"> had not ruled out </a>doing the same in the WhatsApp case. </p>
<p>"WhatsApp has an enormous amount of users," he said. "It must be clear that the consent mechanism they use must be lawful and that consent is informed and freely given by the users."</p>

use – slightly fuzzy – and, interestingly, entirely passive: it never
needs to charge. Given that it’s meant to replace your paper, it
shouldn’t be too surprising that the tablet’s also incredibly thin.</p>
<h2 id="cornellnotes"><a href="#cornellnotes" aria-label="Anchor link for: cornellnotes">##
</a>
cornellNotes</h2>
<p>In one of my classes, I’m required to take Cornell notes. On what may
be a related note, it’s a terrible class. Regardless, I need to get an
A and so notes I shall take. The reMarkable comes with a built-in
Cornell notes template. It’s slightly different than the format I’m
used to, but it fits the bill well enough.</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the experience of using the device. I would
say that it feels shockingly natural. Using it to take notes feels
like writing on a clipboard with none of the usual annoyances – the
paper sliding, having finite pages; and all the benefits of a digital
device – sending files via email, OCR, a select-and-drag tool, etc.
It’s convenient, feels nice, and performs well. Most importantly, it
makes me <em>excited</em> to use it every time I turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="worksheet"><a href="#worksheet" aria-label="Anchor link for: worksheet">##
</a>
workSheet</h2>
<p>In another class, the instructor distributes worksheets every once in
a while to complete during class. Now that we’re in distance learning
due to COVID, these are <code>pdf</code>s – perfect for use with the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I download them onto my laptop, upload them through the app, and
voila. Look Mom, no scratch paper! I can write directly on the
worksheet. I’ve only started doing it this week, and it’s amazing.
Sure, there are programs on the computer that allow you to write
on a <code>pdf</code>, but doing math with a trackpad sounds like torture. With
the reMarkable, it’s enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s the device’s biggest impact. I used to hate writing by hand.
I would beg my teachers to let me type assignments so I didn’t have
to use a pencil – what am I, a caveman? Now, my paper has superpowers.</p>
<h2 id="notkindle"><a href="#notkindle" aria-label="Anchor link for: notkindle">##
</a>
notKindle</h2>
<p>It’s also a suprisingly good reading device, with native support for
<code>epub</code>s and <code>pdf</code>s. It doesn’t have a backlight, but to be fair
neither do actual books so I’m not too bothered. The default font size
is quite large, and the UI is really minimal which makes for peaceful,
undistracted reading. I own two Kindles already, but I’ve taken to
using the reMarkable instead for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no ads or tracking. On Kindle there’s an ad on the bottom
of the homescreen, which expands to the whole screen when you turn it
off – plus it sends every move you make to live forever with Big Papa
Bezos. Not so with the reMarkable.</li>
<li>The screen on the reMarkable is physically larger. Though sometimes
the compact size of my Kindle comes in handy, like when traveling,
having a nice big display is definitely an advantage. My Kindle is
closer to a large phone, and the reMarkable is definitely a tablet.</li>
<li>The reMarkable is a fairly open device. The Kindle, on the other
hand, is locked down and dripping with DRM (fairly easy to break but
still an encumberance).</li>
</ol>
<p>The developers have also made a browser extension for Chromium-based
browsers called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh">Read on reMarkable</a>, which I would love to see
the insides of but is unfortunately closed-source. Basically, it takes
any webpage, turns it into an <code>epub</code>, and sends it off to your device.
I love it and use it near constantly: whenever I run into anything on
HN that is either really long, or I just want to save for later, I
hit a button and it sends it to the tablet. Again, just incredibly
convenient.</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak"><a href="#jailbreak" aria-label="Anchor link for: jailbreak">##
</a>
jailBreak</h2>
<p>This section is titled “jailbreak,” which is actually a bit of
misnomer because the reMarkable runs Linux and you can <code>ssh</code> into it
with ease. It’s also not too fitting because I’m not just going to
talk about modifying the device, but also about official accessories.
My device came with a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/folios">Book Folio</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/markers">Marker</a> in the
box, which is pretty good value. I did find out while writing this
that they offer a “Marker Plus” that comes with a built-in eraser. It
is, unfortunately, out of stock currently but I plan on buying it once
it returns in “January 2021,” so supposedly sometime in the next week
or so.</p>
<p>Ok now time for the jailbreak-y stuff. There’s an active community on
Freenode, an unofficial <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">wiki</a>, and an <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable">Awesome list</a>.
All of these are really great resources for cool stuff you can do with
your device, and I’m planning to begin experimenting with them in the
coming weeks. My first goal is to get <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader">KOReader</a> running so I
can sync my extensive Calibre library to the device. I’m going to
avoid adding any <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable#games">games</a> so as not to add additional complexity
to a device that aims to remove distractions, and proceed slowly so I
don’t brick my fancy new toy. Stick around to see how that goes.</p>
<h2 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="Anchor link for: ps">##
</a>
pS</h2>
<p>The recently published fairly viral <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/index.html">Ditherpunk article</a>
by <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> gives a really interesting overview of image
dithering. After reading the article, I noticed that the reMarkable
itself uses dithering to “fade off” your writing and make it look
like pencil. Neat.</p>
<p>Also, comparing the reMarkable to the Kindle makes me want to
jailbreak that too – I’ll find some time to look into that soon.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>This was initially written for my regular column in the
Brown Computer Science departmental magazine, <span>conduit!</span>,
for the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/about/conduit/conduit_v12n2.pdf">Fall 2003
issue</a>. I think it’s far too much fun to leave hidden in such an obscure place.
The prose is unchanged since then (so some of the classification information
may well be incorrect); only the marginal notes are new.</span></p><p>The sender’s name was in all-upper-case, and the subject
line read, “Not exactly...”.</p><p>Spam.</p><p>But I’m glad I opened it anyway. “This is not exactly your
normal query...”, the message
body began. It was from an upstanding citizen at the NASA
Johnson Space Center, asking
for... the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for
DrScheme<span><span><span>Now <a href="https://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a>.</span></span></span>, a Scheme programming environment I
helped develop.</p><p>The what for what?!?</p><p>It transpires that a tasteful astronaut (name withheld to protect the innocent) had loaded
DrScheme on his laptop for use during his free
time in space.<span><span><span>Turns out he was working through <span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span>.</span></span></span>
He was (a) going to be on the International Space Station (ISS) and (b) launching a
hard drive image from Russia. The ISS is a multinational enterprise and Russia is, well, another
country, so the act of sending software in both instances involves an export. Both, consequently,
need an ECCN. (I wonder if there is some tacit assumption here that outer space, or at least the ISS,
is a foreign land. I wonder if there isn’t some
group squirreled away trying to determine the
equivalent of nautical limits in space.)</p><p>The US government does a remarkably good job
of publishing documents on the Web; anyone
who’s had to deal with the IRS or the lucky few
who’ve had to contend with the INS will grudgingly admit this. These are sometimes no more
than OCR-scanned copies, but the scanning yields
enough clarity that Google can find the documents. I can’t begin to imagine what this process
must have been like ten years ago. (Probably a lot
simpler: I’d have written off for an official document, then returned to my regularly scheduled
work.)</p><p>Anyway, accessing prose is not the same as understanding it. The second paragraph of the first document I read began “The CCL is contained in
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR.”</p><p>It was going to be that kind of day.</p><p>I have some layman’s thoughts about such prose.
It doesn’t look like natural language at all. I conjecture it’s because natural language is rife with
anaphoric references. Letting context and a rich
language of reference “do the talking” leads to
higher communication bandwidth, but it’s hell on
disjointed documents.... But this is beginning to
read like one of Eugene’s<span><span><span>That would be natural-language processing maestro
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Charniak">Eugene Charniak</a>, who had a regular column in <span>conduit!</span> that was
the inspiration for mine.</span></span></span> articles, so I should stop
this digression now.</p><p>The ECCN system is quite simple once you get
the hang of it. Numerous artifacts, from nuclear to
software, are given codes such as 14D993. These
codes determine the range of permitted distribution and the licensing demands on those who wish
to acquire them. Everything else is assigned the
default code EAR99, sometimes designated NLR
(No License Required). So it’s simply a matter of
reading enough documentation, slotting your
product, and finding a code. This is a bit like saying that feeding your pet octopus is simply a matter of pulling aside the arms, placing the food in
the middle, then retracting your limb. Easily done,
but you may lose an organ or two getting the hang
of it.</p><p>Reading these documents was not without its rewards. I discovered, for instance, that EAR 740.13
(d) (3) (ii) (A) differs from EAR 774 Supplement
No. 2 (2) (a), though they describe the same thing.
The former document is dated later, yet leaves out
a key provision included in the latter, the recognition that software may be sold electronically! Better still, I found that ECCN category 14D993
specifically restricts the export of “program”
proof and validation “software” using mathematical and analytical techniques and designed or
modified for “programs” having more than
500,000 “source code” instructions. Beware, all
you verification researchers—don’t get too ambitious!</p><p>Having done my research, I determined that we
fall under License Exception TSU (Technology
and Software — Unrestricted), though it all gets a
bit sketchy here because our software is not specifically sold. (The concept of free software
doesn’t seem to be in the ECCN vocabulary.
Cheap political crack omitted here.) This didn’t
necessarily mean we were EAR99, and EAR99 is
an ECCN, whereas TSU isn’t, and NASA had
asked for an ECCN. Mustering great courage, I
called the encouragingly named Outeach and Educational Services Division of the US Commerce
Department. After only a few minutes, I was connected to a gruff counselor.</p><p>“Can I help you?”</p><p>“Ah, yes, I was hoping to get a quick clarification
on an ECCN classification.”</p><p>(gruffer still) “Yes?”</p><p>(deep breath) “If I find that my product falls under
License Exception TSU under part 774 of the
EAR, can I assume it has the ECCN of EAR99?”</p><p>I believe I did this without inhaling.</p><p>These are the moments that test the mettle of great
men. Like Major Major’s father, my counselor
was made of stern stuff. He paused for just a moment, just long enough to
accord respect to someone he clearly perceived to be a fellow numbers-and-policy wonk. And then, in a voice rich in
cameraderie, he said, “You know, I’ve been trying
to determine that for five years myself!”</p><p>Being excepted from a license was not the same as
not requiring a license? In the logic of the US government, did the Law of the Excluded Middle not
apply? What was the difference between the two?</p><p>Syria.</p><p>No, seriously. The difference really is Syria. TSU
permits export to Syria, but EAR99 does not.</p><p>My counselor told me this with glee. Apparently I
had hit on one of his favorite trivia questions, because, now really warming to the topic, he informed me that he had asked this very question of
many of his colleagues. Some had incorrectly
identified the two; others, quicker on the draw,
had said that they were indeed different but had
recommended the use of ECCN 4D994. As everyone knows — shucks, by this point even I knew —
this was a contemptible response, because 4D994
permits the export of only specific software products. And so on.</p><p>Anyway, this story has a happy ending. We appear
to meet EAR99. NASA Johnson has acknowledged receipt of our ECCN. I’ve been in touch
with the fine astronaut. DrScheme will soon be
happily beta-v-cs-reducing expressions in outer
space.</p><p>Where has your programming language been today?</p></div></div></div>]]>

        </p>

  <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Terraform is great; I provide a Terraform recipe that’s easy to get started with, along with some things I learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2>
<p>Software developers who are interested in trying out Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Until recently, my old web property languished on a past end-of-life Rails Heroku stack. It was slow to build and served over plain HTTP. Time for an upgrade.</p>

<p>I taught myself Terraform (and Jekyll) by migrating to this new stack. I’m convinced it’s an ideal configuration for modern static sites: S3-backed CloudFront offers blazing fast page loads, SSL/TLS configuration is one-and-done, and your cloud architecture is expressed in code, so you never need click through tedious AWS interfaces trying to remember how you configured a firewall setting or bucket rule. And you have complete control over every part of your stack.</p>

<p>I’ve captured my learnings in two public repos: <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/jekyll_pkcom">jekyll-pkcom</a></p>

<p>Feel free to start there. The rest of this post will cover some more detailed thoughts and observations on working with Terraform. Code snippets reference <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="terraforms-tactical-merits">Terraform’s tactical merits</h2>
<p>Terraform expresses cloud infrastructure (i.e. servers, load balancers, datastores, permissions) in code. This is super great because non-trivial cloud configurations become complex very quickly.</p>

<p>Cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure) provide browser UIs out of the box for managing infrastructure. These can be helpful when starting out, but quickly become cumbersome.</p>

<p>Here are a few scenarios that illustrate problems I have encountered with cloud infrastructure management before Terraform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A teammate changes a firewall rule, cutting communication between a load balancer and a server. Identifying the root cause takes minutes rather than seconds, because infrastructure configurations are not versioned in a central place. After identifying the bad firewall rule, uncertainty lingers - have other misconfigurations occurred which may also be impacting production?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You want to set up a new CDN distribution that reads from various S3 buckets. To do this, you need to copy and paste a list of S3 bucket names into an AWS web form to tell the new CDN distribution where to read from.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Terraform solves issues like these by deploying your cloud infrastucture from a versioned template files. Terraform deployments are idempotent, so existing architecture is preserved if it reflects what’s in your Terraform specification.</p>

<h2 id="notes-and-learnings">Notes and learnings</h2>

<p>The official Terraform <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html">documentation</a> is indispensable and generally quite good, but it can be overwhelming when starting out.</p>

<p>I found it helpful to start with a minimal working Terraform configuration (say, a single <code>.tf</code> file that deploys a bare EC2 instance), and extend iteratively.</p>

<p>Let’s look at <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a>: it has a single Terraform directory, <code>s3</code>, with just 3 files inside. Yep, that’s all you need. Like Git, Terraform only cares about the directory you tell it to care about. If you run <code>cd s3 &amp;&amp; terraform init .</code>, Terraform will start managing artifacts within <code>s3/</code>, and only <code>s3/</code>. Terraform can manage multiple directories through Terraform modules, but those are out of the scope of this minimal example.</p>

<p><code>s3.tf</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraform {
	...
} 
provider "aws" {
	...
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "pkcom" {
	...
}

resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "pkcomCFDistro"{
	...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s some boilerplate, specifying AWS as our cloud provider, then just two resources: an S3 bucket and a CloudFront distribution. Sadly, Terraform <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/571">does not currently support</a> dynamic names, so you’ll have to change “pkcom” and “pkcomCFDistro” to something relevant to you.</p>

<p>That’s it: get used to resource blocks; they’re Terraform’s bread and butter. Resources are tied to a specific cloud provider, so if you’re not using AWS, you’ll need to use Azure resource blocks, for example, which will have configuration options that differ from AWS.</p>

<p>You could populate <code>s3.tf</code> with hard-coded variables, like S3 bucket names, but it’s best to think of your main <code>.tf</code> file as a template, and store variables separately. Let’s check out <code>variables.tf</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>variable "region" {
  default = "us-west-2"
}

variable "property" {
}

variable "bucketName" {
}
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how you declare variables in Terraform. I’ve abstracted the <em>values</em> of the variables into <code>terraform.tfvars</code>. This is a way to keep secret values out of version control, but it’s not required.</p>

<p>When you run <code>terraform apply</code>, the Terraform CLI will automatically inject variables into your template file(s).</p>

<p>That’s it! Once you’ve populated <code>terraform.tfvars</code> with your specific values, you can deploy with <code>terraform apply</code>.</p>

<h3 id="http-or-https">http or https?</h3>

<p>It’s easy to misconfigure the connection between S3 and and CloudFront. After trial and error I found that it’s best to have CloudFront fetch S3 objects over http, but accept only https requests:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>origin_protocol_policy = "http-only"
...
viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some recipes will specify</p>

<div><div><pre><code>origin_protocol_policy = "match-viewer"`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which causes CloudFront to raise HTTP 504 errors in my experience. In general, it’s handy to enable an S3 logging bucket when debugging S3 &lt;-&gt; CloudFront issues.</p>

<h3 id="custom-domain--cert">custom domain / cert</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a> is configured to use a custom domain, so your web property can be accessed via a normal domain instead of xyz.cloudfront.net. Doing this in AWS requires a custom SSL/TLS cert. You need out-of-band approval for a cert. Log into the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm">AWS Certificate Manager</a> to create one, then add its ARN in <code>terraform.tvars</code>. If you prefer to host domains outside of AWS’s Route53 service like I do, you’ll also need to follow <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html">this CNAMEing procedure</a>. Verifying ownership of your domain is easy, but manual and out-of-band. It took about 10 minutes for AWS to recognize ownership for my domain after I updated CNAME records through my 3rd party DNS service.</p>

<h3 id="503-gotcha">503 gotcha</h3>
<p>If you’re getting 503’s from CloudFront, it may be because you need a <code>custom_origin_config</code> within your <code>aws_cloudfront_distribution</code> resource block. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a>’s configuration should work out of the box.</p>

<p>And if you have any feedback or suggestions, please add an issue or open a PR on the <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">Github repo!</a></p>

<p>* Terraform supports most cloud providers; this post uses AWS.</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/viral-evolution | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/viral-evolution">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c850fbf271b4b442b8bf"><div><p>This week, we stumbled across&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/TEb33U0hHxM" target="_blank">a video</a>&nbsp;that outlines a paradigm shift in the way that humans see viruses in the context of germ theory. The traditional explanation of disease is that it’s caused by microbial colonization of a healthy body. The immune system, then, is there to mount a defense against that pathogen. Since their discovery in the early 20th century, viruses have been included in this milieu as just another type of autonomous pathogen.</p><p>More recently, however, both the human microbiome and the human virome have been recognized as foundational elements of our biology. The “-ome” title is given in order to denote a network of interrelated viruses or microorganisms that are associated with the human body. In the case of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919837/" target="_blank">virome</a>, this includes the viruses that target members of the gut microbiota (our intestinal bacteria). Viruses, however, unlike bacteria, archaea, and fungi are not organisms - rather,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26970895/" target="_blank">they are a process</a>. During the viral process, target-specific, nucleotide-containing vesicles, virions, are secreted by one individual and can be taken up by another.&nbsp;</p><p>The paradigm shift, that the viral program represents a wider communication network between organisms, has seen some press - but like all such shifts, is slow to be accepted. There are even tantalizing clues that viruses may have an evolutionary role that extends beyond mere pathology.&nbsp;</p><p>In this video, Dr. Zach Bush points to this changing pathogenic narrative with enthusiastic certainty... and then adds some other less established assertions. The conversation that follows takes aim at some of these tendentious assertions. More importantly, we demystify Dr. Bush’s presentation, showing both the merits of his theory as well as his use of some rather common epistemological vices.  Let us know your thoughts on social or in the comment section…</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599965975832_14859"><div><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>We don’t really make it to the core of the presentation of the video until the very end - that the pathology of COVID-19 is due to the fact that humans live in a particularly toxic environment. This is maybe the strongest piece of his whole argument since there’s ample literature that suggests air pollution plays an important role in the lethality of COVID - as do pre-occurring conditions. [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972032221X" target="_blank">1</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345938/" target="_blank">2</a>][<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/27/2020.04.05.20054502.full.pdf" target="_blank">3</a>]</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it seems like Dr. Bush is setting out to explain how COVID or pandemics in general are a natural response to a toxic environment. He sees viruses as a whole-species software update. If you get the update, your body will adapt. If you are unable to handle the update, your body self-destructs through widespread inflammatory disease. He presents this “update” notion as a matter of fact, but it’s quite hypothetical since we aren’t aware of any selective advantage of getting infected. It is an interesting theory but his conversion of hypothesis to fact sets off alarms.</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>This sort of certainty is a common feature of scientific presentations - both fringe and mainstream, that leave me uneasy about the reliability of the presenter’s claims. For me, it shifts their presentation into one of belief. Ideally, when someone makes a presentation they’re doing so from the standpoint of possibility, rather than certainty, since the entire enterprise of science is one of “maybe.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;For me, the most valuable scholars are the ones that will not make a claim without scaling the uncertainty, either qualitatively or quantitatively.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>And we see some of those issues here pretty early. He makes the claim that 50% of the human genome is viral, which is, at best, a 5X exaggeration. Then there are some non-specific claims about the fact that viral expression is induced by stress, which has only been shown in the case of herpes simplex, not across the board. Then there’s the nebulous presentation about these pools of pig feces where there’s a lot of “stress” that causes the viruses to jump into the human population.&nbsp;</p><p>None of them would be deal-breakers if presented in an inductive lens. Say, “We know that stress causes flare-ups of the herpes virus, so..” or “a significant amount of the human genome is composed of viral DNA…” It makes it much harder for me to pay attention to the actual content of the presentation since I’m so busy searching PubMed for confirmation of the claims.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;Right. And I feel like these are very common problems amongst both science popularizers and scientists themselves. They want so badly for their theory to be taken seriously that they’re willing to compromise their presentation’s accuracy. We see this all the time from institutional authorities as well.&nbsp;</p><p>But underneath all the exaggerations and hypotheses converted to “facts,” we have a cool idea; one that’s rapidly gaining mainstream traction. Scientists are starting to realize that viruses aren’t jumping or doing anything active like an organism: they’re a targeted message system. Recall that a virus itself is a process; the physical objects secreted are called “virions” and they are not alive in the canonical sense.</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>The question of viral “aliveness” has come up over and over again in our research on COVID and viruses, in general, these last few months. In order to be a living organism, you’d expect viruses to reproduce independently - but no, they can only do so by forcing a host cell to create them - lending credence to the idea that they’re little more than software.</p><p>That’s probably the biggest gem in this presentation - that viruses are a software program. But I’m not totally sure about the fact that they’re more damaging in the modern-day because we live in some kind of “toxic” world. After all, virions make up the majority of the nucleic acid content in the world. That there weren’t always some that could cause harm to humans just doesn’t scan for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;I’m fairly sure that our industrial world is pumping out toxins on a level that our ancestors never imagined in their worst nightmares, but the link to viral expression or infection-mediated resilience, while interesting, is far from a settled matter. And this is why it’s so important to be transparent when presenting a new idea in science. If you want your idea to be taken seriously, you can’t oversell its merits. At best you can oversell its&nbsp;<em>potential&nbsp;</em>merits.</p><p>When you present a new mechanism in science, also called a theory, you have to be absolutely clear in the set up: here is what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;known and apparent, and here is what could hypothetically, if shown to be true, provide for my explanation.</p><p>Honestly, if a presenter does not follow that simple method, it makes a lot of work for readers like us, trying to pluck the gold from the slag. And quite frankly, most scientists won’t have the patience for this at some point, which means that a lot of potentially brilliant leaps get relegated to the back pages.</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>It’s definitely not as sexy, to talk about possibility rather than certainty, or to avoid tendentious claims - those are basically the fritos of the intellectual world. But I think that there’s a lot to be said about the ideas that are produced by the “fringe” actually being useful for all of science. They’re analogous to the potentially pathological software updates that Dr. Bush suggests viruses act like!</p><p>I’d love to see a wider acceptance among audience members for what makes a good presentation - rather than allowing ourselves to be bowled over by big numbers and even bigger claims, I want to see a world where people clamor for a more reasonable, measured approach.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a feeling it would go a long way towards reconciling the fringe with the mainstream.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>I’m sure some of my followers have seen my recent social media posts regarding the 200+ Raspberry Pi Model B’s I purchased on ebay – if you have not then follow my <a href="https://twitter.com/jmdawson_blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitter</a> for sneak peaks and updates!</p>



<div><p>I purchased the job lot of Pi’s for just £61 although there was a catch – they were listed as broken and I believe they are customer returns. They are all Model B’s with with either 256MB or 512MB of RAM and are in various conditions. </p><p>The first step in repairing these is to diagnose the issues, I created some tooling to assist with this which I will cover now.</p></div>



<h2>Pi Diagnostics</h2>



<p>So how do you go around diagnosing 200+ faulty Raspberry Pi’s? Regardless of how clever I get around this its not going to be a fast process but I needed a plan. </p>



<div><p>I will be categorising the Pi’s into two categories those that boot and those that are or appear dead. The “Dead” Pi’s will be revisited at a later date but lets take a look at how I’ve gone about testing the ones that boot up. </p><p>Using a cheap 3.5″ TFT Pi display and a hacky bash script I have created a diagnostic tool that will test the following: </p></div>



<ul><li>USB Ports</li><li>Ethernet</li><li>Display Output</li></ul>



<p>This also gives me an opportunity to test the GPIO to an extent as the display uses the I2C, VCC and GND pins and also gives me a chance to assess the physical condition of the device. </p>

<p>So far I am around half way through the diagnostics and 59 of the Pi’s boot and work with minor damage such as snapped SD card slots or physically damaged USB ports.</p>



<p>10 of the Pi’s are fully working although their is no Ethernet – These will not be fixed as such although the Ethernet chip and port will be removed transforming the device into a Model A. </p>



<div><p>A further 4 devices are fully working although the HDMI port doesn’t work, all 4 of these look to have damaged traces on the PCB around the HDMI circuitry – I will not be fixing these although I can make them safe to run headless. </p><p>A further 40 Pi’s are dead although some of them are likely just broken power delivery circuits which should be easy fixes – I will revisit these in the near future. </p><p>Here are the remaining devices that need to be diagnosed: </p></div>

<div><p>Over the next few days I will diagnose the remaining devices and add a follow up post that will have a total count of Pi’s in the box and a count of the ones that I believe are repairable. </p></div>



<h2>Repairing the Pi’s</h2>



<p>Although I haven’t finished diagnosing the Pi’s I couldn’t help but repair a few of the easier fixes, lets look at a few repairs I carried out this morning.</p>



<h3>Bent GPIO pins</h3>

<p>How the hell does this happen?! one of the Pi’s had the GPIO pins swashed flat. I could have replaced the header but as no pins were snapped I carefully straightened them a metal ruler. <br></p>

<p>Ok broken is an understatement! This poor Pi has had the ports ripped right off it, fortunately there is plenty dead Pi’s that will not be fixable so rather than buying parts I salvaged the USB ports from a dead Pi. </p>

<p>There we have it, another Pi saved from the scrap pile! </p>



<p>I know people are excited to see the board level repairs but I can assure that they are coming, there are just a lot of devices to go through and I want to get the easy fixes out of the way first. <br></p>



<div><p>I fixed several with broken USB ports and added them to the box of working Pi’s. I will be covering SD card slot repairs when my AliExpress parts arrive but for now this is all on the repairs. </p><p>Here is a final photo showing the so-far working devices: </p></div>

<h2>What am I going to do with 200 Raspberry Pi’s?!</h2>



<p>I’m sorry to disappoint but I won’t be building a cluster or decorating my walls with them! In fact I don’t have a project planned for these instead they will be sold on starting at £4 for a “Model A” and up to £9 for a fully boxed un-repaired Model B. I’m not doing this to make a quick buck I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!</p>



<p>I had a lot of suggestions to send the Pi’s to a developing Country for students to learn IT on and whilst I really like that idea the logistics of it and finding someone trustworthy enough to hand them out aren’t straight forward. Then there is the issue or 200 Pi’s requiring SD cards, Keyboards, Mice and Displays A board alone just isn’t enough here and its just not simple or easy for me to do. Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money! </p>



<p>I will post an update tomorrow with the results of the diagnostics and a link where you can purchase the repaired devices – UK only though I’m afraid unless you are willing to cover the shipping. </p>



<p>Let me know what you think of this mammoth task in a comment below and please consider following this blog for updates. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Cleaning up resources is one fo the most difficult things in Go. If careful attention isn’t paid to files,
network connections, or goroutines then a special type of memory leaked, called a resource leak, can occur.
One of the most effective way to identify resource leaks I’ve found are “baseline” tests. These tests establish
a healthy baseline. Next some work is simulated. The final step is to verify that the baseline was returned to,
once the work has completed.</p><p>Baseline tests are a reactionary way to detect resource leaks. This means that a resource leak must <em>already</em> be
present in code. Contrast this with a proactive detection mechanism such as a static analysis. In static analysis
a check may be performed to ensure that every <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Closer"><code>io.Closer</code></a>, has <code>Close()</code> called
on it within the function scope the resource was opened. Another strategy to manage resource leaks is a strict adherence to convention. i.e.
ensure that every goroutine that’s started has a way to finish, or <code>defer</code>ing <code>Close()</code> right after a resource is
successfully opened.</p><p>A baseline tests involves starting your application and then generating some short-lived test load.
Below shows an example of a baseline test.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The graph shows the # of objects allocated by go. The flat sections of the graph display the “baseline”. The
spikes indicate load is being applied.</p><p>After the program is initialized it is a flat steady line. Then some load is applied to the program. Afterwards
the runtime returns to the initial flat line. When resources leak the # of objects will increase after each
application of load, and the flat “baseline” sections will slowly grow.</p><p>The next graph shows a base line tests affect on the # of goroutines. During steady state 11 goroutines are

<p>Here's how to stop being so darn precious about your blogging: <strong>The third time you use an idea in a conversation, you have to blog about it.</strong></p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dgn7cqkm5385vom48amy.png" alt="Visualized three strikes rule">
</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why</a></h2>
  <p>People often wonder what to blog about. You can get really fancy with Google keyword research and content calendars and the like. It's too complicated for me, and often leads to the kind of impersonal, SEO-driven blogposts that are slowly ruining the web.</p>
  <p>We need a simple, authentic heuristic to decide. Let's think about the upper and lower bounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's possible to blog too much — nobody wants you to broadcast every waking thought.</li>
    <li>But it's more likely that we are just <em>not blogging enough</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What's obvious to you is often not obvious to others. How often do you speak with someone and casually mention something that is new to them?</p>
  <p>Pretty often.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png" alt="xkcd 1053">
  </p>
  <p>It's natural to want to hold off publishing our insights and discoveries until the magical right time when it all clicks together in one beautiful, perfect essay that springs forth fully formed from our foreheads, making us famous and showing the world how smart we are.</p>
  <p>We want it so much we end up <strong>never writing it</strong>.</p>
  <p>This is how the world misses out on so much of our unique voices, taste, and perspectives.</p>
  <p>The Three Strikes Rule is designed as both a filter (for passing thoughts) and a prompt (for you to write more).</p>
  <p><strong>To stop being so precious</strong> about your blog.</p>
  <p><strong>To share ideas</strong> more openly and freely with your readers.</p>
  <p><strong>To <a href="https://www.swyx.io/create_luck/">Create Luck</a></strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>To create one reference</strong> for that bunch of links you always end up searching for when you write or answer questions.</p>
  <p>And, quite honestly, <strong>to write shorter blogposts</strong>. Nobody has time to read the 3,000 word preamble to your magnum opus. It's a blog, not a physical book — you can return over time to expand it if it's worth it (like <a href="https://www.swyx.io/LIP">this</a> or <a href="https://www.swyx.io/how-to-name-things/">this</a>).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sidenote: Some people call these "blogs that grow over time" a <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">digital garden</a>. The mental masturbation crowd prefer <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten</a> because it sounds foreign. It doesn't matter what you call it, it matters that you do it and grow it.</p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="how"><a href="#how">How</a></h2>
  <p>Let's say we accept that "the 3rd time we reference an idea in a conversation, we have to blog about it". What does that really mean?</p>
  <p>I take an expansive view of what "ideas" and "conversations" means.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ideas</strong> includes great talks, good books, useful concepts, obscure names, handy definitions, copied-and-pasted code snippets, historical facts, surprising charts, and even blogposts by other people. (Yes, you can blog about other blogs. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-power-of-lampshading/">Like this</a>. Why not?) Sometimes the idea will be your own, most times it will be your takes on others'.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversations</strong> include in-person, on Zoom, on Twitter, wherever you communicate and exchange ideas.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The first time</strong> you refer to an idea, you probably just learned about it. It might be a fad; you may never find the idea useful again. Let it go.</p>
  <p><strong>The second time</strong> you refer to the idea, you should be taking note. Ideas are things we find useful in our day-to-day conversations, and there's probably a good amount of our readers who would too. But it might <em>still</em> fade away, so we hold off on it. It still needs to <strong>prove its usefulness</strong>.</p>
  <p>By <strong>the third time</strong> you refer to an idea, it's no longer a coincidence. It's a pattern. You're increasingly likely to refer to it again in future. It's marinated in your head for a bit, and you've likely gained some experience explaining it to others. It's also not so old that it may have lost relevance. It's time to write it down <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes">to save keystrokes</a>.</p>
  <p>Do I <em>literally</em> write everything down after the 3rd time? No, sometimes the "three strikes" becomes the "five strikes" or the "ten strikes" rule, mostly out of laziness. But I know I <em>should</em>. With this rule, I find that I blog more and people still get value out of the core idea.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In case you were wondering... yes the "reference counter" on the Three Strikes rule itself got up to about 8 or 9 before I wrote this post. 🙈</p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="delivery"><a href="#delivery">Delivery</a></h2>
  <p>Following this rule will dramatically increase the volume of your output. There's then the question of how to deliver these high frequency things. There are a few methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tweet it out</li>
    <li>Dump them in a github repo (<a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">like this</a>)</li>
    <li>Split your blog from "only having essays" mode to having both "essays" and "notes". Publish separate RSS feeds for them.</li>
    <li>Buffer them up for a "grab bag post" like <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/what-ive-been-reading-183.html">Tyler Cowen</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personally, I am exploring doing this with a <a href="http://swyx.transistor.fm/">daily podcast</a>. See what works for you.</p>
  <p>If you're worried that people will think you're too noisy, you probably shouldn't.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"You’ll worry less about what people think about you when you realize how seldom they do." - David Foster Wallace, <em>Infinite Jest</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>I'd love for you to share great ideas more freely.</strong> Great ideas deserve to be shared, and your readers will appreciate it.</p>

<![CDATA[Why am I wasting time on EndBASIC?]]>

January 23, 2021 | https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>If you have been following this blog or my social profiles for the last year, you are probably aware that <a href="https://jmmv.dev/tags/endbasic">I have been working on something called EndBASIC</a>. You also probably know that this is a retro-looking BASIC interpreter written in Rust that <a href="https://endbasic.jmmv.dev/">happens to run on the web</a>. And if you know those two things, you are probably wondering, like some of my friends do: why am I <em>wasting</em> time developing such a useless project? <strong>Because.</strong></p>
<p>No, seriously, because. It is obvious that the EndBASIC language and environment will not gain massive traction, and I do not have any interest in inventing a perfect new language (because, let’s face it, we already have one and it’s called Rust 😉).</p>
<p>So, then, why do I spend any of my scarce free time on this project? If you must know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a fun thing to do.</strong> Just like some people enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games, or crafting wood, I enjoy programming. It feels like a game. And EndBASIC <em>itself</em> could be seen as a game at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a form of art.</strong> Developing a personal project is a different experience than developing a work project. I can spend all the time in the world polishing the same turd over and over again, playing with different ideas until things look best.</p>
<p>If you have ever considered that programming may be art, then this kind of side project is where you crank your craft up a notch. As just one example, working on EndBASIC’s tests made me come up with the idea of <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html">using the builder pattern for tests</a> and it seemed to have been well-received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a learning experience.</strong> In writing EndBASIC, I’m playing with Rust. I strongly believe that Rust is one of the languages of the future and it’s the language that makes me say “aha, I agree” at every corner I turn. Yet, I haven’t mastered it. Working on Rust projects lets me learn a bunch of stuff about the language that will be helpful in future endeavors. And it’s not only about Rust per se: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">learning the idioms</a> used in this language can <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-protect-the-data.html">help write better code</a> in any other.</p>
<p>Another example is that I also got to learn about WASM, targeting the browser from a “native” app and making it work on various different devices. This led me down the path of async programming and how to interact with Javascript in that context—which was <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html">a painful but eventually-gratifying obstacle</a> to overcome.</p>
<p>And yet another example is that I also got to set up continuous <em>deployment</em>, first via Travis CI and then via the new GitHub Actions coolness. This, in turn, gave me ammo to write up more <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html">interesting</a> <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/do-not-submit.html">stuff</a> in this blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copying an “old technology” is irrelevant.</strong> Yes, BASIC is not the language of the future (although… VB.NET users may disagree with you because it supports, I don’t know, thousands of businesses?). But that doesn’t matter. Only 5,000 lines of the codebase (about 30% of the total) are devoted to parsing the language, and most of those lines are unit tests anyway. If I wanted to change the language per se to offer a more “modern” experience with things like first-order functions, objects, etc. it’d be <em>trivial</em> to do so.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no interest in building my own language as mentioned in the opening, but having worked on the <em>building blocks</em> of a real language is enlightening, and having those building blocks around will surely come in handy in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what happened to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html">original goal</a> of teaching programming to my kids via this project? Well… uhh… let’s say I’ve gotten distracted having fun by myself rather than actually getting them in front of this. I should get back to that goal after all the recent improvements to make the environment more usable and seeing if they care at all.</p>
<p>But yes. For the most part, EndBASIC is a crazy/useless language. Although… ~50 other people currently disagree with the thought of this being useless if <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">GitHub stars</a> mean anything at all 😉 If you are one of those ~50, thank you! And if you are not, join me in the craze?</p>
<p><strong>Edit (Jan 24th): If you are here from the recent bump in Hacker News, hello! I have <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/endbasic-0.5.html">just published the 0.5.0 release</a> which might answer some of the questions you have.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Consensus algorithms is a topic that always caught my attention: it is complex and hard and needs a precise and safe solution. In other words: We have a couple of machines forming a cluster, and they operate on identical copies of the same data and can continue operating even in the scenario of some servers being down. This approach is used to solve a bunch of problems in distributed systems.</p>

<p>To give a bit of background of where we currently stand, we have to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. Over the past decade or more, Paxos was almost synonymous with consensus, as it is the protocol taught in most computer science courses, and most implementations of consensus make use of it. The only problem is that Paxos is really difficult to understand, thus making it very hard to be implemented correctly. With that, Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">designed Raft</a>, with the most important goal of making it understandable.</p>

<p>Given that Raft focuses so much on understandability, it breaks down the consensus into three relatively independent subproblems (quoting the Raft paper):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader election: a new leader must be chosen when an existing leader fails.</li>
  <li>Log replication: the leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other logs to agree with their own</li>
  <li>Safety: if any server has applied a given log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log index.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, I will cover only the Leader election. The other two topics I will cover in the future in other blog posts!</p>

<h3 id="the-basics-of-raft-and-leader-election">The basics of Raft and leader election</h3>

<p>A Raft cluster is composed of several servers and five is a typical number, therefore allowing the system to have two failures. A server in this cluster is in one of three possible states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader: Handles all client requests.</li>
  <li>Followers: are passive, and only respond to requests from leaders.</li>
  <li>Candidate: a state used to elect a new leader.</li>
</ul>

<p>Raft divides time into terms of arbitrary length, and they are numbered with consecutive integers. Each one of these terms starts with an election, where one or more candidates attempt to become the leader of the cluster. When a candidate wins the election, it serves as the leader for the rest of the term. To explain this process a bit better, we can illustrate these transitions.</p>

<p><img src="http://laurocaetano.com/images/raft-states-2.png" alt="raft-states"></p>

<p>Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger elections. When a server joins the cluster, they begin as followers, and they remain in this state as long as they receive valid heartbeats from the current leader. The leaders send periodic heartbeats to all followers in order to notify them of the existence of it and maintain its authority. When a follower does not receive a heartbeat over a period of time, named in Raft “election timeout”, then it proceeds to start a new election.</p>

<p>A new election follows these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Changing the state from follower to candidate</li>
  <li>Increase the current term by 1</li>
  <li>Votes for itself</li>
  <li>Requests votes from all servers in the cluster</li>
  <li>If the server gets the majority of the votes, it assumes the role of leader</li>
  <li>Starts sending heartbeats to all followers, including the new term</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a very simplistic and short explanation for the leader election process, and for more details do not hesitate in <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">reading the paper</a>! It’s a very pleasant read.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-in-rust">Implementation in Rust</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a programming language designed for performance, safety, and safe concurrency. It is strongly typed, compiled, has no garbage collector, and has no runtime (a.k.a a very minimal runtime).</p>

<p>I got interested in Rust at the end of 2020, by reading a couple of blog posts. With that trigger, I decided to read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">The Rust Programming Language</a> book and started to code very small projects. Only that very small projects do not tell you much about the language in the real world. So I decided to implement something that is more related to what I work on on my daily basis: dealing with distributed systems.</p>

<p>Note: if you are not familiar with the language, you can quickly check <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/">the Gentle intro to Rust</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h4>

<p>I decided to use the most simple and basic constructs of the language. This means no big runtimes, libs that do most of the job and etc. So I ended up using only threads for concurrency, and TCP for the RPCs.</p>

<h5 id="reproducing-the-states-and-types-in-the-code">Reproducing the states and types in the code</h5>

<p>My initial approach was to find out which types were the most important ones, and reproduced them in the code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Examples of types.</span>
<span>enum</span> <span>State</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>FOLLOWER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>LEADER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>CANDIDATE</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>LogEntry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Heartbeat</span> <span>{</span> <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>peer_id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>SocketAddrV4</span><span>,</span>
    <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>,</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>log_entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogEntry</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Peer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>next_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Instant</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>
    <span>current_leader</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Leader</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Visit the file "types.rs" in the repo to see the all type definition.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And once my types were defined, I started to implement the state transitions step by step.</p>

<h5 id="a-server-starts-as-follower">A server starts as follower</h5>

<p>In order to reproduce this behavior, I implemented a <code>new</code> method inside <code>Server</code>, to ensure that all servers are started with this state.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span>
        <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>

            <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have a server that starts as follower! Let’s go and implement the rest of the state transitions.</p>

<h5 id="starting-an-election-when-a-timeout-occurs">Starting an election when a timeout occurs</h5>

<p>As mentioned before, a server in Raft times out when it does not receive a heartbeat from a leader in a predetermined amount of time. Each server has a randomized timeout setting, to ensure that servers time out at different times.</p>

<p>To implement that, I decided to do the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The final implementation is not exactly like this,</span>
<span>// but the idea is the same.</span>
<span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>server</span><span>.has_timed_out</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>new_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we have a thread that runs an infinite loop, always checking for the server’s timeout. Whenever it occurs, a new election is triggered.</p>

<p>The election process, in the happy path, occurs as follow:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 1. Changing the state from follower to candidate</span>
<span>server</span><span>.state</span> <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>CANDIDATE</span><span>;</span>

<span>// 2. Increase the current term by one</span>
<span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>server</span><span>.refresh_timeout</span><span>();</span>

<span>// 3. Vote for itself</span>
<span>server</span><span>.voted_for</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Peer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.address</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>// 4. Prepare vote requests and make the RPC request</span>
<span>let</span> <span>request_vote_rpc</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>VoteRequest</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>new_term</span><span>,</span>
    <span>candidate_id</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>let</span> <span>rpc_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>rpc_client</span><span>.request_vote</span><span>(</span><span>request_vote_rpc</span><span>);</span>

<span>// 5. if the server gets the majority of votes, becomes leader</span>
<span>if</span> <span>has_won_the_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>rpc_response</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// 6. sends heartbeats to all followers</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>log_entry</span> <span>=</span> <span>LogEntry</span><span>::</span><span>Heartbeat</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span><span>,</span>
        <span>peer_id</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>rpc_client</span><span>.broadcast_log_entry</span><span>(</span><span>log_entry</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="election-timeout-and-discovering-another-leader">Election timeout and discovering another leader</h5>

<p>In case a timeout occurs or the server does not get the majority of the votes, it will start the election once again, increasing the term once more. In Raft, it is totally fine to have terms without a leader.</p>

<p>Another interesting case can occur during the election process: another server in the cluster is elected, and starts sending heartbeats. When this occurs, our server changes back the state from <code>CANDIDATE</code> to <code>FOLLOWER</code>, and set the terms to the current leader’s term.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Example of how a server behaves when receiving heartbeats</span>
<span>// It becomes a follower if the received heartbeat has a higher</span>
<span>// term than itself.</span>

<span>if</span> <span>term</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>info!</span><span>(</span>
        <span>"Server {} becoming follower. The new leader is: {}"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>,</span> <span>peer_id</span>
    <span>);</span>

    <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>=</span> <span>term</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.state</span> <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>FOLLOWER</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.voted_for</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.current_leader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Leader</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>peer_id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
        <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>term</span><span>,</span>
    <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that, we have covered all the steps for the state transitions in Raft’s leader election algorithm!</p>

<h5 id="more-info-about-the-full-implementation">More info about the full implementation</h5>

<p>The core logic for the leader election is implemented in the <code>raft::core</code> package, where functions to handle log entries (heartbeats), elections, and timeouts are placed. Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/core.rs">full implementation</a> for a more detailed look into the code.</p>

<p><em>Important notes</em></p>

<p>RPCs are done through TCP connections. Each server starts up with a TPC listener, and create client connections to all other servers in the cluster.</p>

<p>The implementation is not making usage of persistent storage, so all operations are done in memory. For this reason, the <code>Server</code> instance is shared across many functions, by making usage of Rust’s <code>Arc</code> and <code>Mutex</code> combination. It took me a while to understand the concepts, but once you get the basics, it turns out very simple!</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/demo.rs">demo</a>, which runs and demonstrates the process of electing a leader in a new cluster. By running it, we get the following output:</p>

                    <p>Launching an MVP is the only way to get real user feedback on your startup. Rather than build out a custom backend, <a href="https://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> exposes your Postgres DB tables as a REST API. <strong>Put those first months of engineering focus into the frontend and unique business logic - save the custom backend for when you need to scale.</strong></p><blockquote>Using PostgREST is an alternative to manual CRUD programming. Custom API servers suffer problems. Writing business logic often duplicates, ignores or hobbles database structure. Object-relational mapping is a leaky abstraction leading to slow imperative code. The PostgREST philosophy establishes a single declarative source of truth: the data itself. - <a href="https://postgrest.org/">https://postgrest.org/</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a> is an ideal compute platform for PostgREST. Being serverless, it is very efficient in terms of cost and operations. Yet Fargate containers are relatively long-lived compared to AWS Lambda - this allows PostgREST's caching mechanisms to remain effective.</p><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><ul><li>You'll need an AWS account and its associated access/secret keys.</li><li>Install the AWS CLI [<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html">directions here</a>], and configure your AWS keys [<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config">directions here</a>].</li><li>The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/fargatecli">Fargate CLI</a> is the easiest way to deploy a container on AWS. You'll want to install it [<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/fargatecli/releases">download here</a>].</li><li>A Postgres database. Your Fargate task(s) will need network access to this database. If you are using RDS, be sure to specify subnets and security groups for your load balancer and tasks (see below) so they get deployed in the same VPC as your database.</li></ul><h2 id="ship-it">Ship it</h2><h3 id="1-setup-a-test-db-api-role-and-table-in-postgres-">1. Setup a test DB, API, role, and table in Postgres:</h3><p>Connect to Postgres, then create a database for this exercise:</p><pre><code>postgres=&gt; create database startup;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=&gt; \c startup;
psql ...
You are now connected to database "startup" as user "root".
startup=&gt;</code></pre><p>PostgREST uses a "naked schema" to identify which DB tables should be exposed in the API. We can create one, and add a sample table:</p><pre><code>startup=&gt; create schema api;
CREATE SCHEMA

startup=&gt; create table api.trees (id serial primary key, name text not null, species text not null);
CREATE TABLE

startup=&gt; insert into api.trees (name, species) values ('Banyan', 'Ficus benghalensis'), ('Quaking Aspen', 'Populus tremula'), ('American Elm', 'Ulmus americana'), ('Red Maple', 'Acer rubrum');
INSERT 0 4</code></pre><p>Finally, we need to set up two roles. The first controls anonymous access with Postgres' standard grants and (optionally) row-level security. PostgREST uses the <code>authenticator</code> role to connect to the database. Once connected, PostgREST assumes the <code>web_anon</code> role. <em>Please pick a better password than 'secret1'.</em></p><pre><code>create role web_anon nologin;

grant usage on schema api to web_anon;
grant select on api.trees to web_anon;

create role authenticator noinherit login password 'secret1';
grant web_anon to authenticator;</code></pre><p>This structure ensures you are not using the <code>root</code> user for PostgREST connections and makes it easy to add <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut1.html">JWT-authenticated roles</a> in the future.</p><p>A more detailed PostgREST setup tutorial is available here: <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut0.html">https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut0.html</a></p><h3 id="2-deploy-an-application-load-balancer-to-route-traffic-to-your-fargate-task-s-">2.

This is with the smallest single instance available - there is tons of room to scale both vertically and horizontally with this architecture.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> the load balancer costs are more significant (~$16+/mo), but they are included in the "free tier" and can be shared between many Fargate (and Lambda/EC2) services.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><ul><li>Looking for more than a read-only API? You can enable authenticated access to read and write private information in your database. PostgREST supports JWT authentication, which maps to Postgres roles you configure. You can even enable row-level security. <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut1.html">Tutorial is here</a>, with <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/auth.html">further details here</a>.</li><li>Please enable TLS (SSL) on your load balancer, and require encrypted connections to PostgREST. We don't want your credentials leaking!</li><li>In production, you might use an infrastructure-as-code tool like Terraform or CDK to deploy your Fargate tasks.

The rest proxy through <strong>main</strong>. It has the highest RAM and largest storage since it needs to run multiple GitLab CI build jobs, perform proxying to the other instances, and run a VPN so I can access the local network from anywhere. It also acts a Kubernetes node, but typically doesn’t host anything unless the others are full.</p><p>The <strong>s1</strong> and <strong>s2</strong> instances are meant for hosting applications via Kubernetes.</p><p>The <strong>w1</strong> instance can be used for hosting applications via Kubernetes. But, it is more of a general purpose box to SSH into for ad-hoc Linux work, use as a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-deploy-on-remote-docker-hosts-with-docker-compose/#:~:text=A%20remote%20Docker%20host%20is,remote%20host%20in%20several%20ways.">remote Docker host</a>, and run long-running jobs or fan-spinning jobs I don’t want to run on my MacBook Pro.</p><h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2><h3 id="storage">Storage</h3><p>For storage I am using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Extreme-UHS-I-SDSDXXY-256G-GN4IN/dp/B07H9VX76D/ref=sr_1_2?crid=GZY4QWXOYYJR&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=sandisk+sdxc+card&amp;qid=1610551297&amp;sprefix=sandisk+sd+cards%2Caps%2C160&amp;sr=8-2">SDXC flash memory cards</a> instead of an external hard drive to keep it portable and fast. SDXC cards, however, can be prone to failure on heavy read/write workloads. I haven’t had too much of a problem with this though, using reputable cards from a manufacturer like SanDisk lowers the odds of a card failure. Any vital data is placed in or backed up to <a href="#system--storage">the s3fs mount</a> regularly.</p><h3 id="network-switch">Network Switch</h3><p>At the bottom, I am using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-8-Port-Gigabit-Ethernet-Unmanaged/dp/B07PFYM5MZ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3L02KVPMAQV8S&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=netgear+network+switch&amp;qid=1610513653&amp;sprefix=netgear+network%2Caps%2C170&amp;sr=8-3">NETGEAR Ethernet network switch</a> so I can plug in the cluster into a router using a single connection and that connection can be split 4 ways to each instance. While I always leave the instances plugged into the switch, I usually don’t connect the switch to a router as the instances <a href="#networking">can also connect over WiFi</a> and those speeds are tolerable most of the time.</p><h3 id="cable-management-and-power">Cable Management and Power</h3><p>In order to keep the build clean, short cables are used to connect the network cables to the network switch and the USB power cables to the reliable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-10-Port-Charger-PowerPort-iPhone/dp/B00YRYS4T4/ref=sr_1_13?crid=1KU57ZAEHMG8T&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=anker+usb+power+supply&amp;qid=1610513955&amp;sprefix=anker+usb+c+power%2Caps%2C187&amp;sr=8-13">Anker USB power supply</a>. Any longer cables are wound, zip-tied, and hidden in the back.</p><p>Since both the network switch and the USB power supply have an AC adapter, I attached a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSVER-Portable-Desktop-Charging-Station/dp/B074KBN8FY/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mini+power+strip&amp;qid=1610514053&amp;sr=8-11">mini power strip</a> at the top that they both plug into, so there is only one external power cable coming out of the otherwise self-contained cluster that needs to be plugged into the wall.</p><h2 id="system--storage">System &amp; Storage</h2><p>The system runs <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">Ubuntu Server Edition for Raspberry Pi</a>. I have flashing scripts that can flash SDXC cards with the operating system and custom initialization scripts for each instance. The initialization scripts handle numerous things including:</p><ul><li>Installing and running instance specific applications (<a href="https://microk8s.io/">Kubernetes via microk8s</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html">GitLab CI Runner</a>, <a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.0/getting-started/install-traefik/">Traefik</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server">VPN server</a>, etc.) and polls for updates to the initialization scripts using a cron so I can modify the software stack without re-flashing.</li><li>Mounting an S3 bucket via <a href="https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse">s3fs</a> for remote storage and shared storage between the cluster instances.</li><li>The entire operating system is commited to a Git repository at the root <code>/</code>. This saves a checkpoint of the server’s file system before anything else is installed. Then, with a script containing some simple <code>git</code> commands I can blow everything away if I need to restore and start an instance over from scratch without having to pop out the SDXC card and re-flash. This can be tricky since <code>git</code> isn’t made for volatile use cases like this, but it has worked suprisingly well with a proper <code>.gitignore</code> file.</li></ul><h2 id="networking">Networking</h2><p>The initialization scripts automatically connect to WiFi so an Ethernet connection is not required, but can be used.</p><p>The <strong>main</strong> instance is exposed to the external network. The router port forwards specific ports to the <strong>main</strong> instance and other instances are proxied to <strong>main</strong> via Kubernetes and then Traefik exposes Kubernetes services and the VPN server to the external internet on <strong>main</strong>. The <strong>main</strong> instance updates a Route53 DNS record with its public IP address every few minutes as a method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS">dynamic DNS</a>.</p><p>Traefik and/or Kubernetes with <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/">cert-manager</a> automatically issues TLS certificates for applications using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</p><p>Finally, instances can be accessed at hostnames like <code>main.local</code> or <code>s1.local</code> on the local network for SSH access automatically because the instances will publish themselves via the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/avahi">Avahi daemon</a> using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)">Bonjour/Zeroconf protocol</a>.</p><h2 id="running-x86-on-raspberry-pi">Running x86 on Raspberry Pi</h2><p>The biggest downside to running on Raspberry Pi right now is the fact that it runs on ARM. That means many GitLab CI builds will fail since the Docker images might only be available for x86. There’s reason to believe this might change since Apple’s new chips are ARM-based and that will surely push adoption forward.</p><p>For now, however, I implemented a solution similar to Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304182/apple-arm-mac-rosetta-2-emulation-app-converter-explainer">Rosetta 2</a> for running x86 applications on ARM. I use <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/QemuUserEmulation">QEMU’s user emulation</a> along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc"><code>binfmt_misc</code></a> capability of the Linux kernel to transparently run x86 executables on the instances. This can also be done to <a href="https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static">enable running and building x86 Docker images</a>.</p><p>However, just doing this, doesn’t seamlessly work as dynamically linked binaries need to be able to access x86 shared libraries not ARM ones. In order to solve this, I download a x86 version of the same Ubuntu Server image and place the files in a directory <code>/x86_root/</code>. Then, I use <code>chroot</code> to run the x86 version of <code>/x86_root/bin/bash</code> against <code>/x86_root/</code>. The result is a nice working x86 shell on your ARM-based Raspberry Pi!</p><p>I go one step further and wrap running the shell with <code>chroot</code> into an executable script. I create a new SSH user <code>ajay-x86@</code> that allows me to SSH and drop directly into an x86 shell instead of the native ARM shell I would get if SSH into <code>ajay@</code>.</p><p>The whole solution is elegant, simple, and has worked extremely well in my usage.</p><h2 id="casing-and-cooling">Casing and Cooling</h2><p>The Pi boards are cased for protection along with a fan to prevent throttling of the CPU. The fan usually keeps it below $50^{\circ}$ celsius on idle and $70^{\circ}$ celsius at peak.</p><p>All of the different boxes are attached together using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JHQJHP4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">ceramic magnets</a> (which are glued to the surfaces with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KPYB05A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">cyanoacrylate glue</a>). This allows them to be disassembled and quickly snapped back together for easy portable transport in a smaller container.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2020/06/magnets.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Magnetic Connectors" title="Magnetic Connectors" width="200"><figcaption>Yeah, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/J0IqVC8mTwk?t=149">magnets</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="cost">Cost</h2><p>All in all, the system cost around ~$600. The equivalent instances on AWS would cost around (without accounting for bandwidth / storage costs):</p><p>$$ 1 \space\text{8GB instance} * $0.05\space/\space\text{hour} * 24 * 30 * 12 $$
$$ +\space 3 \space\text{4GB instances} * $0.04\space/\space\text{hour} * 24 * 30 * 12 $$
$$ = $1,468.80\space/\space\text{year} $$</p><p>Yes, you could likely optimize this cost a little bit using RIs or a different host, but as a rough calculation, it works out to be much more affordable (especially over multiple years) and you get to avoid the suprise bills of AWS services.</p><p>But, you should still probably only use this for development or individual use cases, even though it can be served to the internet.</p><h2 id="size">Size</h2><p>Finally, for a sense of scale, the server is actually not that large and can be tucked away pretty easily especially since it can connect via WiFi.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2020/06/server_scale.jpg" loading="lazy" width="300"></figure></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In a previous post I wrote that I live in a part of the world that <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/28/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/" data-type="post" data-id="107">does not provide unlimited internet</a>.</p>
<p>This means data is valuable, and if I run out of data, I have to pay a premium amount to activate a data add-on which can be quite expensive. There is one router at our apartment, and we all share the data among ourselves, and we hope that we are all using in a fair manner without over spending on streaming, or downloads, in an unfair way. </p>
<p>The easiest way for anyone to do is use the nighttime data for their streaming and downloads, and leave to peak day time data for office and other important work. (Yes if you are reading this from USA, we have peak and off peak time data for home broadband)</p>
<p>A detailed usage report provided by my ISP suggested to me that there is a WhatsApp addict in my apartment, who is spending large amount of data for WhatsApp video calls.</p>
<p>Since I’m the person who is paying the internet bill, and I need data for more important work than making WhatsApp video calls, I wanted a way to stop people from spending my data in unnecessarily ways, and use their own mobile data if they have to make WhatsApp or any other video calls.</p>
<p>Since I can’t go and ask from each and every individual whether they are spending too much time on WhatsApp video calls, I decided to block all WhatsApp communications at the router level.</p>
<p>Initially I thought this would be a walk in the park, just log in to my router dashboard, and block the WhatsApp URL, IP addresses and ports. Just a two minute job.</p>
<p>But this lead me to rabbit hole that too more than several hours, and made me yield without finding a solution.</p>
<h2>Google search</h2>
<p>A search on Google shows that people have been asking for a way to block WhatsApp, going back to several years.</p>
<p>The first approach which I found in a StackOverflow answer was to block the domain <strong><em>c.whatsapp.net </em></strong> according to the answer, this is the domain which handshakes at initiation of the app. And according to the poster, if we can block this domain, we would be able to block initiation a connection to WhatsApp server, and therefore successfully block WhatsApp.</p>
<p>I flagged the domain and tested, but to it did not prove to successfully block WhatsApp.</p>
<p>So I decided to search even further, another <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/203475/how-to-block-whatsapp-traffic-in-tp-link-router" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answer also posted on StackOverflow</a> told me to block some ports, with TCP and UDP connections. These included TCP ports 5222, 5223, 5228 and 3478.</p>
<p>I painstakingly blocked all upstream and downstream TCP and UDP connections from my router, hoping it would block WhatsApp. But that did not also proved to be effective.</p>
<h2>Trying to find an IP addresses</h2>
<p>There has to be a way to block WhatsApp right? So why can’t I find an IP address or list of IP addresses, that I can block from my router, and finally block WhatsApp for good?</p>
<p>There was one IP address range that I found in the same SO answer, 31.13.64.0/18.</p>
<p>So I decided to block the IP addresses, and tested to see if it works, but unfortunately that also did not seem to work.</p>
<p>So I did further digging, and came to the GitHub post, which showed a comprehensive list of domains and IP addresses, that according to the poster, should be able to successfully block WhatsApp, or most of the connections to WhatsApp.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-blocking-WhatsApp">https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-blocking-WhatsApp</a></p>
<p>There it seems WhatsApp has multiple domains from c.whatsapp.net to c20.whatsapp.com and e.whatsapp.net to e20.whatsapp.com.</p>
<p>Also multiple IP ranges, and ports, but even though I tried all of them, none seemed to work. Why can’t I block a simple app from accessing though my router?</p>
<p>I guess they may have changed their domains, or added more domains and IP addresses by now, since WhatsApp has grown in popularity since most of these answers were posted on different forums.</p>
<h2>WhatsApp will tell you their IPs, only if you pay</h2>
<p>It seems like WhatsApp shares there IP addresses only to network operators and if you pay them to do it. </p>
<blockquote><p>WhatsApp is currently providing special pricing campaign service for Mobile operators, the IP pool is only available for those operators. Please note that we have migrated the latest IP pools of WhatsApp to Facebook Mobile Partner Portal and the IP pool update process has been fully automated.</p><cite><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/cidr.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.whatsapp.com/cidr.txt</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>So there is no way for me to know what are the IP addresses and ports that I should block in order to prevent WhatsApp from using my network, without randomly blocking ports and IPs and breaking my access to internet.</p>
<p>It seems almost all the posts I found on the internet, the people who originally asked the question also did not find a clear way to block WhatsApp. So I guess it’s not just me.</p>
<p>So how would you block WhatsApp if you faced with a similar situation? If you want your employees to stop using WhatsApp or other IM service during their working hours?</p>
<p>I’m left with no other option but to change my router password, so no one else can access internet via my router and my internet connection.</p>

<p>BERLIN — A call for Berlin to renew its commitment to NATO’s nuclear defense in a gesture of solidarity with the United States has prompted a heated backlash among Germany’s Greens, the party seen as the likely kingmaker in the country’s next government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high-profile group of German and American academics and strategic advisers delivered the NATO call in a more than 8,000-word&nbsp;<a href="https://anewagreement.org/en/" target="_blank">paper</a>&nbsp;titled “More Ambition, Please!,” urging Berlin to seize the moment presented by the change in administration in Washington.</p>



<p>“The erosion of transatlantic relations is a strategic crisis for Germany,” the signatories argue in a prelude to specific policy recommendations for transatlantic cooperation on everything from climate change to trade. “Without this alliance, a stable and united Europe cannot be sustained, and neither can the international order be renewed.”</p>



<p>While such conclusions may sound self-evident to American ears, they are not universally shared in Germany, especially when it comes to the country’s role in NATO and in ensuring Europe’s nuclear defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those questions remain particularly contentious in the Green party, which, despite moderating its stances on many policy fronts in recent years, never abandoned its pacifist, antiwar roots. Support for the transatlantic declaration by moderate forces in the party triggered a fierce reaction by leading members of the Greens’ left wing, underscoring the difficulty that lies ahead for the Biden administration as it seeks to repair and renew America’s strategic bonds in Europe following the divisive Trump years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m very irritated,”&nbsp;Agnieszka Brugger,&nbsp;deputy leader of the Greens’ parliamentary group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/gruene-heinrich-boell-stiftung-verteidigungspolitik-1.5182258" target="_blank">told</a>&nbsp;the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. She said she was especially annoyed that the paper was supported by Ellen Ueberschär, the co-head of the Heinrich Böll Stiftung, the Greens’ de facto in-house think tank (Ueberschär not only signed the controversial paper, she co-wrote an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/transatlantisch-traut-euch-wir-brauchen-eine-neue-uebereinkunft/26827522.html" target="_blank">op-ed</a>&nbsp;in Berlin’s Tagesspiegel encouraging others to embrace the initiative as well.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper’s signatories – a group that includes the likes of James D. Bindenagel, a retired American ambassador who spent much of his career in Germany, and Boris Ruge, a German ambassador currently serving as deputy head of the&nbsp;<a href="https://securityconference.org/en/" target="_blank">Munich Security Conference</a>&nbsp;— acknowledge the corrosive effect Donald Trump had on the alliance, while also highlighting “German neglect and failures” on defense spending and in pursuing the controversial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-joe-biden-nord-stream-2/">Nord Stream 2</a>&nbsp;pipeline project with Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group ascribes a central role to Germany in Europe’s broader effort to keep the U.S. engaged in the region, saying that in order to meet that responsibility, Germany should accelerate its push to increase defense spending to ensure “a deployable military.” Critics say Germany’s military, known as the Bundeswehr, has been plagued for years by underfunding and chronic mismanagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A deployable military gives weight to diplomacy, adds an indispensable contribution to transatlantic credibility, strengthens the deterrence capability of NATO, and consequently defends the freedom of German citizens,” the paper argues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A key aspect of Germany’s mission should be to remain engaged in NATO’s “nuclear-sharing arrangements,” a reference to Germany’s longstanding commitment to deliver U.S. atomic bombs in the event of an attack. To maintain that role, Berlin needs to replace the country’s aging fleet of combat aircraft equipped to carry out the role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The U.S. nuclear shield is essential to all non-nuclear NATO countries in Europe,” the paper says.&nbsp;“It should exist for as long as nuclear weapons exist and the nuclear threat looms.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But many on Germany’s left, including factions in both the Green party and the Social Democrats, oppose the move and want the U.S. to remove the nuclear warheads it has stationed in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Greens have enshrined the goal of a nuclear-free Europe into their party platform, some in the party see the weapons as a necessary evil for as long as Europe remains threatened by Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That pragmatic approach to security has helped broaden the party’s appeal to centrist voters in recent years and is one reason why many political observers believe it is likely to enter a coalition with the center-right Christian Democrats, Germany’s dominant political force, after national elections in the fall. The Greens are currently polling at about 20 percent, more than double their showing in the last election in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the party’s newfound mainstream appeal, the friction over Germany’s continued role in guaranteeing NATO’s nuclear deterrent suggests that Green acceptance of existing norms is far from settled.</p>



<p>Many in the party believe Germany should abandon NATO’s spending target, which calls on members to strive towards investing 2 percent of their GDP on defense. Brugger, in her Süddeutsche interview, called the focus on military spending “false and dangerous.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some Greens also want Germany to sign the United Nations’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/tpnw/" target="_blank">nuclear ban treaty</a>, which goes into effect on Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is Jürgen Trittin, a veteran Green MP and former minister. He&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JTrittin/status/1352367821003628547" target="_blank">tweeted</a>&nbsp;that he could only “slap his forehead” over Ueberschär’s support for the initiative to renew the transatlantic alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the Greens’ moderate and more ideological wings have a long history of locking horns on policy issues, the military question is particularly explosive because opposition to all things nuclear lies at the core of the party’s identity.</p>



<p>Even so, the party has a history of breaking with orthodoxy, most notably by&nbsp;<a href="http://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=3723" target="_blank">supporting</a>&nbsp;NATO’s 1999&nbsp;military intervention in Kosovo. If the Greens are to join the conservatives in forming a government after the September election, the consensus-driven party may have no choice but to redraw its red lines once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/graphics/Verdana_I.gif">
n a recent interview, Bill Zeitler, IBM's General Manager for the AS/400 Division, was asked a very blunt question: What are you betting the AS/400 business on today?  His answer, in all of two words, was "Network Computing".  In the next breath, he explained that he wasn't just talking about connectivity, but about conducting business electronically, over the Internet, and largely by virtue of a superior Java environment.

</p><p>
It's remarkable to think that IBM is basing so much of its future on, of all things, a programming language, and on a programming language that not only didn't exist a few years ago, but also was developed by an IBM competitor, Sun Microsystems.  What on earth could a new programming language offer to merit such attention?  Some new killer op-code?  A revolutionary new way to program a do-loop?

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1. ">

</p><p>
The answer is that there is not much in the Java language itself to write home about - it is a slightly simplified and streamlined version of C++, with some features that make it suitable for running applications over a network - the Internet, for an obvious example.  However, Java does have the revolutionary attribute of being hardware platform and operating system independent: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" is the battle cry of the Java faithful, and when you think about it, it certainly would change the industry landscape if hardware platforms and their respective operating systems became the handmaidens of applications, not vice versa.  Put a Java applet on your Web page, and it can be used, unchanged, by a Windows user in Buenos Aires, a Mac bigot in Australia, a Unix nut in Sweden, and an OS/2 diehard in Singapore (and all this with no royalties accruing to Microsoft!)

</p><p>
Thus, Java has the potential, at least, to break the hold that the hardware and operating system monoliths have on the computer world, and could make hardware and software tycoons like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as obsolete in the 21st century as railway barons have become in the 20th.  From IBM's point of view, if business application software were uncoupled from hardware platforms and operating systems, then computer systems could be sold on their own merits - robustness, security, manageability, etc. - and IBM no doubt feels that with the AS/400 they can compete quite well on that playing field.

</p><p>
Computer industry geopolitics aside, Java has become the Next Big Thing in the computer field - and if you're not constantly eager to get in on the Next Big Thing (even before you've fully mastered the Previous Three Big Things), then why the heck did you choose this industry to work in!

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-2.jpg" alt="Figure 2. ">

</p><p>
Since Java was introduced by Sun Microsystems, the Java Development Kit (JDK) has been available to be downloaded free over the Internet.  The JDK (now at version 1.1) includes a Java compiler, an applet viewer, and standard class libraries.  However, it is strictly command line based.  If you want to design the graphical interface of your application on-screen, as well as take advantage of the other benefits of graphical integrated development environments, you have to open your wallet a bit and look at something like Borland's JBuilder, Microsoft's Visual J++, or Symantec's Visual Café.  Or, as of July 25, IBM's Visual Age for Java.

</p><p>
The latest in IBM's Visual Age series of development environments had been available in a beta test version for several months, but recently Version 1.0 was officially released.  It's available in two flavours: the Professional Edition, and the pricier Enterprise Edition, which adds support for team development, as well as "Enterprise Access Builders" - tools for developing components to connect a Java client to various database platforms.  Within the Visual Age for Java environment you can create both applications and "applets" - Java programs that can be embedded in an HTML document and run by Web browsers which implement the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).  (Note that Visual Age for Java includes its own JVM as well as an applet viewer, so you can view and test your programs locally).  VA for Java also has a version control capability, and a debugger is included.

</p><p>
The Professional Edition is priced to compete with its counterparts mentioned above - that is, in the 100 - 200 dollar range per license.  However, if even that amount is a deterrent to you, the neophyte dabbler in Java, you may be interested to know that you can download a free copy of the Entry Edition - which contains all the functionality of the Professional Edition, minus only the documentation and online help, and limited to the creation of 100 classes.  In the remainder of this article, I'll show how you can download and install the Entry Edition of Visual Age for Java, and have a quick look at some of its features.

</p><p>
First, you'll have to consider the prerequisites, which are pretty significant, particularly for RAM.  You'll need Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or OS/2 Warp V4, an SVGA display, and, IBM says, 32MB of RAM (with 48MB recommended), at least 45MB of free disk space for the software (with an additional 30MB free disk space for swapping), and lastly, an unzip program.

</p><p>
If you're still standing, here's where you can find the Entry Edition on the Internet: <a href="http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava" target="_blank"> www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava</a>.  (Before downloading it, you should uninstall any Beta versions of the product from your system).  The Windows version of the download file (wenty100.ZIP) is a single .ZIP file almost 22MB in size - so you'll finally be able to wallpaper that bathroom while it's downloading.  Download it into a temporary directory, then unzip it.  One of the unzipped files is a setup.exe file, which can be invoked to complete the installation.  There is also an install.txt file with further installation and troubleshooting information.
After a successful installation, you'll have an "IBM Visual Age for Java" icon on your desktop to invoke the program.  It will bring up the Workbench window seen in Figure 1.  It will also bring up the "Quick Start" window seen in Figure 2 (which also can be brought up at any time from the Window… Quick Start… menu option).  If you select to create a new applet, as shown, you will be taken to a Smart Guide window (comparable to a Windows 95 "wizard"), which prompts you for applet name, project, and package, and whether you want to design the applet visually, or write source code for it.  If you select the former, the Visual Composition Editor is invoked (Figure 3).

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-3.jpg" alt="Figure 3. ">

</p><p>
The Visual Composition Editor allows you to create a graphical interface, with all the usual components - buttons, lists, menus, entry fields, etc., which it calls (in yet another of those coffee metaphors which are already becoming tiresome) "beans".  These are selectable from the left hand side of the window.  Beyond just laying out an application window, basic application logic can be constructed by making connections between components in the window (marked out with the dashed line), or with non-visual components outside the window.  In the example shown, the Remove button has been connected to the list, to indicate that clicking Remove should delete the highlighted item from the list.  The source code for this event logic is then generated automatically.
With Version 1.0, "beans" for all the standard Java Class Libraries are available.  In future, more sophisticated - and AS/400-specific - components will accessible, allowing, for example, access to files and fields in DB2/400, analogous to using externally described files in RPG/400.

</p><p>
Regardless of how many pre-built components, or "beans", are available, there will always be a requirement for new classes in any custom application.  VA for Java of course enables the creation of such classes in the old fashioned way - typing source code - with Smart Guides that prompt you and provide some of the fundamental class definition code.  And even if you are programming the old fashioned way, the VA for Java environment makes life easier by making instantly accessible the definitions of all the classes on the system and their methods, organized by their respective packages, whether standard Java classes or your own previously created classes (see again Figure 1).  If, like me, you've tried to learn and program Java from one of the many books available today, you may have been frustrated by not having access to such comprehensive documentation of the numerous standard Java classes.

</p><div><p>
What I've given above is just a quick overview of IBM's Java development environment - and admittedly not much reference is made to where the AS/400 comes into all this.  The AS/400, as of V3R7, does not currently natively support Java applications - a coming release of OS/400 will rectify that.  And as of the time of writing this article, much of the AS/400-specific Java development capability is still under construction.  In future articles, I hope to explore more AS/400-related capabilities of Java as they become available.  In the meantime, the latest scoop from IBM is of course available on the Internet, at www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava.

<h2><a name="caveat">CAVEAT</a></h2><a name="caveat">
<br>
This one of my pages is not well maintained.  This is a jumble of poorly-organized information; some info is quite useful, some is not.  I keep it around only because there of the few good nuggets buried in it.
</a><a name="the_problems_being_addressed"><h2>The problems being addressed</h2>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;Your web page the wrong characters coming out where accented letters should be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;You are upgrading from MySQL 4.0, where characters were simply bytes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;You are trying to wrap your head around how MySQL handles CHARSET / COLLATION.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;You upgraded, and now you are getting garbage.
<p>

Please read most of this document.  I know it is long (after all, I wrote it!)
But you really need to understand a lot of the pieces in it, in order
to solve your problem.
</p><p>

The tips in this document apply to MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona.
Version differences are called out where relevant.
</p></a><a name="basic_concepts"><h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<br>
"Character" and "byte" are different!
You must understand this before continuing.
A "byte" is an a-bit thing; it is the unit of space in computers (today).
A "character" is composed of one or more bytes, and represents what we think
of when reading.
<p>

A byte can represent only 256 different values.
There are over 11,000 Korean characters and over 40,000 Chinese characters --
no way to squeeze such a character into a single byte.
</p><p>

Charset vs collation.  These are different things!
'Charset' ('character set'; 'encoding') refers to the bits used to represent 'characters'.
'Collation' refers to how those bits could be compare for inequality (WHERE)
and sorting (ORDER BY).  GROUP BY and FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS can also involve collation.
And it even can involve deciding whether two different bit strings compare 'equal'.
</p></a><a name="history"><h2>History</h2>
<br>
1950's -- A character was (sometimes) represented in only 5 bits, on "paper tape"; no lowercase; had to "shift" to switch between letters and digits.
<br>
1960's -- A character was 6 bits; no lower case.  "Punched cards" were used.
<br>
1970's -- 7-bit ASCII becomes common -- that limits you to English.
And the 8-bit "byte" was invented and was coming into common usage (re: IBM 360).
<br>
1980's -- Beginning to see 8-bit encodings.  Especially since 7-bit ASCII
was wasting a bit of the omni-present "byte".
This can handle Western European accented letters.
<br>
1990's -- The computer world realizes that there are other people in
the world and embarks on Unicode and UTF8.  ("UTF" = "Unicode Transformation Format")
<p>

Meanwhile, MySQL is born,
but has enough problems without worrying about character sets.
Through version 4.0, a CHAR is just a byte.
You can put any kind of bytes, representing anything, into a VARCHAR.
Thus, begins the need for this discussion.
</p><p>

MySQL 4.1 introduced the concept of "character set" and "collation".
If you had legacy data or legacy code, you probably did not notice
that you were messing things up when you upgraded.
Or you started with 4.1 (or later) and "latin1 / latin1_swedish_ci"
and failed to notice that you were asking for trouble.
</p><p>

Today, it's pretty safe to simply lay down the law and say
"Use utf8 for all text."
If you have version 5.5.3 or later,
"Use utf8mb4 for all text."
</p><p>

Sure, there are other character sets,
and they are useful if you have a narrow focus.
But, you may as well use utf8mb4.
</p></a><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html">Another take on the History</a><a name="best_practice"><h2>Best Practice</h2>
<br>
Best practice is to go completely utf8mb4.
I will focus on utf8 and utf8mb4, but if you choose to do otherwise, keep reading;
most of this discussion can still be adapted to the charset of your choice.
<p>

For collation, probably the best 'overall' collation is utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci (if available) or utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci.
<i>0900</i> refers to UCA 9.0.  xxx_unicode_520_ci collations are based on UCA 5.2.0 weight keys: https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/5.2.0/allkeys.txt.
Unnumbered Collations are based on the older UCA 4.0.0.
</p><p>

A web page (if that is what you have) should begin with
</p><tt>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;</tt>
<p>

Establish the characterset for talking to the MySQL server:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><tt>init_connect = 'SET NAMES utf8'</tt>  in my.cnf
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>SET NAMES utf8</tt> -- done immediately after connecting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>SET GLOBAL VARIABLE character_set_...</tt> SET NAMES does the three you need.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases in your my.cnf (my.ini) file, add this under [mysql] or [client]: <tt>default-character-set = utf8</tt>
<p>

For PHP:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;(deprecated; DO NOT USE mysql_* !) mysql interface: </p><tt>mysql_set_charset('utf8');</tt> (assuming PHP 5.2.3 &amp; MySQL 5.0.7)  Note: "mysql_" interface is deprecated.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;mysqli interface: <tt>mysqli_set_charset('utf8') function</tt>.  See </a><a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.set-charset.php">mysqli_set_charset</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;PDO interface: set the charset attribute of the PDO dsn or via SET NAMES utf8mb4.
<a href="https://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.connection.php">PDO manual</a><p>

For Java (JDBC):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><tt>?useUnicode=yes&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8</tt> in the getConnection() call.
<br>
For Hikari (perhaps):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.characterEncoding=utf-8</tt>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.CharSet=utf-8</tt>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.useUnicode=true</tt>
<br>
(or maybe it is =yes and =utf8)
<p>

add
</p><pre>spring:
  datasource:
     connectionInitSql: "SET NAMES 'utf8mb4'"
</pre>
in the application.yml.  connectionInitSql is used by HikariCP when it open the connection.
<p>

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31096653/jsp-writing-utf8-to-mysql-wont-work">For Java/JSP</a><br>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45305951/1766831">Something about 'filters'</a></p><p>

SET NAMES can be invoked by your language just like
other non-SELECT commands: mysqli_query(), do(), execute(), etc.
</p><p>

I digress here for a note about GRANTs.
'root', and any other user from </p><tt>GRANT ALL ON *.*</tt>,
because it has "SUPER" privilege, will skip the <tt>init_connect</tt>,
so that technique is not 'perfect'.
<p>

<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-connection.html">SET NAMES</a></p><p>

Declare most CHAR/TEXT columns in all tables as CHARSET utf8.
Some exceptions: columns with hex (MD5, GUID), ...
These should be BINARY or CHAR charset ASCII.
</p><p>

Collation?
</p><p>

For true text, utf8_unicode_ci is best.  It handles the complex
rules of "combining chararacters", etc.
It handles essentially all languages simultaneously, but compromises on ordering.
</p><p>

utf8_general_ci is the default for utf8, so you may accidently
get this.  It is a little faster than utf8_unicode_ci and
works ok for many situations.
</p><p>

utf8_bin says to just compare the bytes.
CHAR/TEXT utf8 with utf8_bin validates (on INSERT) that the bytes comprise valid
utf8 bytes, but does not do anything useful for comparisions other than
exact (no case folding, etc) equality.
BINARY/BLOB should be usually be used instead CHAR+utf8;
this stores the bytes without any checking.
</p><p>

Alas, MySQL's collations think of case folding and accent-stripping as equivalent.
That is, there is no utf8 collation for case folding, but keeping accents distinct.
Do </p><tt>SHOW COLLATION LIKE '%cs';</tt> to see the few collations that work that way.
<p>

This document is evolving.  It started with just 'utf8', but the 'standard' is becoming 'utf8mb4'.
The document is inconsistent as to which it specifies.
If you are running MySQL before 5.5.3, you have only 'utf8'.
If you need Emoji or Chinese, then you need 'utf8mb4'.
</p><a name="conversions_and_common_errors"><h2>Conversions and Common Errors</h2>
<br>
This is a summary of how things work, and what is likely to go wrong.
<p>

There are 3 dimensions to character set problems:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;How the client's bytes are encoded when INSERTing, and what encoding you want when SELECTing;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;What SET NAMES you use (or what the default is);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHARACTER SET on the column definition.
</p><p>

All is well if the SET NAMES agrees with the encoding of the bytes in the Client.
The column's CHARACTER SET need not agree with SET NAMES; if they differ, a conversion will be performed for you.
If your characters exist in both encodings, the conversion will be transparent.
If a source character does not exist in the target encoding
(example: when converting a Chinese character from utf8mb4 to latin1), a "?" is usually put in its place.
</p><p>

The main thing that can go wrong is that SET NAMES can disagree with the Client's bytes.
Let's walk an acute-e (é) through the INSERT and SELECT.  First, note the encodings for é:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;Hex for latin1's 1-byte encoding: E9
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;Hex for utf8's 2-byte encoding: C3A9
<br>
(BTW, this and some other encodings are enumerated below.)
</p><p>

Case 1: SET NAMES latin1 (the default) is in effect and your application is thinking in utf8.
It INSERTs é encoded as utf8 (hex C3A9):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;C3A9 will become two latin1 characters: 'Ã©' "on the wire".  (C3 represents Ã in latin1, etc)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;If the CHARACTER SET for the column is latin1, then those 2 characters (2 bytes) are inserted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;If the CHARACTER SET for the column is utf8, then they are converted to utf8: Ã ⇒ C383 and © ⇒ C289; you insert 4 latin1 characters (4 bytes: C383C289) into the table.
<br>
Continuing the case, let's do a SELECT:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;For utf8 column, the C383C289 is converted to latin1 Ã© (C3A9) for sending across the wire to the client.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;For latin1 column, no conversion is performed, so, again, C389 goes across the wire.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The client receives the two bytes C389, thinking it is Ã© (because of SET NAMES).  However, the rest of your application is thinking 'utf8', it sees it as é.
<br>
C383C289 is an example of what I call "double encoding" because of the
two 'wrong' conversions from latin1 to utf8.
The resulting SELECT (at least for European text) looks exactly like what you INSERTed.
However, comparisions (WHERE x&gt;y) and sorting (ORDER BY) and, in a few cases, equality (x=y) will not work as expected.
</p><p>

Now, let's flip the situation:
Case 2: SET NAMES utf8, but you are inserting é encoded as latin1 (E9):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;SET NAMES is falsely asserting that E9 is a valid utf8 encoding of something, which it is not.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The INSERT finishes (with a WARNING that you probably ignored), but the string is truncated before the é.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHARACTER SET of the column does not matter since the string is truncated.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;A SELECT will get only the truncated string.
</p><p>

Case 3: One application INSERTs and another SELECTs, but they are using different SET NAMES.
All sorts of messes can occur.
</p><p>

Case 4: You have an old latin1 table (possibly dating back to …</p></a></div>

        <p>There are many interesting things that can be learned about probabilistic modelling from the world of trading and finance, where, perhaps due to the direct connection to very large sums of money,  attitudes to problems are generally very different to those of the typical statistician or ML practitioner. Two books I have enjoyed recently in the area are <em>The Education of a Speculator</em> by Victor Niederhoffer and <em>Fooled by Randomness</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The books are similar in many ways, both contain plenty of interesting insights into thinking probabilistically, as well as a number of cautionary tales of modelling gone wrong<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In <em>Fooled by Randomness</em>, Taleb talks a lot about the power of simulation for probabilistic models, and how modern computers, using what he calls his “Monte Carlo Engine”, allow us to get answers from complex models that previously would have been impossible, or at least very time consuming, to solve analytically. This was fresh in my mind when I read the following passage from chapter 8 of <em>The Education of a Speculator</em> about the well known gambler’s ruin problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A speculator with initial capital $C$ plays a game with a casino: he wins $£1$ each play with probability $P$ or loses $ £1$ with probability $Q=1-P$, the speculator stays in the game until his capital reaches $A$ or depreciates to $0$. It can be shown that in such a game, the speculators probability of ruin is, $$ \frac{(Q/P)^A-(Q/P)^C}{(Q/P)^A-1}$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very good example a problem which can be solved easily with the “Monte Carlo Engine”, or simulation in plainer language, but is actually quite difficult to solve analytically. In this post we’re going to derive the formula for the probability of ruin above analytically, and calculate the probability using simulation and hopefully along the way we’ll get a feel for the advantages and disadvantages of both methods<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="simulation">Simulation<a href="#simulation" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The idea behind simulation is really simple, to work out the probability that our gambler will be ruined, all we need to do is run a bunch of games in our imaginary casino, and work out the proportion of games in which the gambler loses, this then becomes our answer for the probability of ruin. We can think of each of these games as a sort of parallel universe, each is possible and distinct from the next, and taken as a whole they represent every possible situation our gambler could go through. Now you might be thinking, hang on, are there not an extremely large number (an infinite number even) of possible games? Could the gambler not keep on playing indefinitely if the correct combination of wins and losses arise such that the balance never goes higher than $A$, or lower than $0$? How are we going to simulate all of the games? The answer is that we aren’t, because this would take an infinitely long time, and so unfortunately we will never get the answer for the probability exactly correct, but we will be able to get pretty close in quite a short time. When we simulate things randomly, games that are more probable, and so contribute more to our final answer, are likely to occur even in a small number of simulations. Improbable games, such as very long games, are unlikely to occur in our simulation, this isn’t a problem though  because they naturally don’t contribute much to the final answer, so the error associated with not including them in our proportion will be small.</p>
<p>So how do we actually do the simulating? We just need to have some code that can produce randomly 1 (representing the gambler winning a play) with probability $P$ or 0 (representing the gambler losing a play) with
probability $Q$. Then we add or subtract $£1$ from the gamblers balance accordingly, we keep doing this until the balance reaches $A$, in which case we note down a win for the gambler, or $0$, where we note down a loss. All we have to do then to calculate the probability is tally up all the games the gambler lost, and then divide by the total number of games we simulated to get our estimate. The following Python code will do this for us:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> scipy.stats <span>import</span> bernoulli

        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>else</span>:
        <span># balance greater than A, note down a win</span>

        <span># tally up the wins</span>
        wins <span>+=</span> simulate_game(P, C, A) 
    
    <span># p(loss) = 1 - p(win)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> wins<span>/</span>N 

<span>print</span>(f<span>"Probabilty of ruin: {simulated_probability(0.6, 5, 10)}"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Note the Bernoulli function here just produces a 1 with probability $P$, and a zero with probability $Q=1-P$ like we needed. It really is that simple! Before we look at the properties of the answers our code gives, let’s solve the problem analytically as well.</p>
<h2 id="analytical-solution">Analytical Solution<a href="#analytical-solution" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><em>(This section is going to be a bit more maths heavy, so if that’s not your thing then feel free to skim/skip.)</em></p>
<p>Like a lot of problems in probability, at first glance it doesn’t look too bad. Unfortunately it’s kind of hard to know where to start because of the limitless number of different games that are possible. To get going we need to use a bit of a trick<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Let’s say the probability of winning the game when we start with capital $i$ is $P_i$ (taking $i$ to be an integer). The two possibilities for the first play of the game are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The gambler wins the first play with probability $p$ and ends up with capital $i+1$, the probability of going on to win the game from this position is then $P_{i+1}$.</li>
<li>The gambler loses the first play with probability $q=1-p$, and ends up with capital $i-1$, the probability of going on to win the game from this position is then $P_{i-1}$.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can then write $P_i$ in terms of these possible outcomes for the first play, as</p>
<p>$$ P_i = p \times P_{i+1} + q \times P_{i-1}. \tag{1}$$</p>
<p>We also know that $P_0=0$, if we have no money we have certainly lost, and $P_A=1$, if we reach capital $A$ we have certainly won. Equation 1 is called a difference equation, and it is like a discrete version of a differential equation. To solve it, we use use $p + q = 1$ to rewrite as follows,
$$(p+q)P_i =pP_{i+1} + q P_{i-1}$$
$$ \implies pP_{i+1}-pP_i=qP_{i}-qP_{i-1}$$
$$ \implies P_{i+1}-P_i=\frac{q}{p}(P_{i}-P_{i-1}) \tag{2}$$</p>
<p>Next write equation 2 as,<br>
$$ P_{j+1}-P_j = \frac{q}{p}(P_{j}-P_{j-1}) = \Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^2(P_{j-1}-P_{j-2}) = \dots= \Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^{j-1}(P_{1}-P_{0})=\Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^{j-1}P_{1}$$</p>
<p>for $j=1, \dots, A$, using $P_0=0$ for the final step. Next we want to use this to find a general formula for $P_i$, we are allowed to write
$$ P_i = P_i - P_0 = (P_i - P_{i-1}) + (P_{i-1} - P_{i-2}) + \dots + (P_{1} - P_{0}) $$</p>
<p>because for example the $+P_{i-1}$ cancels with the $-P_{i-1}$ and so contributes nothing overall. Subbing in equation 2 to each of the terms in brackets we get,
$$ P_i = P_1 \sum^{i-1}_{j=0}\Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^{j-1}$$</p>
<p>using the standard result for a finite sum of a geometric series, we get</p>
<p>$$P_i = P_1 \frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p) -1}$$</p>
<p>as long as $p\neq q$. If $p=q=1/2$ then we simply get  $P_i=P_1\sum^{i-1}_{j=0}(1)=iP_1$. Now we need to get rid of the $P_1$ which we can do by using $P_A=1$. In the case $p\neq q$ we have,</p>
<p>$$ P_A = 1 = P_1 \frac{(q/p)^A -1}{(q/p) -1}$$</p>
<p>so,
$$ P_1 =  \frac{(q/p) -1}{(q/p)^A -1}$$</p>
<p>which means
$$ P_i =  \frac{(q/p) -1}{(q/p)^A -1}\frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p) -1} =\frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p)^A -1}.$$</p>
<p>In the case $p=q=1/2$ we have $P_A=1=A P_1 \implies P_1 = 1/A$ so $P_i = i/A$. We now have an expression for the probability of a win so to covert our answer into the probability of ruin we just subtract it from 1 to get,</p>
<p>$$ P_i = 1 - \frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p)^A -1} = \frac{(q/p)^A - (q/p)^i}{(q/p)^A -1} \text{ and } P_i = 1 - \frac{i}{A} = \frac{A-i}{A} \tag{4}$$</p>
<p>in cases $p\neq q$ and $p=q=1/2$ respectively. We’ve finally made it, equation 4 is the same as the answer from <em>Education of a Speculator</em>!</p>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison<a href="#comparison" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>OK so now we have methods to calculate the probability of ruin both using simulation and analytically, let’s see how they compare. Below are plots of the probability of winning the game against the probability of winning a play $P$, for starting capital $C=£8$ and $C=£1$, using 500 simulated games. We can see that there is very good agreement between the two methods.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://magnusross.github.io/ruin_main.png" alt="How likely is ruin?">
    
      <figcaption>Plot of probability of ruin against probability of winning single play, for different $C$'s</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>We can get a better idea about the error introduced by using the simulated method from the following plot of error against number of simulated games, with error bars computed from 5 repeats. The gradient of the graph is about 0.5 and since the axis are log scale this corresponds to the relationship $E\propto\sqrt N$, where $E$ is error and $N$ is number of games. This is consistent with the standard result for the error of a Monte Carlo estimator.</p>

      <figcaption>Plot of error introduced by simulation methods against  number of simulated games.</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions<a href="#conclusions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I think the most important thing to consider when comparing the two solutions before we even think about errors, computation time etc, is simplicity. The code for the simulations took me less than 5 minutes to write. I spent about an hour trying to come up with an analytical solution with no luck, I then looked up the solution, and it took me quite a while longer to get my head round it. Even simple problems in probability can end up being analytically intractable, meaning no closed form solution can ever be found, let alone by me. For this reason Taleb is right to emphasize the power of the Monte Carlo engine, I hope this post has gone some way to illustrates it practical application.</p>

					February 2019 â€” I created this document from a collection of memories of a particular time in my life.  It is accurate to the best of my memory, but that does not mean it is complete.  Still, I think itâ€™s worth making public because there is almost no similar information on the intarwebs.
				</p>
				<p>
					If youâ€™re here to read about the TRS-80 Model 100 computer, you will have to slog through a lot of background information and personal anecdotes.  I didnâ€™t write this for clicks, or popularity, or recognition.  I wrote it for my own edification.  And I wrote the text of it on a TRS-80 Model 100.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are many TRS-80â€™s in the world. But this one is mine.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<a href="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/2000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg"><img src="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/1000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg" alt="My TRS-80 Model 100 computer on a table at Starbucks, as I wrote this story."></a>
				<figcaption>My TRS-80 Model 100 computer on a table at Starbucks, as I wrote this story.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The TRS-80 Model 100 is claimed by some to be the worldâ€™s first portable computer.  Whether that is true or not is hard to say.  Ninety percent of online journalism these days is nothing more than wannabe reporters summarizing other peopleâ€™s assumptions from web sites that know how to game a search engine.  But looking at old magazines of its era, the Model 100 was at least the first portable computer that wasnâ€™t a glorified calculator, or a suitcase so hefty that you could chock a tire with it to keep a Greyhound bus from rolling away.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document exists to show that the urban legend about TRS-80's being the devices that ushered journalism into the modern age is true. The Model 100 was a workhorse for a number of journalists, including a cadre of  roving correspondents for the Associated Press.  And also for me: a cub reporter for a radio station in a medium-sized, unremarkable city.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Background
			</h2>
			<p>
				This was a city not unlike dozens of other river towns across the United States.  For me, it wasnâ€™t my first experience as a broadcast journalist, but it was my first full-time, all-on-my-own job hundreds of miles from home.  More importantly, it was my first job with a computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The conventional wisdom is that the computer revolution came all at once, and from the top down; with big businesses investing in hardware and software to make their employees more productive.  But it was a two-pronged offense.
			</p>
			<p>
				While desktop computers were commonplace in large companies in large office towers in large cities, it took decades for computers to become everyday objects in 90% of America.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second prong came from that 90%.
			</p>
			<p>
				Across the country, computers were becoming regular fixtures in ordinary households.  Commodore 64â€™s, TI99/4Aâ€™s, Apple ][â€™s and the like opened up a new world of possibilities for Joe and Jane Lunchbucket, and their children.  Online services like CompuServe, QLink, The Source, and Delphi connected people to information and each other in ways that previous generations could only imagine.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was also unimaginable to many of the people running the companies for which these people worked.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even as late as the turn of the millennium, it was commonplace for someone to have a computer and online connection at home that was faster and better than what was available in their workplace.  Complaints about this upside-down situation put pressure on small and mid-sized companies to land computers on every desk.  Firms like Dell, Gateway 2000 and eMachines were happy to churn out millions of low-quality â€œbusiness" computers to fill this technology gap.

				Work before computers
			</h2>
			<p>
				I had a computer at home.  It was home-built, which wasnâ€™t unusual for the time.  But at work, it was all typewriters and pencils.  So many pencils.  I often wondered if it would make sense for all the reporters to put their pencils in a big communal bucket and have the interns sharpen them at the beginning of each work day.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to pencils, the primary tools of the reporterâ€™s trade were reporter notepads.  These are special spiral-bound pads of lined paper that are unusually narrow and unusually long.  They are the perfect size for stuffing into the inside pocket of a suit jacket or the outside pocket of a trench coat.  Each big story got its own pad, and youâ€™d build up a library of pads as an archive you could reference.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reporter pads were more than utilitarian.  They helped define the local journalism hierarchy.  Interns and reporters for alternative rags carried steno pads.  Real journalists had real reporter notepads from real journalism supply companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				But there was another level in the notepad caste system.  If you were lucky enough to be in the presence of a network correspondent, or someone working for one of the broadsheet institutions, you might be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their special reporter notepads.  These looked like the regular notepads that plebs like myself used.  But their companies were so professional, and so focused on making sure their people had everything they needed to do a good job that the notepads had the company logos stamped on the cover.  It was like bird watching for news nerds.  A big black CBS eye here. An academic maroon AP logo there.  A corporate blue UPI logo could be spied if you were very lucky.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as important as paper were the pencils a reporter carried.  Pens were right out.  If a pen dries up, explodes in your pocket, or otherwise refuses to cooperate, youâ€™re screwed.  A pencilâ€™s point might break, but you could pop into any random office building and ask the first secretary you came across to use her sharpener.  Plus, you always carried a fistful of spares.  In the worst case scenario, you could use a random sharp implement to expose enough lead to scratch with.  We all envisioned a story that was so important weâ€™d have to gnaw the wood off the end of a pencil just to make sure we didnâ€™t miss that career-making quote.

				<figcaption>Teletype paper was never meant to last more than a few hours or days.  This is from 1983.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In the radio newsroom, an intermittent tide of information came in on an Associated Press teletype machine.  It was something that looked like it belonged on the deck of a battleship spewing hot lead at airborne foes.  Two or three times a day someone would search through the ribbon of paper it spit onto the floor, rip each story from the spool, and file the stories into wire baskets labeled â€œLocal,â€� â€œState,â€� and â€œNational.â€�  There was also a â€œSaveâ€� bin way off to the side where people could collect copies of important news alerts and bulletins for posterity or their own personal collections.  International news went into the trash bins.  Thatâ€™s what we had the national network for.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thatâ€™s not to say that we didnâ€™t know what was going on.  At that level, all reporters are experts on national issues and foreign affairs.  Just ask them.  It was a game of one-upmanship that we all played to feed the fantasy that we might get a call from the network to join the big leagues in New York or D.C.  Which almost never happened.  No matter how much you contributed, you were more likely to squeeze into one of the few desirable slots at Voice of America than to be remembered by the network editors at Black Rock for more than six seconds after your voice left their air.
			</p>
			<p>
				But while we had pencils and we had paper and we had teletype machines, what we didnâ€™t have were computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				In school the boys didnâ€™t learn how to type.  That was for girls.  But since I had a computer at home, I knew my way around a keyboard.  You couldnâ€™t get a journalism degree without being able to bang out 40 words per minute on an IBM Selectric.  My scores were consistently above 80.  My J-school professors thought I was cheating.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I started my career, my home base was an AM/FM combo in the center of a small market.  Since I wasnâ€™t a full-time employee, I was free to work elsewhere.  And I did.  I would do a day at this station to fill in for someone who was sick, or a week at that station so someone could go on vacation.  At the time, it was very unusual for a local radio station to not have news at least once an hour.  Automation existed, but the spinning wheels of carts stopped when it was time for news.
			</p>
			<p>
				Doing news after school and on weekends helped pay for college.  To make that happen I got myself on the fill-in sheets of half the radio stations within 200 miles of where I lived.  Doing so allowed me to list more than a dozen commercial stations on my resume at a point in my career when my peers were lucky to get a DJ shift at a carrier current college station.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was bouncing between so many stations that one day I did, regrettably, announce that â€œKOJ news time is 7:05â€� on a station that wasnâ€™t KOJ.  The good people at K-104 never asked me back, which was a shame.  It was the first place I ever considered working full-time.  The facilities at K-104 were terrible.  But that was because management invested money in the employees instead of the physical plant, and everyone was paid far above what the competition paid.  The result was that everyone worked hard, and we were all handsomely rewarded.  But after my on-air mistake, I decided it was time to find one job, and stick to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				When it came time for a career change, I did what all radio people did: I consulted the help wanted listings in a strange industry newsletter that came in every day by fax.  Some station managers would tear the want ads off the end of the transmissions.  It was a very effective way to keep people from jumping ship in an era when information was still easy to control.  But if you were on the morning shift, you came in six hours before sales and management. That gave you an …</p></section></div>

  <p>small update (01/25/21): I posted this to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25883791">HN</a> and it ended up at the top of the front page for a couple of hours :O</p>

<hr>

<p>A few months ago I started working on a research project trying to pretrain my own, more efficient language model from scratch. I got access to a 128-core TPUv3 pod from the Tensorflow Reseach Cloud and used it to pretrain a $124$M parameter GPT-2 model to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model), and then pretrained an ALBERT-style GPT-2 (that I’m calling ALGPT2) language model with a factorized input embedding and layer-wise parameter sharing that would reduce the number of paramters in the model from $124$M to around $12$M.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ALGPT-2 doesn’t perform as well as GPT-2 (ALGPT-2 gets $31$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $21$ ppl for my pretrained GPT-2 model), but I’m writing this series of blog posts to go through everything I’ve learned over the last few months.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p>The main thing that I wanted to do from this sort-of “research project” that I was working on by myself this spring was to develop and train a more efficient version of the $124$M parameter version of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>. I wanted to pretrain the $1.5$B parameter version of GPT-2 but since I only got access to the TPU pod for a week, I had to choose a model that would train in time. A $100$k iteration training run takes about $20$ hours to run which gave me plenty of time to run multiple experiments. In contrast, following OpenAI’s training procedure exactly and training for the full $800$k iterations would take up almost an entire week and use up most of my quota.</p>

<p>I was able to almost replicate the $124$M parameter version of GPT-2 by pretraining it to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model used was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ perplexity (ppl) on the standard OpenWebText dataset compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model),</p>

<p>My idea of making a more efficient transformer didn’t really work out since my pretrained transformer ended up being about $20$ppl worse than an equivalent GPT-2 model, but I wanted to writeup what I learned over the two or three months that I was working on this anyway.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p>A little bit about myself: I’m an incoming software engineering student at the University of Waterloo and this post is supposed to be a writeup of a NLP research project that I was working on from around March to May of 2020 (right in the middle of the first Covid-19 lockdown of 2020, I’m currently writing this on July 15, 2020 while waiting for my Pix2PixHD model to train for a few hundred epochs on colab for a new project that I’m working on).</p>

<p>I was pretty lucky that I started learning NLP right before transformers exploded in popularity, I remember when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">word2vec</a> and LSTMs were SOTA on a lot of NLP tasks, and it has been really interesting to see how much the field of NLP has changed in just a few years, going from when LSTMs with only a a handful of layers and somewhere on the order of $512$ units were considered to be large networks and computationally expensive to train, to training LSTMs with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473">attention</a> layers on top, to the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer encoder/decoder networks</a>, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFIT</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMO</a>, then <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683">T5</a>, to just a few months ago with the explosion of new, more efficient replacements for self-attention like the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/">Sparse Transformer</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451">Reformer</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00743">Synthesizers</a>, and now <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, which IMO has the potential to really change the whole field of NLP.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago we trained shallow recurrent networks on datasets, then pretrained large transformer language models on large datasets and finetuned on task-specific datasets. Now the whole idea of just training a gigantic language model on a huge dataset, then conditioning the model in a form of few-shot learning by prepending a few examples of a certain task to an input feels like it can really make NLP models a lot more accessible and easier to productionize as well as making human-chatbot interactions a lot more realistic than they are today.</p>

<p>I’ve rambled on for long enough, lets get to the main topic of this post.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> is a transformer decoder.</p>

<p>The embedding layer at the root of the model maps a one-hot vector of a given token’s index (all the GPT-2 models use a vocabulary size of $50257$) to a $768$ dimensional vector (all GPT-2 numbers in this blog post will be for the $124$m parameter version of GPT-2).</p>

<p>The embedding matrix is followed by a stack of self-attention and feed-forward layers that each output a $768$ dimensional vector (keeping the number of outputs for each layer constant), which makes up the main part of the transformer.</p>

<p>The stack of self-attention layers is then followed by an output embedding (the weights of the input and output embeddings are tied to make training easier) that maps the $768$ dimensional vector that is the output of the last layer of the transformer to the same $50257$ dimensional vector that represents the probability of each token in the vocabulary being the next token in the sequence.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT-2</a> for a more in-depth look into GPT-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942">ALBERT</a> (A Lite BERT) is a paper that takes a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and identifies some ways in which to make it more efficient and reduce the number of parameters in the model in four major ways: a factorized embedding, layer-wise parameter sharing, a sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss, and removing dropout.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="factorized-embedding">
Factorized embedding</h3>

<hr>

<p>GPT-2’s embedding has a lot of parameters. It’s really just a matrix of dimensions $50257 \times 768$. That means that the input embedding alone uses up almost $50257 \times 768 = \space \sim 38,000,000$ parameters which is a pretty big chunk of the $128$M total parameters in the model.</p>

<p>The ALBERT authors propose a factorized embedding with an intermediate embedding size of $128$: one embedding of size $50257 \times 128$ and another embedding of size $128 \times 768$. By breaking up the large embedding matrix into two smaller matrices, the total number of parameters used in the embedding goes from about $38$M to about $6$M.</p>

<p>$50257 \times 128 = \sim 6,000,000$</p>

<p>$128 \times 768 = \sim 100,000$</p>

<p>The authors try different intermediate embedding sizes and settle on $128$ as a good tradeoff betweeen parameters and performance.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="layer-wise-parameter-sharing">
Layer-wise parameter sharing</h3>

<hr>

<p>In a normal transformer model, the transformer layers are created something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BERT</span><span>(</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n_layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>super</span><span>().</span><span>__init__</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>blocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>ModuleList</span><span>([</span><span>Block</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>n_layers</span><span>)])</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>

        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>ALBERT shares all parameters across the transformer layers something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ALBERT</span><span>(</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n_layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>super</span><span>().</span><span>__init__</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>

        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n_layers</span> <span>=</span> <span>n_layers</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>block</span> <span>=</span> <span>Block</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n_layers</span><span>:</span>
            <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>block</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By only defining one transformer block and looping around it <code>n_layers</code> times, ALBERT saves the GPU memory that would be used to store the parameters for all the layers.</p>

<p>Since we normally use $32$ bit floats to store parameters on the GPU, storing the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2 on the GPU will use up about $6$GB of the GPU’s memory — that’s a pretty big chunk of the $16$GB of memory that’s on a normal V100 GPU already being used up before taking into account the memory needed to store the model’s activations as well as any momentum parameters needed by the optimizer. In contrast, if you share parameters across all transformer layers in the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2, the resulting model will only have about $37$M parameters, the parameter-sharing version would only use up around $148$MB of GPU memory.</p>

<p>The authors try applying parameter sharing to BERT and see that it reduces performance but makes it easier to train larger and larger models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a machine learning framework like JAX, which by default unrolls and inlines loops when it’s compiling your code with XLA, the size of the unrolled and inlined loop would make the computation graph really large and take a long time to compile. This is why you’re recommended to use somehting like <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html"><code>lax.scan()</code></a> in these situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sentence-order-prediction-auxillary-loss">
Sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors add an auxillary loss to help training. Since language modelling is usually done autoregressively, I didn’t use this for my custom model.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="removing-dropout">
Removing dropout</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors remove all dropout from BERT and see that it significantly improves performance.</p>

<hr>

<p>That’s pretty much what my idea was: Take GPT-2, add a factorized embedding, share parameters across all transformer layers, remove dropout (I actually missed the part about ALBERT removing dropout until I was pretty far into my work, but I did run one or two runs without dropout to see how that works), and pretrain on a large dataset for a few hundred thousand iterations.</p>

<p>
To begin, we need to write a memory allocator, or as we will be calling it,
a malloc function. The simplest malloc implementations maintain a linked-list of
free blocks of memory that can be partitioned and given out as needed. When a
user requests a chunk of memory, a block of the right size is removed from the
free list and returned. If no blocks of the right size exist, either a block of
a larger size is partitioned into smaller blocks or more memory is requested
from the kernel. Freeing a chunk of memory simply adds it back to the free list.
</p>

<p>
Each chunk of memory in the free list begins with a header describing the
block. Our header will contain two fields, one indicating the size of the chunk
and the second pointing to the next free block of memory:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>header</span> {
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span>    <span>size</span>;
    <span>struct</span> <span>header</span>   *<span>next</span>;
} <span>header_t</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using headers that are embedded in the memory we allocate is really the only
sensible way of doing this, but it has the added benefit of automatically
word-aligning the chunks, which is important.
</p>

<p>
Because we will need to keep track of the blocks of memory currently in use
as well as the blocks that are not, we will have a used list in addition to a
free list. Items will be added to the used list when they are removed from the
free list, and vice-versa.
</p>

<p>
We are almost ready to complete the first step and write our malloc
implementation. Before we do that, we first need to understand how to request
memory from the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Dynamically allocated memory resides in the so-called heap, a section memory
between the stack and the BSS (uninitialized data segment - all your global
variables that have the default value of zero). The heap starts at a low address
bordering the BSS and ends at the program break, which resides somewhere between
the BSS and the stack. Attempting to access any memory between the stack and the
break will cause an access violation (unless you access within the amount the
stack can be extended by, but that's a whole separate conversation). In order to
obtain more memory from the kernel, we simply extend the break, thus allowing us
to access more memory. To do this, we call the Unix sbrk system call, which
extends the break by its argument and returns the address of the previous break
on success, thus giving the program more memory. On failure, sbrk returns -1
casted to a void pointer, which is a terrible convention that no one likes.
</p>

<p>
We can use this knowledge to create two functions: <code>morecore</code> and
<code>add_to_free_list</code>. In the case that we are out of blocks in the free list, we 
will call <code>morecore</code> to request more memory. Since requesting the kernel for more
memory is expensive, we will do it in page-size chunks. Knowing what a page is
is not important right now, but a terse explanation is that it is the smallest
unit of virtual memory that can be mapped to any particular location in physical
memory. We will use the function <code>add_to_free_list</code> to do exactly what it sounds
like.

<p>
Now that we have our two helper functions, writing our malloc function is
pretty straight forward. We simply scan the free list and use the first block
that is at least as big as the chunk we're trying to find. Because we use the 
first block we find instead of trying to find a "better" block, this algorithm
is known as first fit.
</p>

<p>
A quick note to clarify: the size field in the header struct is measured in
header-sized blocks, and not bytes.

<p>
Although this code isn't going to win any awards for low fragmentation, it'll
work. And if it works, that means we can finally get to the fun part - the
garbage collection!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM. JavaFX is a modern GUI
toolkit for the JVM. You could use JavaFX directly with Clojure's Java interop,
but Cljfx provides a declarative and functional wrapper for JavaFX. Instead of
building yet another calculator, we're going to use Cljfx to build a GUI for
generating a tone.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goober99/lisp-gui-examples/master/screenshots/cljfx.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>You'll need Clojure installed. We also need a way to pull the Cljfx dependency
into our app. It seems <a target="_blank" href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">deps.edn</a>
would be the easiest way to accomplish this for a short tutorial example such
as this, but I develop on Debian and found that the new <a target="_blank" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=891141">command line
tools</a> for Clojure
that enable this haven't made it into Debian yet. I could install Clojure from
the Clojure website, but the point of this tutorial is to be easy to follow by
someone not familiar with Clojure. It's a lot easier to direct a person to <code>apt
install clojure</code> (or whatever package manager your preferred distro uses). This
tutorial is a living document maintained on GitHub along with the example code.
Whenever the Clojure command line tools become available on Debian, it's
possible I'll revisit this tutorial and update it.</p>
<p>The Clojure build tool Leiningen is capable of managing dependencies (and a
whole lot more). There is also a build tool for Clojure called Boot. I found
more plentiful tutorials and beginner resources for Leiningen, plus Leiningen
is available as a Debian package, so for this tutorial, Leiningen it is.
Install Clojure and Leiningen from your distro's repo. Debian also has an
OpenJFX package, but Leiningen was able to pull OpenJFX in as a dependency of
Cljfx. The version pulled in by Leiningen is probably more up to date than
whatever might be sitting in your distro's repos.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a Leiningen project directory. This can be
accomplished with <code>lein new app bleep</code>, but that created a directory full of
subdirectories and files that were unnecessary for a short little example like
this. I created the directory structure (<code>mkdir -p cljfx/src/bleep</code>) and
created <code>cljfx/project.clj</code> and <code>cljfx/src/bleep/core.clj</code> with the minimum
needed to create a window with Cljfx.</p>
<p><code>project.clj</code></p>
<pre><code>(defproject bleep "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.0"]
                 [cljfx "1.7.12"]
                 [com.jsyn/jsyn "20170815"]]
  :main bleep.core)
</code></pre>
<p><code>core.clj</code></p>
<pre><code>(ns bleep.core
  (:gen-class)
  (:require [cljfx.api :as fx])
  (:import [javafx.application Platform]
           [com.jsyn JSyn]
           [com.jsyn.unitgen LineOut SineOscillator]))

(defn hello-world [&amp; args]
  {:fx/type :label
   :text "Hello, World!"})

(defn root [&amp; args]
  {:fx/type :stage
   :showing true
   :title "Bleep"
   :scene {:fx/type :scene
           :root {:fx/type :v-box
                  :padding 25
                  :spacing 40
                  :children [{:fx/type hello-world}]}}})

(def renderer
  (fx/create-renderer))

(defn -main [&amp; args]
  (Platform/setImplicitExit true)
  (renderer {:fx/type root}))
</code></pre>
<p>The project file (<code>project.clj</code>) is the file that tells Leiningen about your
project (such as its dependencies). Typically with Leiningen, your code will
live in the <code>src</code> subdirectory in a subdirectory that matches the top-level
namespace of your project. All this can be changed with your <code>project.clj</code>, but
we'll be sticking to convention for this example. In this subdirectory is
<code>core.clj</code>.</p>
<p>Begin the file with a namespace declaration. The namespace should have a
<code>(:gen-class)</code> declaration in the <code>ns</code> form at the top for Leiningen. Since
we'll be using Cljfx to create our GUI, we need to <code>require</code> it. We'll mostly
be using JavaFX via Cljfx, but you can also access JavaFX classes directly.
Let's <code>import</code> (a way to get Java code into Clojure) the JavaFX Platform class.
We'll also import the Java JSyn library for use later in generating the tone.</p>
<p>Leiningen needs a <code>-main</code> function (note the leading dash is part of the
function name). This is the function that will get called when you run your app
with Leiningen or when you compile it to a standalone JAR. We use the
<code>setImplicitExit</code> method from the JavaFX Platform class to make sure the JavaFX
runtime shuts down when the window is closed.</p>
<p>Cljfx is declarative instead of imperative or object oriented like many GUI
libraries. You describe the layout with a map of key-value pairs instead of
creating controls with methods or functions. The <code>:fx/type</code> key has a value of
a kebab-cased keyword derived from a JavaFX class name. The other keys of the
map are the kebab-cased properties of that class. You can refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX
documentation</a> for a list of classes and their properties.
JavaFX is well documented and has a large number of controls available.</p>
<p>JavaFX defines the user interface by means of a stage and a scene. The stage is
the top-level JavaFX container (the window). The scene is the container for all
content. To add a JavaFX class to the map, you convert the class name to
kebab-case. For example, JavaFX has a <code>VBox</code> pane used to lay out controls
vertically. This would be written <code>:v-box</code> in the Cljfx map. The <code>VBox</code> class
has a <code>padding</code> property. We can set this to 25 by adding a <code>:padding</code> key to
the map with a value of 25.</p>
<p>Cljfx provides a renderer function created with <code>fx/create-renderer</code> that you
pass the map describing your user interface to. You can call <code>renderer</code>
multiple times to dynamically change the GUI. Now let's replace the Hello World
label with a slider:</p>
<pre><code>(defn frequency-slider [{:keys [frequency]}]
  {:fx/type :slider
   :min 20
   :max 20000
   :value frequency})
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of placing the definition of your entire UI into one big map, you can
compose the UI from reusable functions. This also makes your code more
readable, because you don't have a deeply nested map. These functions can be
used just like any other JavaFX class. The <code>:fx/type</code> key is the function name,
and the other keys of the map are the arguments to the function. We can add the
<code>frequency-slider</code> we created above to the <code>:children</code> vector of the <code>:v-box</code>
in the <code>root</code> map like this:</p>
<pre><code>[{:fx/type frequency-slider
  :frequency 440}]
</code></pre>
<p>The range of frequencies audible by humans is typically between 20 Hz and 20
KHz (we lose the ability to hear some of those higher frequencies as we age).
The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard">musical note A above middle
C</a>) is 440 Hz. Since A4
serves as a general tuning standard, it seems like a sensible default, but if
you run the above with <code>lein run</code>, this is what you'll see:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goober99/lisp-gui-examples/master/screenshots/cljfx-linearslider.png" alt="Slider"></p>
<p>The scale of 20 to 20,000 is so large that 440 doesn't appear to move the
slider at all. Ideally, 440 would fall about the middle of the slider. To
achieve this, let's use a logarithmic scale.</p>
<p>I found a <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/846221/logarithmic-slider/846249#846249">Stack Overflow
answer</a>
on how to map a slider to a logarithmic scale. The code given in the answer is
JavaScript, but it was easy enough to port to Clojure.</p>
<pre><code>; Scale used by slider
(def min-position 0)
(def max-position 2000)
; Range of frequencies
(def min-frequency 20)
(def max-frequency 20000)

; Logarithmic scale for frequency (so middle A [440] falls about in the middle)
; Adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/846221/logarithmic-slider

(def min-freq (Math/log min-frequency))
(def max-freq (Math/log max-frequency))
(def frequency-scale (/ (- max-freq min-freq) (- max-position min-position)))
; Convert slider position to frequency
(defn position-&gt;frequency [position]
  (int (Math/round (Math/exp (+ min-freq (* frequency-scale (- position min-position)))))))
; Convert frequency to slider position
(defn frequency-&gt;position [freq]
  (int (Math/round (/ (- (Math/log freq) min-freq) (+ frequency-scale min-position)))))
</code></pre>
<p>I added some global parameters to the top of the script. I came up with the
range of 0-2,000 by trial and error. It seemed to strike the best balance
between each step of the slider making a noticeable change to the frequency
while still allowing the user to narrow in on a specific frequency with just
the slider.</p>
<p>Then we create two functions: one that takes the position on the slider and
returns the frequency (<code>position-&gt;frequency</code>) and another that takes a
frequency and returns the position on the slider (<code>frequency-position</code>). Now
let's set the initial position of our slider with the <code>frequency-&gt;position</code>
function:</p>
<pre><code>(defn frequency-slider [{:keys [frequency]}]
  {:fx/type :slider
   :min min-position
   :max max-position
   :value (frequency-&gt;position frequency)})
</code></pre>
<p>Underneath the slider is a text field showing the current frequency.</p>
<pre><code>(defn frequency-controls [{:keys [frequency]}]
  {:fx/type :h-box
   :alignment :center
   :spacing 20
   :children [{:fx/type :h-box
               :alignment :center
               :spacing 5
               :children [{:fx/type :text-field
                           :text (str frequency)}
                          {:fx/type :label
                           :text "Hz"}]}]})
</code></pre>
<p>Add this to the <code>:children</code> vector of the <code>:v-box</code> in the <code>root</code> map:</p>
<pre><code>[{:fx/type frequency-slider
  :frequency frequency}
 {:fx/type frequency-controls
  :frequency frequency}]
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we are starting to have a nice looking interface, but it doesn't
do anything. If you slide the slider, nothing happens. If your experience is
mostly with object-oriented GUI libraries, the way Cljfx does things will be a
little unfamiliar. If you've used the JavaScript library React, it employs a
similar model. Global state is stored in an atom. When you update that atom,
all the relevant controls are updated accordingly.</p>
<pre><code>; Cljfx global state
(def *state
  (atom {:frequency 440}))
</code></pre>
<p>Add middleware to the <code>renderer</code> that maps incoming data from the global state
atom to the component description to be rendered:</p>
<pre><code>(def renderer
  (fx/create-renderer
    :middleware (fx/wrap-map-desc assoc :fx/type root)))
</code></pre>
<p>Then modify <code>-main</code> to use <code>fx/mount-renderer</code> instead of calling <code>renderer</code>
directly. This will watch the global state atom for changes and rerender the
GUI accordingly.</p>
<pre><code>(defn -main [&amp; args]
  (Platform/setImplicitExit true)
  (fx/mount-renderer *state renderer))
</code></pre>
<p>In most of the other examples, I would now write a function for each control
that updates the …</p></div></div>

    </span></p><p>For the purposes of this workflow, I decided to leave the tasks in the Inbox. This reduces the need to add a Project to each item. However, if you are a regular Todoist user you will likely want to use a specific Project so that you can use your Inbox for non-time tracking items. You could either do this via a keyboard shortcut when you add activities or by manually moving all tasks to a specific project in batches. Here’s my example Inbox:</p><p><span>

      </picture>
    </span></p><p>Now that the items are in Todoist, I created a script to export them into a specific CSV format that will make it easy to upload and analyze in Google Sheets. Once the script is run, you can upload the CSV file in a Google Sheet via “File &gt; Import &gt; Upload”. Here’s an example of what this could look like:</p><p><span>

      </picture>
    </span></p><p>With the data in Sheets, you can slice, dice, and display the data to your heart’s desire using pivot tables, charts, and whatever other Sheets trickery you know. Here’s an example of a pivot table that shows an example of time spent by activity over the past week. Pivot tables make it easy to quickly change the time horizon via a dropdown menu.

There is no better feeling (especially as a bad developer) than bringing to life something that was just an idea a couple hours ago. While there are probably better solutions out there, I think this solution strikes a good balance of being easy to use and highly customizable, a combination that seems rare based on all the replies.

<p><img src="https://www.codenotary.com/images/blog/mascotfree.png" width="350"></p><p>A huge percentage of the world’s most valuable data is processed on IBM mainframes. Mainframes are designed with reliability and security in mind since day one. Many libraries on mainframes should only be changed through a trusted pipeline. Tampering central and highly critical programs on a mainframe infrastructure of an organization would be a strike at the heart. Attacks like <a href="https://www.codenotary.com/blog/solarwinds-sunburst/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sunburst</a> showed that cyber-criminals act opportunistic and are able to create huge damage by tampering software. Hackers won't stop at system frontiers but instead, look for a weak spot. Sometimes even mainframes get in their focus although known for being a highly secured platform. One example for that has been the <a href="https://badcyber.com/a-history-of-a-hacking/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Logica-Nordea mainframe hack</a>. Next to cyber-security threats orchestrated by state-funded hacker organizations is the possibility of a malicious insider attack by actors like employees. Although this scenario is not very common the consequences would be equally devastating.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codenotary.com/technologies/immudb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Immudb</a> is an open-source, lightweight, high-speed immutable database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. It can run on almost every architecture and you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of sensitive data, for example, debit/credit card transactions or datasets and it's members. Traditional DB transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised. As such, immudb provides unparalleled insights retroactively of changes to your sensitive data, even if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using cryptographic data structures internally.</p>
<h2 id="immudb-architecture-on-ibm-z">Immudb architecture on IBM Z</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.codenotary.com/images/blog/immudb-mainframe.jpg" width="450">
Immudb is lightweight and at the same time delivering unprecedented performance. Every Hardware-Architecture that is supported by golang will be able to run immudb. S390X is the Architecture of IBM Z and it is fully supported. The immudb server should run in a different and protected environment. LPAR on IBM Z is EAL5 certified therefore offering a high level of protection. Of course, immudb is also able to run next to a mainframe on distributed systems.
</p><p>We propose running immudb on Linux on Z on a different LPAR communicating with z/OS over in-memory HiperSockets reducing overhead and latency. <a href="https://github.com/codenotary/immugw" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Immugw</a> is a middleware that provides a REST-API for immudb. The API can be consumed by z/OS through various programming languages and scripts. Take a look at rocket software's <a href="https://www.rocketsoftware.com/zos-open-source" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open source tools for z/OS</a> to expand your scope with tools like <a href="https://www.rocketsoftware.com/platforms/ibm-z/curl-for-zos" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cURL</a>. </p>
<p>Immudb and immugw can be deployed on Linux on Z without a hassle. Git clone the repositories and install golang. Switch to the repositories directory and type: make all. Start up ./immudb and ./immugw. Done.</p>
<h2 id="application-design">Application design</h2>
<p>It is recommended to use IBM Z's extensive crypto-hardware support (for example for hash functions) like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.zsecurity.api.80.doc/com.ibm.crypto.hdwrCCA/com/ibm/crypto/hdwrCCA/provider/IBMJCECCA.html#IBMJCECCA--" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBMJCECCA</a>. One challenge of running highly critical systems is to ensure that no one tampered production software. Let’s start with an basic example, a developer pushed code into a protected library. Now he wants to notarize that member using immudb. He can do so by using a batch job that has the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: pull the original signing program or script and verify it</li>
<li>Step 2: generate checksum of his source code and set it in immudb</li>
</ul>
<p>Now a build-job would look almost the same. First, the source will be verified. With immudb it is also possible to look up the history. An object with an unclear history wouldn't be able to get into production. The program can then be build from the trusted source and the resulting load module has to be notarized. </p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>In this blog we are showing how to communicate with immudb/immugw by using java. Java is a good candidate because it works in every environment even in DB2 as a stored procedure. It is possible to backup data of DB2 tables on change. More about that later.</p>
<p>Our Java programm can be run as step in JCL Jobs (for example: build jobs or jobs that are altering). The target dataset can be set as variable in JCL and passed to the java program.</p>
<div><pre><code>//JAVAJVM  EXEC PGM=JVMLDM&amp;VERSION,REGION=&amp;REGSIZE,

<p>The code snippet below is showing a clean way of doing HTTP-API calls with only using HttpURLConnection. That way you will not face missing dependencies in different runtime locations. The function postRequest needs to be provided with the URL of immugw and a JSON-string. The JSON-string will be converted to bytes and posted. The response is being returned.</p>

<h3 id="getting-checksums-of-datasets-on-change">Getting checksums of datasets on change</h3>
<p>With z/OS it is possible to detect changes of datasets. There are two ways of doing that. Either write a started task and listen to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.ieac100/ieac1-smf-inmem.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SMF realtime api</a> (SMF15) or monitor a module that gets loaded by CLOSE via CSVEXIT. Intercepting the CLOSE SVC is a delicate job but possible. Then use the name of the changed dataset create a hash and set it in immudb. That way you can track changes of datasets immutably and tamperproof.</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-ebcdic-and-ascii-conversion-challenges">Overcoming EBCDIC and ASCII conversion challenges</h3>
<p>Objects will change their checksum when they are converted from EBCDIC to ASCII and the other way around. Many code signing solutions will lose track of the object. Immudb is capable of storing JSON-Objects as value. Metadata can be added to an object referencing at the ASCII/EBCDIC checksum of the object. </p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"ascii.checksum"</span> <span>:</span> <span>"d7e4d83a94d161837aa4038cbaf9708b2bb2d91675a20493a982ce4b17d8012e"</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="immutability-for-db2">Immutability for DB2</h2>
<p>A possible cyber-attack could focus on databases. Cybercriminals could gain access to databases by using SQL injections. They then use their access levels to encrypt whatever they get their hands on. Immudb can keep up with the fastest databases and back up their data. Read more about that in our <a href="https://www.codenotary.com/blog/immutability-vs-ransomware" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">randomware</a> blog.</p>
<p>Triggers in DB2 will notify about changes of tables. Set an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_12.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_sql_altertriggeradvanced.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alter trigger</a> and execute a stored procedure to store the new data of the table in immudb. Push the java code to DB2 and create the stored procedure. After that, it is callable by SQL. When the trigger is called, set the parameters and call javaproc. Use the OUT STATUS variable to report the HTTP-Code.</p>
<div><pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE JAVAPROC (IN TABLE CHAR(99),
                           IN COLUMN CHAR(99),

				<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I made a map displaying weather and traffic road conditions for Spain that is easier to use, nicer and faster than the official Spanish Government map. <br>
As usual (<a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/where-the-f-can-i-park/">1</a>, <a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/the-sorry-state-of-transparency-in-spain-where-is-my-certificate/">2</a>), I keep being disappointed with the Spanish Government Open Data policies.</p>

<p>You can check out the map <a href="http://dgt.manugarri.com/">here</a>. I also shared the required code on <a href="https://github.com/manugarri/dgt_map">Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="anintroductionandabitofranting">An introduction, and a bit of ranting.</h2>

<p>It was January 2021, and I was spending the holidays with my family in my awesome hometown of <a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/plotting-100k-tweets-from-my-home-town/">Murcia, Spain</a>.</p>

<p>For you future travelers, this year was the COVID pandemic year, so things were a bit weird and traveling wasnt as easy as you whipersnappers are used to. Me and my family (two kids at the moment of writing this) would be driving back from Murcia to Lisbon, Portugal where I reside.</p>

<p>Additionally, this year saw record breaking snowstorms in Spain thanks to (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55612955">Storm Filomena</a>).</p>

<p>These two reasons meant that going back home to Lisbon from my hometown required planning, since there was a real risk of getting stuck in the car with 2 crying babies (omg Im shivering just thinking about it).</p>

<p>So a couple days before the travel day, I checked online to see any information on the roads.</p>

<p>The best resource I could find (<strong>and if there is a better resource, the fact that it cant be easily found defeats its purpose</strong>) was the official Spain Traffic Authority (DGT, <em>Direccion General de Trafico</em>) Map. You can check it <a href="http://infocar.dgt.es/etraffic/">here</a></p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of how the map looks like: <br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wAbVIe9.png" alt="ugh"></p>

<p>There are a few things that trigger me when I see this map:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Slow</em>, this map seems to be an embedded map from an internal GIS system or something, plus it has a ton of features that makes it pretty slow.</li>
<li><em>Confusing</em> no legend regarding event types</li>
<li><em>Overall Ugliness</em>, you can tell icons just jam up next to each other, and they are mostly gray, with a tiny hint of color indicating the road circulation level.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the worst thing of all, <em>there is no navigation search!</em>.  This means the official traffic map forces you to know the actual code of the road you are planning to drive on in order to see if there are any weather events affecting the road's state. <strong>Im not a truck driver! I don't know these names!</strong></p>

<p>What I needed at that uncertain time was to be able <strong>to find out if driving from point A to Point B would go through any road that was blocked for any reason</strong>. The only way to do so with the official map was to search in google maps for driving directions and then check the DGT map for any road event.</p>

<h2 id="buildingabettermap">Building a better map</h2>

<p>Here is my version (<a href="http://dgt.manugarri.com/">link</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2uMnyqi.png" alt="tadaa!"></p>

<p>You may notice a few differences between my map and DGT map:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>fast</em>, my map consist of a simple map, so the only loading consists of the map tiles themselves</li>
<li><em>easy to read</em> , my map has an actual legend that indicates what each icon means. This is Dataviz 101</li>
<li><em>pretty</em>, this is more of a personal opinion, but using brighter colors for the event icons makes the map more appealing, and visual appeal increases user engagement. </li>
</ul>

<p>And most important of all, <strong>you can get see the road conditions for the trip you are planning!</strong>. Just type the origin and destination and click the button, and the map will plot the route.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PHk7NjD.png" alt="it aint hard"></p>

<h2 id="applicationdetails">Application Details</h2>

<p>You can see the code powering the map on <a href="https://github.com/manugarri/dgt_map">Github</a>.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to implement the map as a 100% frontend solution, since that would keep the site from exploding if it becomes too popular,  but due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> limitations I had to implement a simple backend to fetch the DGT road condition events.</p>

<p>The backend app is a <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> web application in charge of rendering the index page, fetching the road condition events, and geocoding the navigation search terms. It is the first time I use FastAPI, and its super easy to use and faster than other similar microframeworks (like Flask)</p>

<p>The map itself is a simple Leaflet map with overlaid events, when the user loads the map, an HTTP GET request fetches the official DGT road conditions data from <a href="http://infocar.dgt.es/etraffic/BuscarElementos?latNS=44&amp;longNS=5&amp;latSW=27&amp;longSW=-19&amp;zoom=6&amp;accion=getElementos&amp;Camaras=true&amp;SensoresTrafico=true&amp;SensoresMeteorologico=true&amp;Paneles=true&amp;Radares=true&amp;IncidenciasRETENCION=true&amp;IncidenciasOBRAS=false&amp;IncidenciasMETEOROLOGICA=true&amp;IncidenciasPUERTOS=true&amp;IncidenciasOTROS=true&amp;IncidenciasEVENTOS=true&amp;IncidenciasRESTRICCIONES=true&amp;niveles=true&amp;caracter=acontecimiento">this url</a> , the same one the official map uses (you can check using the developer network tools on your browser). </p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">httpx</a> to perform the GET request, for no reason besides testing it, its supposed to be the next Requests.</p>

<p>Leaflet provides basic icons out of the box, but since I wanted to display a few different event types, I used erikflower's awesome <a href="https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/">Weather icons</a>. These icons not only are beautiful (particularly compared to DGT's <a href="http://infocar.dgt.es/etraffic/img/iconosIncitar/">ugly ones</a>), but also render very fast since they are not bitmaps.</p>

<p>I found it a bit complicated how to add custom icons, but <a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/making-a-simple-better-road-conditions-map-for-spain/(https://www.geoapify.com/create-custom-map-marker-icon)">this doc</a> explains it nicely.</p>

<p>Finally, I used <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/">OpenRouteService</a> as a geocoding package to translate the Navigation search terms into geocoordinates. It doesnt work as well as Google Maps, but its open source and Google Maps has turned a bit evil in recent times. OpenRouteService has a nice <a href="https://openrouteservice-py.readthedocs.io/">python package</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Leaflet keeps getting better and better!, now its super easy to add custom tile providers. there are even a ton of tile providers now thanks to the awesome <a href="https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers">leaflet-providers</a> project. For example, here is how the map looks like with a different tile provider (Stadia)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lLif5Ff.png" alt="stadia"></p>

<ol>
<li>Again and again, I come up with a nice frontend project idea that I have to implement with a backend just because of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a>. There should be a way to disable CORS for well spirited applications. Maybe prompting the user to disable CORS for a site?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you only learn one technical term from labor economics, make it "chickenization" – Christopher Leonard's term for the way that the Big Three poultry processors have structured the chicken-farming industry (I learned it from Zephyr Teachout).</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up</a></p>
<p>Here's chickenization: you're a chicken farmer. There is only one company that can buy your birds, thanks to market concentration. They tell you how to design and maintain your coop. They sell you the chicks. They tell you which feed to use, how much and when.</p>
<p>They tell you when the lights go on and when they go off. They tell you how which vet to use, and which medicines they can use. They bind you to secrecy through nondisclosure and strip you of the right to sue through arbitration.</p>
<p>They experiment on you. Your barn is filled with sensors that they monitor, and they tell you to vary feed, lighting, medicine and other variables to see if your birds get bigger. They are the only buyer in your region, so they know how each farmer's birds are thriving.</p>
<p>But if the "independent" farmers ever tried to compare notes, they'd be violating their nondisclosure agreements and could be sued. Farmers who complain to regulators are barred from the market.</p>
<p>Once your birds are grown, you bring them to the processor, who exploits their information asymmetry to figure out how to pay you JUST ENOUGH to go back to things, but not enough to get ahead. Since chickenization, poultry farmers have faced a wave of suicides.</p>
<p>Once you know about chickenization, you see it everywhere: crop farmers are chickenized by seed companies, and Uber drivers are chickenized by their apps.</p>
<p>The contours of chickenization are impossible to miss: it's a shifting of all the risk from the employer's side of the balance sheet to the workers', using the fiction of independent contractorship, the data-gathering capabilities of digital work, and monopolies.</p>
<p>Today, I learned about the worst chickenization scheme I've ever encountered: a giant, global company that has chickenized a vast workforce, but maintains total secrecy, even as it services massive blue-chip companies from Airbnb to Disney.</p>
<p>That company is Arise, and Propublica and Planet Money just blew the roof off its ghastly charnel house of a chicken farm by, as Ken Armstrong, Justin Elliott and Ariana Tobin reported out leaks, arbitration reports, and whistleblower accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-customer-service-reps-for-disney-and-airbnb-who-have-to-pay-to-talk-to-you#1001065">https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-customer-service-reps-for-disney-and-airbnb-who-have-to-pay-to-talk-to-you#1001065</a></p>
<p>Here's chickenization, Arise style: the company is a outsource phone support system. Workers have to pay to work for Arise (they're "independent contractors"): buy a dedicated PC, internet connection and other equipment.</p>
<p>They have to do weeks of unpaid "training" just to get started, and then they have to pay more to get specific training for every one of Arise's giant corporate clients, from AT&amp;T to Carnival Cruises to Comcast to Disney to Airbnb to Intuit to Barnes and Noble to Ebay.</p>
<p>After passing random, invasive, in-home inspections, after shelling out thousands of dollars and doing weeks – if not months – of unpaid training, they are finally eligible to sign up for shifts.</p>
<p>These shifts come in 30 minute slices, widely spaced, and turning them down gets you blacklisted. It's impossible to hold down another job while you're an Arise chicken-farmer.</p>
<p>But you don't get paid for 30-minute shifts. You just get paid for the time that you're talking to customers.</p>
<p>The whole time you talk to a customer, an algorithm is ready to penalize you: i.e., if it takes too long to deal with queries, or if there're too many pauses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the client's outsource managers randomly (or not-randomly) listen in on your calls, and they can penalize you too.</p>
<p>The main penalty is being "deskilled" – barred from working for that client, after paying (in cash and time) to get trained to be their phone rep.</p>
<p>Workers are barred from hanging up on abusive customers. Women report high levels of sexual harassment, which they have to patiently endure, because they risk getting fired if they hang up on their abusers.</p>
<p>And all workers are expected to tolerate unlimited abuse from callers. 64% of Arise's workers are people of color. 89% of them are women. Arise's recruiting ads target Black women in particular.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a way to get ahead in Arise: recruit other workers. Because, in addition to everything else, it's a pyramid scheme, and the business is riddled with people who've been previously convicted of wire fraud.</p>
<p>Nearly every person in the Arise structure is chickenized:. The following jobs are all performed by "independent contractors":</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Support Professionals</li>
<li>Quality Assurance Performance Facilitators</li>
<li>Chat Performance Facilitators</li>
<li>Escalation Performance Facilitators</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only do you have to pay to work for Arise – you have to pay (a "contract termination fee") to stop working for them.</p>
<p>Arise binds workers to arbitration, meaning they can't sue. The right of workers to join class actions in spite of arbitration waivers went to the Supreme Court in '18, where the illegitimate justice Neal Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion, ruling against workers.</p>
<p>Arise honors Juneteenth with a day off for all employees. But all those Black women it has chickenized are independent businesses and are still expected to show up for work.</p>
<p>Arise's founder is Richard Cherry, a Canadian "serial entrepreneur" who started off writing scammy get-rich-quick and lose-weight-quick books before moving to Florida and getting heavily involved with the Home Shopping Network.</p>
<p>Today, the company is a division of a giant private equity fund, Warburg Pincus.</p>

<p>One of my all-time favorite artists is London's Dan Hillier, who has made a career out of finding public domain engravings, scanning and cleaning them up, and then making spooky, haunting, grotesque and infinitely lovely collages out of them.</p>
<p>Hillier has just launched two new projects: "Six Women" and "Six Men," a pair of "box sets" of  previously released and sold out work in fresh editions as giclee prints augmented by handpainted, very fine 24K gold leaf, sold as framed sets.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hilliersixwomen.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hilliersixwomen.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><br>

<p>The sets are limited editions, framed in antique-black finish beech by Dylan Shipton Frames, and the prints float in behind anti-UV glass. You can see them in person at Hillier's (distanced/ventimated) Walthamstow gallery or buy them online:</p>

<p>Chekhov exhorted writers not to put a gun onstage unless a character is going to fire it. But this advice has a corollary for audiences: "If there's a pistol on the mantelpiece in Act I, it'll go off by Act III."</p>
<p>If only Apple had paid attention.</p>
<p>Apple wasn't the first company to use DRM to prevent users from installing software on devices without its approval (game consoles did this for years), but it WAS the first company to popularize the model for general purpose devices.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I predicted that once Apple gave itself the power to decide which software you were allowed to use, governments would start ordering it to prevent you from using software they didn't like.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-thi.html">https://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-thi.html</a></p>
<p>Three years ago, Apple kicked aa working VPNs out of the Chinese App Store, to so that the Chinese state – which was in the midst of rounding up <em>one million</em> Uyghurs and putting them in concentration camps – could spy on its population more effectively</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc">https://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc</a></p>
<p>Now, Apple's purged its Chinese App Store of RSS readers, which allow Apple customers in China to evade state censorship and surveillance, which have been used in lethal ways, including targeting dissidents for organ-harvesting.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/</a></p>
<p>This is a really stark example of the failure of the "feudal security" model we have evolved as states have both failed to create protections for users (e.g. a US federal privacy law with a private right of action) and to prevent monopolization of tech.</p>
<p>Deprived of the legal tools to defend ourselves with, we are forced to seek protection from feudal seigneurs (e.g. tech companies) and hope that their business interests align with our human rights interests.</p>
<p>So you can use Chrome, which is about to start blocking third-party cookies, meaning that other people can't track you – but Google can. Google doesn't want to protect your privacy – it wants to get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Google will use this power to incidentally protect your privacy by blocking some of the worst online surveillance, but if you're worried about Google itself (or one of its trusted parties) abusing your data, Chrome won't help you.</p>
<p>Likewise, Apple makes a big (and deserved) deal out of its privacy orientation, but that privacy is in service to a marketing message: "Apple is the pro-privacy alternative." Apple cares about selling devices, and privacy is a means to that end.</p>
<p>Apple's decision to both manufacture and sell devices in China, combined with its power to choose which apps you can use, all but guaranteed that it would be deputized to aid in mass roundups for concentration camps and organ harvesting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the policies that Apple relies on to prevent companies creating third-party app stores – policies like DMCA 1201, the copyright law that bans breaking Apple DRM – are defended by an infinite warchest funded by all …</p></div></article></div>

    <p>Teams, especially at growth companies, often have a pattern of taking two steps forward and one step back. Let’s explore how teams often unknowingly slip after growing and let’s explore ways to prevent that from happening. Only forward steps!</p>

<h2 id="this-happens-a-lot---the-setup">This Happens A Lot - The Setup</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about my favorite pretend team, The Acme Widget Builders. It’s a cross-functional team with a product manager, an engineering manager, and a number of engineers. The team is operating very well and is growing with the company. Eventually the Original Product Manager has to hire another PM to manage the team, so the Original Product Manager can manage a larger group of teams.</p>

<p>About 6 months later the team starts to suffer a string of quality issues. Nobody really knows why this is happening, but it’s frustrating. The team starts to focus much more heavily on QA and gets back on the righteous path over time. However, a concern remains - what happened?</p>

<h2 id="this-happens-a-lot---the-diagnosis">This Happens A Lot - The Diagnosis</h2>

<p>After doing some soul searching about what the heck happened, you realize that the Original Product Owner was a Widget Whiz. They knew every single thing about the Acme Widgets, and, in fact, they were catching a lot of bugs when reviewing features-to-be-launched at the UAT phase. Herein lies the issue.</p>

<p>It’s not really the PMs primary job to catch bugs in the UAT phase. Actually, when the Original Product Owner transferred the team responsibility to the new PM, the Original Product Owner never mentioned the QA they were doing in UAT. As a result, the team lost a critical QA resource and never thought about how to counteract that reality.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-responsibilities">Implicit Responsibilities</h2>

<p>When team’s grow, explicit responsibilities are often transferred deftly and quickly as new team members join. However, implicit or unstated responsibilities often fall by the wayside. It’s not part of the official checklist, it might not even be part of the job, but the reality remains - if you’re filling a gap and leave without finding a replacement, that gap is going to show up as soon as you leave.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you might have an explicit responsibility that you do way better than expected. Handing off that responsibility to someone who is not going to fully fill your shoes (even if at first), is another form of creating implicit gaps on the team.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>

<p>When you transition a team that you were previously a leader in, take stock of the things you were doing that weren’t part of the official role. Consider things that you are disproportionately owning for the team. It can be anything: meeting running, architecture, QA, recruiting.</p>

<p>Then, find ways to do some of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Let people know the gaps will exist. Announce the diagnosis.</li>
  <li>Find ways to personally ensure continuity and resource the gap.</li>
</ul>

                                <p>If you are in search of a great rollerball you have a lot of work ahead of you. There are many brands of rollerball pens and many styles of rollerball inks, as well as many sizes and colors.</p>
<p>We’ve done the testing and done the research to fine the best rollerball pens and rollerball refills available today.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Is_A_Rollerball_Pen">What Is A Rollerball Pen?</span></h2>
<p>As we noted in our <a href="https://unsharpen.com/ballpoint-vs-rollerball/">rollerball vs. ballpoint guide</a>, a rollerball is a pen that uses water-based ink where a ballpoint pen uses oil-based ink. Rollerballs use smaller writing tips — usually 0.5 mm or 0.7 mm — because their ink spreads out on the paper and forms lines that are wider than the tip of the pen. Most rollerballs use dye for color but some are pigments so they are water-resistant and semi-permanent.</p>
<p>Japanese pen maker Ohto is created with developing the first rollerball, then known as the “water-based ballpoint ink pen” in 1964.</p>

<p>In order to create this guide in a repeatable, methodical manner, we purchased a large number of rollerball pens and refills and use each across a number of different paper types. The favorite pens and refills were isolated and then used further, both for testing and real-world writing. The below rollerball pens — our top picks — are the ones we considered to be the finest rollerballs sold today.</p>
<p>Please note, that while the initial testing list included many rollerball pens, the list was not exhaustive and where are always pens and refills that will be missing in any test like this. Please contact us if you see anything notable missing.</p>
<p>Where possible all sizes of a rollerball were tested and both blue and black were testing. When options were limited the focus was on blue and 1.0 mm, which is where a rollerball can really differentiate itself from the competition.</p>
<p>Please note that gel pens were not part of this test. Gel pens have become their own category and will receive their own buying guide! <a href="https://unsharpen.com/rollerball-pen-fountain-pen-ink/">Refillable rollerball pens</a> are eligible for this list.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Mainstream_Rollerball_Pens">Best Mainstream Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you find yourself walking through the aisles of an office superstore and you want a great rollerball, what should you get? Or if you want a 12-pack of excellent, not-too-expensive rollerballs, what’s the best pick? These are the pens in this list.</p>
<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Vision_Elite">Uni-ball Vision Elite</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-vision-elite/">Uni-ball Vision Elite</a>&nbsp;has lone been a top pick among choosy rollerball fans as well as dedicated fountain pen users who want something for day-to-day writing. This pen is smooth, a bit watery in its ink, and uses Uni-ball’s Super Ink, which is chemical-, water-, and fade-resistant, plus is acid-free and of archival quality.</p>
<p>This pen is affordable, easy to find, quite smooth, and is reliable. The downsides are that its design is somewhat dated at this point, and it’s not really refillable <a href="https://amzn.to/3hrqYhu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">(the refills are almost full pens themselves</a>). This is the essence of a great everyday rollerball.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-450x51.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="51" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-450x51.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-1024x117.jpg 1024w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-768x87.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite.jpg 1476w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Air">Uni-ball Air</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-air/">Uni-ball Air</a>&nbsp;is a unique, high-tech take of the everyday rollerball. It also uses Uni-ball’s everything-resistant Super Ink and it’s similarly not refillable, but it has Uni’s “Cushion Tip” writing end which is smooth and forgiving, making the pen a great choice for almost all writing scenarios.</p>
<p>The pen isn’t refillable and has an entirely plastic body (including the clip), but it’s still a great everyday rollerball because it’s fun to use, easy to find, and a great writer overall.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Rollerball_Pens">Best Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you are in the market for a great rollerball pen and are willing to upgrade past a disposable pen, here are the top picks of 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="44" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-768x75.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Tombow_Zoom_505">Tombow Zoom 505</span></h3>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 combines an affordable metal body with a pigmented refill that is permanent and surprisingly fun to use, even though Tombow is not typically known for their rollerballs. The build quality of this pen’s body is excellent for the price which is surprising right around $20.</p>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 also benefits from being sold as a set of instruments. So if you like the rollerball, you can also buy the 505 in a mechanical pencil and a fountain pen. The downsides of this rollerball are that it has a proprietary refill, the older models of which tend to leak, but it’s still a great writer.</p>
<h3><span id="Lamy_Vista">Lamy Vista</span></h3>
<p>The Lamy Vista (the clear version of the Lamy Safari) uses Lamy’s <a href="https://unsharpen.com/refill/lamy-m63/">M63 rollerball refill</a>. This means the pen is a combination of a good rollerball refill and a great pen body. The good news is that the refill is easy to swap out if you want to use a standard European rollerball refill, like a Waterman or even a Pilot G2 gel refill. This is just an all-round great pen that is ideal for everyday use and will last you for years of writing.l</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="226" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-768x386.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-1024x515.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Pilot_Hi-Tecpoint_V7">Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V7</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pilot-precise-and-hi-tecpoint-pen-guide/">Hi-Tecpoint V7</a> is a refillable rollerball pen that uses fountain pen-like cartridges and a liquid rollerball ink. The pen is great looking, with a flat paint job, and handsome aesthetics. The pen is like a better version of the Pilot Precise V7 — which is much more common in the US — because the Hi-Tecpoint looks better and is refillable using a cartridge.</p>
<p>Then pen is also sold in a very wet 1.0 mm and a smooth but precise 0.5 mm version, called the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-v10-grip-hi-tecpoint/">V10</a> and V5 respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png" alt="" width="450" height="46" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Stabilo_Worker">Stabilo Worker+</span></h3>
<p>While it’s not as popular as the rest of the pens on this list, the Stabilo Worker+ is an excellent roller, as is its refillable counterpart, the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/stabilo-bionic/">Bionic</a>. These pens have confusing conventions, where the 0.5 mm Medium version writes more like a 1.0 mm, but they are both exceptionally smooth and comfortable pens.</p>
<p>The Worker+ is known for its bold orange body and comfortable rubber coating, but then pen is also available in black, grey, and now other colors if you want something more muted.</p>
<p>This is super smooth rollerball that deserves more attention.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A DC woman said an FBI agent contacted her and said investigators were reaching out to the owner of every phone that touched a cell tower near the riot.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — If you were anywhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, you may be getting a knock on your door from the FBI.</p>
                    <p>A D.C. woman said an agent visited her neighbor and called her, telling them investigators were tracking people whose cell phones connected to wi-fi or pinged cell phone towers near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                        
                    <p>"They don't call first, they just come to your house," Bree Stevens, a legal investigator who lives near Capitol Hill, said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens said an FBI agent told her they were reaching out to every single person whose cell phone put them near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                    <p>She was out for a walk with a friend and his two young daughters on the afternoon of Jan. 6, but they were diverted by bomb scares until they ended up right next to the insurrection. Adults and kids were cordoned off and unable to get back to their apartments for four hours.</p>
                    <p>"You don't want to be anywhere where they're going to go!" she said on a video she shot while police officers in riot gear quick-stepped toward the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><br>Monday night, an investigator knocked on the door of her friend's apartment, who was "in house clothes" at the time.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"His little girl had just painted his toenails, that was a little bit embarrassing," Stevens said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens was out of town, so the agent called her on the phone number that the FBI had tracked.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"Extremely creepy, because he explained that they have everyone’s phone number from pinging off the cell phone towers, and they know basically exactly where you were, within the vicinity of the Capitol," Stevens said. "And they can actually pinpoint on Google Maps exactly where you were standing. Like, he knew where I was standing on the sidewalk, like specifically, based on my cell phone ping."&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens said the agent told her she wasn't a suspect, but said he wanted pictures of things she might have seen.</p>
                    <p>Some civil rights advocates are concerned about the FBI's surveillance power.</p>
                    <p>When contacted, the FBI declined to discuss its investigative methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this proof of concept application, the main application starts a pool of web workers that it later uses to offload a series of heavy tasks.</p>

<p>The task in question is to to render a single frame of a simple 3D scene using ray-tracing (path-tracing). The computationally intensive rendering is performed by a <code>rust</code> library compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<p>These are the tools I used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code>post-me</code></strong> to communicate with the workers using a <code>Promise</code> API: <a href="https://alesgenova.github.io/introducing-post-me/">Blog</a> - <a href="https://github.com/alesgenova/post-me">Github</a></li>
  <li>My own toy ray tracing engine I implemented in rust a couple of years ago: <a href="https://github.com/alesgenova/ray-tracer">Github</a></li>
  <li><strong><code>wasm-bindgen</code></strong> to compile rust to wasm and create js bindings: <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">Github</a></li>
  <li>Small in-house task queue to dispatch tasks to workers when available.</li>
  <li><code>react</code> for the scheleton of the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to run this madness, an instance of this application is deployed <a href="https://alesgenova.github.io/ray-tracer-app/">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to see the details of the implementation, you can find the source code of the app on <a href="https://github.com/alesgenova/ray-tracer-app">Github</a></p>

<p>Using a similar approach, I also created an app that can detect the pitch of sounds being captured by the device’s microphone.</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><span><p>IRMA is a set of free and open source software projects implementing the Idemix attribute-based credential scheme, allowing users to safely and securely authenticate themselves as privacy-preserving as the situation permits. Users receive digitally signed attributes from trusted issuer, storing them in their IRMA app, after which the user can selectively disclose attributes to others. Schematically:</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/issuance.png" alt="issuance-flow">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclosure.png" alt="disclosure-flow">
</p>
<p>Using the issuer's digital signature over the attributes the verifier can verify that the attributes were given to the user in the past, and that they have not been modified since.</p>
<h2>IRMA session flow</h2>
<p>A typical IRMA session is depicted schematically below.</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/irmaflow.png" alt="IRMA session flow"></p>
<p>Software components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Requestor backend and frontend</em>: Generally the requestor runs a website with a (JavaScript) frontend in the user's browser, and a backend server. During an IRMA session the frontend displays the IRMA QR that the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> scans. All frontend tasks depicted in the diagram are supported by <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>: Handles IRMA protocol with the IRMA app for the requestor.</li>
<li><a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app"><em>IRMA mobile app</em></a>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.irmacard.cardemu">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/irma-authentication/id1294092994">iOS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Usually the session starts by the user performing some action on the website (e.g. clicking on "Log in with IRMA").</li>
<li>The requestor sends its <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests">session request</a> (containing the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed) to the <a href="#irma-servers">IRMA server</a>. Depending on its configuration, the IRMA server accepts the session request only if the session request is authentic (e.g. a validly signed <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests#jwts-signed-session-requests">session request JWT</a>) from an authorized requestor.</li>
<li>The IRMA server accepts the request and assigns a session token (a random string) to it. It returns the contents of the QR code that the frontend must display: the URL to itself and the session token.</li>
<li>The frontend (<a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>) receives and displays the QR code, which is scanned by the IRMA app.</li>
<li>The IRMA app requests the session request from step 1, receiving the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed.</li>
<li>The IRMA server returns the session request.</li>
<li>The IRMA app displays the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed, and asks the user if she wants to proceed.</li>
<li>The user accepts.</li>
<li>The IRMA server performs the IRMA protocol with the IRMA app, issuing new attributes to the user, or receiving and verifying attributes from the user's IRMA app, or receiving and verifying an attribute-based signature made by the user's app.</li>
<li>The session status (<code>DONE</code>, <code>CANCELLED</code>, <code>TIMEOUT</code>), along with disclosed and verified attributes or signature depending on the session type, are returned to the requestor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of these tasks are performed by the requestor's backend and which by its frontend differs case by case:
<ul>
<li>Often the session request is sent to the IRMA server by the requestor's backend, after which the IRMA server's reply in step 2 is forwarded to the frontend which renders it as a QR code. Step 1 can however also be done by <code>irma-frontend</code>, in which case <code>irma-frontend</code> automatically picks up the IRMA server's reply in step 2 and renders the QR code.</li>
<li>Similarly, <code>irma-frontend</code> can be instructed to fetch the session result in step 10, but this can also be done in the backend. In the latter, <code>irma-frontend</code> can fetch a custom result at your backend, if desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The IRMA server could be deployed on the same machine as the requestor's backend, but it need not be; possibly it is not even controlled by the requestor. Generally, steps 2/3 and 10 are done with REST HTTP calls to the IRMA server, but in case the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-lib"><code>irmaserver</code></a> library is used, these steps are function calls. Alternatively, you could use one of the packages in <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-backend"><code>irma-backend-packages</code></a> to do these steps with function calls in other programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session types</h2>
<p>In an IRMA session, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA mobile app</a> performs one of the following three <em>session types</em> with an <a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Disclosure sessions</em>: Upon receiving a list of requested attributes from the IRMA server, the app discloses the required attributes to the IRMA server if the app user agrees, after which they are verified by the IRMA server.</li>
<li><em>Attribute-based signature sessions</em>: Similar to disclosure sessions, but the attributes are attached to a message digitally signed into an <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#attribute-based-signatures"><em>attribute-based signature</em></a>. The attribute-based signature can be verified at any later time, ensuring that the signed message is intact, and that the IRMA attributes attached to it were valid at the time of creation of the attribute-based signature.</li>
<li><em>Issuance sessions</em>: the IRMA app receives a new set of IRMA attributes including valid issuer signatures from the IRMA server, to use in later disclosure or attribute-based signature sessions. (Possibly the user is asked to disclose some attributes as well, within the same IRMA session, before receiving the new attributes. This is called a <em>combined issuance-disclosure session</em>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is depicted schematically and explained in more detail in the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma#irma-session-flow">IRMA session flow</a> chapter. For the user, after scanning the QR in his/her IRMA app a disclosure session generally looks like the following. (Attribute-based signature sessions and issuance sessions are identical in terms of their flow (scan qr, provide permission, success screen); only the graphical interface is different.)</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-permission.png" alt="disclose-permission">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-done.png" alt="disclosure-done">
</p>
<h2>IRMA servers</h2>
<p>Various existing software components documented on this website can perform the role of the IRMA server.
Apart from exposing an API that is used by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> during IRMA sessions, each of these components also offer an API with which IRMA sessions can be started and monitored, for use by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#participants"><em>requestor</em></a>: the party wishing to issue attributes to or verify attributes from an IRMA app. The IRMA server handles the IRMA session with the IRMA app for the requestor.</p>
<p>Currently the following IRMA servers exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>irma server</code> command of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-cli"><code>irma</code></a> binary: a standalone daemon exposing its requestor API as HTTP endpoints. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>irmaserver</code> Go library, exposing a HTTP server that handles IRMA sessions with the IRMA app, and Go functions for starting and managing IRMA sessions. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-library">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server/irmaserver">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The now deprecated <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma_api_server"><code>irma_api_server</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About this documentation</h2>
<p>IRMA uses JSON to pass messages within IRMA sessions. The majority of IRMA is <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmago">written in Go</a>, and the JSON messages generally correspond to specific Go structs. For example, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server#get-session-token-result"><code>GET /session/{token}/result</code></a> endpoint of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server"><code>irma server</code></a> outputs instances of the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server#SessionResult"><code>server.SessionResult</code></a>.  In such cases, a link to the corresponding Go struct will be included. This can tell you what fields you can use or expect. (Note that some structs have custom (un)marshalers. See also the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go">Go documentation</a> on JSON and Go.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p><span><span> </span><time datetime="2020-12-19T01:43:33+00:00">December 19, 2020</time></span> </p><p>During the current pandemic, the ability to rapidly acquire, test, and report samples for the novel coronavirus has been essential for labs’ survival. Every COVID-19 testing lab demands a <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/">Laboratory Information Management System</a> (LIMS) to coordinate the huge influx of samples. For any lab to quickly test and report samples, their sample management software must have certain features to facilitate rapid testing. (Read: <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/blog/what-does-a-lims-do/">What is a LIMS?</a>)</p><p>These eight features of a sample management LIMS ensure your lab can easily and quickly handle a large number of COVID-19 samples.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #1: Highly Secure, Cloud-based, Accessible Anywhere on Any Device</h2><p>A variety of people will need to access your laboratory’s sample management software: physicians and nurses, laboratory testing personnel, management, and directors. The ideal solution is a cloud-based system they can all access on any internet-connected device.</p><p>A cloud-based LIMS can also be highly secure, able to manage any form of Protected Health Information (PHI). In fact, a large number of cloud-based systems currently store and process PHI every day, approved by and compliant with all pertinent regulatory agencies. To ensure PHI security, the LIMS system should absolutely require two-factor authentication (2FA) for anyone that accesses PHI.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #2: An Interface for Physicians to Order Tests and Review Results</h2><p>Here’s a nightmare for testing labs: The lab knows about a sample only when it shows up at their lab (known as “bluebird” samples, as they appear “out of the blue”). You can’t properly staff a lab if you do not know the number of samples that require testing on any given day. When each sample arrives with a paper test request form, laboratory technicians must enter all sample information from that paper form.</p><p>The process is extremely cumbersome and error-prone. Reading paper test request forms is a common challenge due to poor handwriting, poor quality printing, or damage during delivery. Many samples suffer significant testing delays from errors caused by lab staff forced to enter data directly from test request forms.</p><h3>Improving the sample testing order process</h3><p>There’s a far more accurate, efficient process. A sample test is ordered prior to the physician or healthcare provider shipping the sample. This advance order occurs through a special interface in the LIMS, such as a portal specifically for physicians or healthcare providers. With this process, the laboratory gains efficiencies by knowing the number of samples that will require testing on any given day. Lab staff need only to verify that the information on the test request form is consistent with the information entered into the LIMS.</p><p>Finally, if the LIMS is a cloud-based system (see feature #1), any physician or provider can easily order a test from any healthcare facility or sample acquisition location, such as various drive-through sample collection tents.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #3: Batched Sample Processing, Including Liquid Handlers</h2><p>Some available technologies make it extremely easy to test a single COVID-19 sample (such as single sample-single-use PCR amplification systems). But these systems are expensive for a single sample, and can generally only test a few samples per hour.</p><p>Any lab serious about performing COVID-19 testing can test hundreds of thousands of samples a day. To meet this throughput, the laboratory must have a sample management system that can process 96-well or 384-well plates that are full of samples.</p><p>The ability to simultaneously process 96 to 384 samples can require significant computation resources. <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/covid19/">A COVID-19 testing LIMS</a> must be able to handle this volume and process the appropriate controls concurrent with each sample.</p><p>Each lab may choose to batch samples differently or use different controls. Therefore, the LIMS must have the flexibility to be configured to the needs of each individual testing lab. This includes processing data files from different liquid handlers or qPCR instruments. Data files from each liquid handler program will likely be formatted differently, adding to the complexity the LIMS must be able to manage.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #4: Automated Data Analysis and Result Generation</h2><p>Each testing lab generates raw sample data from different instruments. Each file has its own unique format and sample naming conventions. The LIMS must absolutely be able to properly harvest this data. Ensuring that all data is accurately associated with its correct sample can be a tricky process, especially since most COVID-19 tests generate multiple data points for each tested sample (e.g. CT values for the three SARS-CoV-2 genes, and a CT for a spiked internal control).</p><p>After all testing data is appropriately associated with each sample, the LIMS should instantaneously analyze the sample and generate a result. The data auto-analysis can be exceptionally complicated. The LIMS must first assess all controls that are run with samples. Then the LIMS assesses the sample itself. Finally,&nbsp;it reviews the possible re-testing data if a sample is run multiple times (see feature #8 below). While some testing workflows use vendor software for raw data analysis, all values from analysis must still be accurately imported into the LIMS, and all re-testing values analyzed.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #5: Result Review and Automated Report Generation and Delivery</h2><p>After a the LIMS generates a sample result, a laboratory director (or other appropriate staff) must review the data. Considering the limited time these lab personnel usually have each day, it is paramount that they can review results for each sample easily.</p><p>They should be able to conduct the review of all negative samples in batch. Once the sample data are reviewed and approved, the LIMS should automatically generate a report. To prevent errors and save time, lab staff should never have to create a manual report, under any circumstances. The LIMS should always generate each sample report, even for amended reports.</p><p>All positive samples will likely require critical calls to the physician, healthcare provider, and/or patient. The LIMS must be able to easily and quickly document each critical call. If the LIMS also provides contact information for each individual sample — the contact may be different for each positive sample — that can be extremely helpful.</p><p>Finally, the LIMS should automatically deliver each report to the proper physician or healthcare provider. This delivery can take many forms, including a secure email or electronic fax, or by posting to the portal.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #6: Queue-based Sample Tracking</h2><p>Any serious COVID-19 testing lab will process hundreds or thousands of samples in a single day. For those labs, <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/sample-tracking/">sample tracking</a> can feel like a massive traffic jam. Lab staff must act as traffic cop while also taking responsibility for testing samples. Sample sheets, such as an Excel document, are commonly out-of-date and full of inaccuracies. This leads to poor turnaround time for sample testing and potentially “lost” samples during the testing process.</p><p>A good LIMS provides an easy solution: the ability to track all samples in a queue-based manner. Queue-based sample tracking places every sample onto a list, based on that sample’s current status. As each sample is processed, the LIMS should automatically update its status, and push the sample to the next queue.</p><p>This queue-based system is perfect for high-throughput sample testing. No sample leaves a list until its status is updated — you can never lose or accidentally forget any sample. Every sample remains on the queue until it is tested.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #7: Re-testing of Invalid or Inconclusive Samples</h2><p>All testing labs understand that samples frequently fail and require re-testing. Unfortunately, sample re-testing can be a messy process. Do you create a new sample record for the re-test or overwrite the first sample’s data? Do you have to put a new barcode on the sample to re-test it? Can the data auto-analysis manage re-test results?</p><p>A LIMS must address these re-testing problems in a COVID-19 sample testing environment. It is usually not acceptable to simply overwrite initial failed sample data, so the LIMS must generate a new sample record for re-testing.&nbsp; Each re-test record must be appropriately updated during the re-testing process, making sure the original sample record isn’t accidentally updated. The data auto-analysis must be able to accurately calculate a final patient result, accounting for all sample testing results.</p><p>Finally, few labs will run re-test samples in a separate batch.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In a previous post <a href="https://brunocalza.me/discovering-and-exploring-mmap-using-go/">Discovering and exploring mmap using Go</a>, we talked about how databases have a major problem to solve, which is: <strong>how to deal with data stored in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. We talked about how many databases solve this problem using <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> and explored <strong>mmap</strong> capabilities.</p><p>Knowing that databases use <strong>memory-mapped files </strong>to solve the problem was not enough for me. It solved part of the mystery but a question remained: <strong>how, exactly, databases use <em>mmap</em> to read and write data from disk?</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I decided to dig through a database source code to answer that question. There are plenty of databases that use mmap. Some of them decided to not use anymore. Some examples: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> has an option of accessing disk content directly using memory-mapped I/O<sup>[1]</sup>, it seems <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a> used to use but it changed it<sup>[2]</sup>, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> has an option with <em>MMapDirectory</em><sup>[3]</sup>, <a href="https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/">LMDB</a> uses mmap<sup>[4]</sup>, a simple key/value in-memory database from Counchbase called <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/moss">moss</a> uses mmap for durability of in-memory data<sup>[5]</sup> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> removed <strong>mmap</strong> storage engine for <em>WiredTiger</em><sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">bolt</a>, a simple <strong>key/value store</strong> implemented in <strong>Go</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">Ben Johnson</a> inspired by the <strong>LMDB</strong> project, for this endeavor. Mostly because of source code simplicity and my familiarity with Go language. I know a simple key/value store might not be the most complete source code for learning all the details of reading/writing data to disk, but as I have found out, it was more than enough to get a grasp of it. </p><p>The original bolt repository is no longer maintained. A fork of <strong>bolt</strong> called <strong>bbolt</strong> is maintained and used by <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt">etcd</a>. If you are not familiar with <strong>bolt</strong>, I recommend the articles <a href="https://npf.io/2014/07/intro-to-boltdb-painless-performant-persistence/">Intro to BoltDB: Painless Performant Persistence</a> and <a href="https://www.progville.com/go/bolt-embedded-db-golang/">Bolt — an embedded key/value database for Go </a>.</p><h2 id="the-start">The start</h2><p>I download the code to my machine and opened it in my editor. I thought a good place to start digging was to find out where the database was initialized and look for any references of <strong>mmap</strong> there. Like most embedded databases, <strong>bolt </strong>has an <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L150">Open</a> method for opening the database or creating a new one if it does not exist. Inside it, I found a reference to a private <strong>mmap</strong> function. That's a good start. </p><pre><code>// Memory map the data file.
if err := db.mmap(options.InitialMmapSize); err != nil {
    _ = db.close()
    return nil, err
}</code></pre><h2 id="how-much-memory-should-i-allocate">How much memory should I allocate?</h2><p>The private <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20(db%20*DB)%20mmap(minsz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a> is responsible for opening the memory-mapped file. In order to do this, it needs to figure out how much memory it is going to allocate. This task is accomplished by another method called <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a>. Given the size of the database, this method figures out how many bytes of memory should be allocated.</p><p>It starts by doubling the size from <strong>32KB</strong> to <strong>1GB</strong>. But if the database is larger than <strong>1GB</strong>, it grows <strong>1GB</strong> at a time.</p><pre><code>// Double the size from 32KB until 1GB.
for i := uint(15); i &lt;= 30; i++ {
	if size &lt;= 1&lt;&lt;i {
		return 1 &lt;&lt; i, nil
	}
}

...

// If larger than 1GB then grow by 1GB at a time.
sz := int64(size)
if remainder := sz % int64(maxMmapStep); remainder &gt; 0 {
	sz += int64(maxMmapStep) - remainder
}</code></pre><p>It is all fine by now. That's how <strong>bolt</strong> figured out how much to allocate. But there is a piece of the puzzle now that will be very important when we talk about database storage layout. After figuring out how much to allocate, it needs to ensure that the allocated size is a multiple of the <strong>page size</strong>. If you are not familiar with database storage and don't know what a <strong>page</strong> is, don't worry, we'll be back to this.</p><pre><code>// Ensure that the mmap size is a multiple of the page size.
// This should always be true since we're incrementing in MBs.
pageSize := int64(db.pageSize)
if (sz % pageSize) != 0 {
	sz = ((sz / pageSize) + 1) * pageSize
}</code></pre><p>Shouldn't it check if we are allocating more than we have available? That's the last piece of the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a> method.</p><pre><code>// If we've exceeded the max size then only grow up to the max size.
if sz &gt; maxMapSize {
	sz = maxMapSize
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bolt_amd64.go#L4">maxMapSize</a> constant is set to <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFF</code> on <strong>AMD64</strong> architectures.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote>The <strong>AMD64</strong> architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address format, of which the low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations. This allows up to 256 TiB (2<sup>48</sup> bytes) of virtual address space. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64 Wiki</a></blockquote><p>This is the limit of the <strong>bolt</strong> database file.</p><h2 id="calling-the-system-call">Calling the system call</h2><p>Now that <strong>bolt</strong> knows how much it should allocate, it calls the system call <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20mmap(db%20*DB,%20sz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a>. Here is the full code for <em>Unix</em>-like environments:</p><pre><code>// mmap memory maps a DB's data file.
func mmap(db *DB, sz int) error {
	// Map the data file to memory.
	b, err := syscall.Mmap(int(db.file.Fd()), 0, sz, syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED|db.MmapFlags)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Advise the kernel that the mmap is accessed randomly.
	if err := madvise(b, syscall.MADV_RANDOM); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("madvise: %s", err)
	}

	// Save the original byte slice and convert to a byte array pointer.
	db.dataref = b
	db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
	db.datasz = sz
	return nil
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It is a pretty straightforward code. I have some observations to make about <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code>, but I'll leave for the next session. It is nice to see the call to madvise there, although I don't know its benefits. I would love to know the importance of that call, if it improves performance or if another flag could be set to get different behavior from OS for different use cases.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The mapped memory is set to the variables <code>db.dataref</code> and <code>db.data</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>db.dataref = b
db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I would like to know about the importance of keeping track of both variables. I could not grasp what is going on in the conversion to <code>db.data</code>. But anyway, what we have to keep in mind is that is through these variables that <strong>bolt</strong> will read data from disk.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-about-writes">What about writes?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While skimming through the source code, I looked for evidence of how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for both reads and writes. I dug both <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L266">Get</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L285">Put</a> method. I could not find any place where the references to <code>db.dataref</code> or <code>db.data</code> were being updated. I discovered that the writes to disk happen when <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/tx.go#L144">Commit</a> is called to a transaction. But there I could only find calls to <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.WriteAt">WriteAt</a>. So I gave up my search of trying to understand how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for writes.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Then, suddenly, while looking back to the call of <strong>mmap</strong>, I noticed the  <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code> flag that I have not noticed the first time I looked at the code. So <strong>mmap</strong>, is only used for reads in <strong>bolt</strong>. Another place that indicates this is in the definition of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L100">DB struct</a>:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>dataref  []byte   // mmap'ed readonly, write throws SEGV
data     *[maxMapSize]byte</code></pre><p>That made perfect sense to me. Since flushes to disk are very hard to control when using <strong>mmap</strong>, it is probably the safest approach. How <strong>bolt</strong> does writing is a topic of another post. </p><h2 id="how-the-database-file-is-structured">How the database file is structured?</h2><p>We know how and when<strong> bolt </strong>allocates memory and that <strong>mmap</strong> is not used for writes. But how, exactly, <strong>bolt</strong> can find the value of a key? To understand that, we have to understand how typically databases structure their files. I am not going to do deep here. Mostly because I don't understand enough to go deep. Just going to try to give a glimpse of what is going on. </p><p>A file is just an array of bytes. We have to apply some reasoning to this array of bytes to work with it effectively. Databases structure their files in disk into blocks (chunks of bytes) called <strong>pages</strong>. <strong>bolt </strong>is no different. The database file can be seen as</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/01/image--17-.png" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Each page has a <strong>fixed length of bytes</strong>, typically the same size as the OS page (usually <code>4096 bytes</code>). Here is the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L40">part</a> of <strong>bolt</strong> that sets the <code>pageSize</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>// default page size for db is set to the OS page size.
var defaultPageSize = os.Getpagesize()
</code></pre><p>Every database has its own page layout. The page layout of <strong>bolt</strong> is defined at <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/page.go#L28">page.go</a> as</p><pre><code>const (

	leafPageFlag     = 0x02

<li><code>id</code>: it is the page identifier used to index the page. Given a page id, I can locate it in the disk through <strong>mmap</strong>, since the disk file is just a list of continuous fixed length pages;</li>
<li><code>flags</code>: it tells the page type. There are four types of page: <code>meta</code>, <code>freeList</code>, <code>leaf</code> and <code>branch</code>;</li>
<li><code>count</code>: indicates the number of elements stored in the page;</li>
<li><code>overflow</code>: represents the number of subsequent pages;</li>

I hope the abstraction I created will be enough to get a clue about what is going on.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>What if the pages themselves, in the data part, contained references to other pages?

In a <strong>B+Tree</strong> we have internal nodes and leaves. That's the reason for the `flags` attribute, to indicate what kind of node that page is.</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/01/image--18-.png" alt=""><figcaption>Abstract representation of a B+Tree in <strong>bolt</strong></figcaption></figure><p>So to perform the search of a key, you start at the root node a do a B+Tree traversal on mmapped disk pages.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Human beings find comfort in certainty. We form governments, make calendars, and create organisations; and we structure our activities, strategies and plans around these constructs. These routines give us the satisfaction of knowing that, by having a plan, thereâ€™s a means of it coming to fruition.</p>
<p>But thereâ€™s another force, constantly at play in life, that often makes the greatest difference to our futures: the â€˜unexpectedâ€™ or the â€˜unforeseenâ€™. If you think about it, you already look out for the unexpected every day, but perhaps only as a defence mechanism. For example, whenever you use a pedestrian crossing on a busy road, you look out for the unexpected driver who might race through the red light. That â€˜alertnessâ€™ to, or awareness of, the unexpected is at the centre of understanding the science of (smart) luck and exploiting it to your benefit.</p>
<p>In my research into what makes individuals and organisations fit for the future, one insight has come up again and again: many of the worldâ€™s leading minds have developed a capacity, often unconscious, to turn the unexpected into positive outcomes. Developing this â€˜serendipity mindsetâ€™, as I <a href="https://theserendipitymindset.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> it, is both a philosophy of life and a capability that you can shape and nurture in yourself. (Note, while this approach has been <a href="https://ssir.org/books/excerpts/entry/cultivating_serendipity" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">successful</a> across many settings, it does need to go hand in hand with tackling the structural inequality related to factors such as race, gender and income.)</p>
<p>You might think of serendipity as passive luck that just happens to you, when actually itâ€™s an active process of spotting and connecting the dots. It is about seeing bridges where others see gaps, and then taking initiative and action(s) to create smart luck. Serendipity is a guiding force in great scientific discoveries but itâ€™s also present in our everyday lives, in the smallest of moments as well as the greatest life-changing events. Itâ€™s how we often â€˜unexpectedlyâ€™ find love, a co-founder, a new job, or a business partner â€“ and itâ€™s how inventions such as Post-it Notes, X-rays, penicillin, microwaves and many other innovations came about.</p>
<p>My research suggests that serendipity has three core characteristics. It starts with a serendipity <em>trigger</em> â€“ the moment when you encounter something unusual or unexpected. Next, you need to <em>connect the dots</em> â€“ that is, observe the trigger and link it to something seemingly unrelated, thus realising the potential value within the chance event (sometimes referred to as a Eureka moment). Finally, <em>sagacity and tenacity</em> are required to follow through and create an unexpected positive outcome. While a particular chance encounter is an event, serendipity is a multifaceted process, as the figure below shows (note that the trigger and connecting the dots often happen at the same time).</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1434/new-inset-graphic-.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>Figure supplied by the author.</figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>To be lucky, itâ€™s often essential to be open and alert to the unexpected. Consider an entertaining experiment that the British psychologist Richard Wiseman carried out for a BBC TV show some time ago, which involved just two people: one who saw himself as â€˜luckyâ€™, and one who identified herself as â€˜unluckyâ€™. The researchers asked both participants to take separate trips to a coffee shop outside which theyâ€™d placed a Â£5 note on the pavement. Inside, someone posing as a successful businessman sat at the table by the counter. The â€˜lucky personâ€™ approached, spotted the money and picked it up. Inside, he ordered a coffee, sat next to the businessman and struck up a conversation with him. The self-described â€˜unluckyâ€™ person, on the other hand, failed to notice the money or talk to the businessman. Later, the researchers asked both participants how their day had been. The â€˜luckyâ€™ person reported having had a great day â€“ heâ€™d found money in the street, and made a new friend (who might lead him to additional opportunities). Meanwhile, the â€˜unluckyâ€™ person described her day as uneventful. So, although both participants had the same chances, only one was able to â€˜seeâ€™ them.</p>
<p>Such an experiment â€“ while lighthearted â€“ shows that your mindset, and how you think about possibility in your life, can affect your ability to be alert when opportunity occurs. In fact, the terms â€˜unexpectedâ€™, â€˜extraordinaryâ€™ and â€˜unlikelyâ€™ are misleading because accidents or coincidences happen all the time. But we must be able to see the opportunity in the moment.</p>
<p>Although being alert to the unexpected is vital for creating smart luck, there is another key factor: preparation. This is partly about removing the barriers to serendipity, both mental (your mindset) and physical (the spaces you live and interact in), such as: overloaded schedules; senseless meetings; and the inefficiencies throughout your day that rob you of time, curiosity and a sense of joy. You can prepare by strengthening your mental readiness to connect with opportunity, and creating an environment that enables the use of your skills and available resources to act on the moment. An unprepared mind often discards unusual encounters, thereby missing the opportunities for smart luck. But this is a learned behaviour. Preparation is about developing the capacity to accelerate and harness the positive coincidences that show up in life. In this Guide, I will show you the basics of how to do this.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Recognise and challenge your biases</strong></p>
<p>Our habits of thought and preconceptions about the world can make it difficult to spot or harness serendipity. They shape our behaviour and how we interact with the world. There are three major biases that will require the most attention to overcome if weâ€™re to effectively cultivate serendipity: underestimating the unexpected; hindsight bias; and functional fixedness.</p>
<p><em><strong>Underestimating the unexpected.</strong></em> Itâ€™s natural to underestimate the unexpected, but when you do, you tune out opportunities to create smart luck. Yes, itâ€™s unlikely that, on the day of your big presentation, Zoom crashes. Itâ€™s unlikely that the person who was supposed to evaluate your presentation gets sick. Itâ€™s unlikely that you spill coffee over your laptop right before the presentation. But add up all these unlikely events, and it becomes relatively likely that something unexpected might happen. Experienced presenters will often have a joke for when things go wrong â€“ knowing that, often, they do â€“ which tends to bring the audience over to their side as they appear to be quick on their feet and comfortable sharing their humanness. The same logic applies to all the good things that can happen throughout the day. Only once we accept that the unexpected happens all the time do we start â€˜seeingâ€™ it (like the â€˜luckyâ€™ person who spotted the money planted on the street in the experiment above) â€“ and begin to view it as a potential benefit or opportunity rather than a threat.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hindsight bias.</strong></em> When we construct stories of past events, we often act as if there was a linear trajectory, even though reality most probably followed a squiggly path. This can lead us to perceive events as having been more predictable than they were (known as â€˜hindsight biasâ€™), and to construct narratives that conveniently explain everything, ignoring the role of chance. This post-rationalisation speaks to our human need to find familiarity in the unknown, and to control anomalies. However, if you continually airbrush the many unexpected events out of your (hi)stories, youâ€™ll miss the importance of the unpredictable parts and therefore fail to recognise â€“ let alone legitimise â€“ the critical role that serendipity will play in your future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Functional fixedness.</strong></em> Whenever we use a tool in everyday life, weâ€™re so accustomed to its usual specific function that weâ€™re often unable to see its usefulness in other contexts â€“ a bias known as â€˜functional fixednessâ€™. Similarly, <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/ADAFFA-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that individuals who are familiar with specific problem-solving strategies are unlikely to devise simpler ones, even if and when it could be appropriate. In other words, we tend to do many things out of habit â€“ weâ€™ll often persist with â€˜the hard wayâ€™ simply because itâ€™s the way we already know. Having the mental agility to improvise, to see how a tool could be used in a new way, is essential to building your serendipity mindset. Think of fictional characters, such as Lara Croft or James Bond, and how â€“ thanks to their quick-wittedness â€“ they manage to turn any ordinary object into a deadly weapon. While this is a Hollywood clichÃ©, weâ€™re nonetheless impressed by these characters because we recognise their talent and resourcefulness â€¦ and perhaps how unlikely we might have been to think of that solution when faced with their predicament. Your own creativity will thrive when you abandon the physical and mental tools with which youâ€™re most familiar, and find new ways to work or think.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivate your serendipity mindset</strong></p>
<p>As well as challenging your innate biases and making a conscious effort to think beyond your usual models or fixed ways of thinking, there are many more practical steps you can take to help develop or strengthen your serendipity muscle. Here are four. Together, theyâ€™ll help you identify the clutter in your life, clean it up and create space for serendipity; forge more connections; and see opportunity in crisis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Get in the habit of journalling</strong></em><strong>.</strong> If you are new to <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/to-start-to-heal-from-trauma-in-your-life-write-about-it" rel="noopener">journalling</a>, donâ€™t overthink it. Set a timer for two minutes, then list out in two columns the parts of your day that led to positive outcomes and the parts of the day that did not. As you break down your day into these segments, examine the parts that worked really well for you, and the ones that were inefficient, stressful or unfulfilling. You might begin to notice some patterns that stand out, for good or bad. Journalling and reflection is a way to begin decluttering your life, to explore the areas that take you out of being present, and …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

									<p>The Italian data protection authority on Friday ordered video sharing platform TikTok to immediately stop collecting and using data of users whose ages it doesn't know "with certainty." </p>
<p>The order comes after a 10-year-old girl in the Sicilian city of Palermo <a href="https://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2021/01/21/girl-10-brain-dead-after-taking-tiktok-blackout-challenge_4fd482a0-e3f3-47ed-b8ab-29e7a81dc33a.html" target="_blank">died from asphyxiation after participating in a so-called blackout challenge on the social network.</a> Users must be 13-years-old or older to set up an account, according to the company's policies.</p>
<p>"The authority has decided to intervene as a matter of urgency following the terrible story of the 10-year-old girl from Palermo," <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9524224" target="_blank">the authority, called Garante, said in a statement Friday</a>.</p>

<p>Ordinarily privacy enforcement against TikTok would be led by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), since the platform is legally established in Dublin. But Garante said it is invoking an emergency procedure that allows it to act directly against the company. It said it had notified the Irish authority of the restrictions, which will initially be in place until February 15.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Irish DPC declined to comment on Garante's order, but confirmed that the DPC has been TikTok's lead authority under EU rules since mid-December.</p>
<p>The action comes while Garante was already investigating TikTok, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1558838">having initiated a formal procedure against the app in December.</a> TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. </p>

    </audio>
</p>
                    <p>I’ll start my article from the biggest myth about NixOS. And soon you’ll know why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DevOps-friendly. Declarative specs and safe upgrades make NixOS a great system for DevOps use. NixOps, the NixOS cloud deployment tool, allows you to provision and manage networks of NixOS machines in environments like Amazon EC2 and VirtualBox. (c) <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will continuously update this article each time I’ll face a new weird and challenging task that makes your life much harder if you’re using NixOS instead of traditional Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Well, I’m a lucky guy… I have no choice right now and have to spend most of my working time on NixOS automation. To this moment of time I have more than 10 years experience of using different Linux distributions and more than 6 months of NixOS experience. And most of my experience with NixOS is bad experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-may-want-to-use-nixos">Why you may want to use NixOS.</h2>
<p>I’ll try to write something here. Hope, I’ll be able to…</p>
<h3 id="determinism">Determinism.</h3>
<p>It is declared and provided to you by the system design, that you’ll get the same version of any software package from the derivation. Lie!</p>
<p>All it’s determinism is about that it deterministically gives you a lot of issues, which you need to overcome manually without any support.</p>
<p>You may install Nix tools on Linux and OS X, for example. But it is not always building the same derivation results on Linux and NixOS itself. So, it is not OS agnostic. There’re a lot of examples of such behavior, for example, <code>fetchgit</code> and <code>fetchFromGitHub</code> functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/28324">fetchgit/fetchFromGitHub fail to fetch submodules from “git@server:repo” URLs</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/issues/260">Use <code>fetchFromGitHub</code> instead of <code>fetchgit</code> when the source is a GitHub clone URL</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/27327">fetchgit -&gt; fetchFromGitHub where possible</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/1880">How to manually replicate/reproduce/obtain the sha256 hash specified in Nix with fetchgit or fetchFromGitHub?</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile in the official manual to the current and latest <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#version-18-09-1373-50fb6820759">version-18-09-1373-50fb6820759</a> they are still using <code>fetchgit</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-never-ever-use-nixos">Why you should never ever use NixOS.</h2>
<p>Here I’m gonna collect all my daily pain in a single place, which I hope will help people not to make somebody’s else mistakes. This is my personal view on the problem space and it can not be affiliated with the company or project where I’m working right now.</p>

<p>Sure, there are a lot of enthusiasts who are playing with NixOS by installing it on their workstations of VMs, but in comparison with Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian or RedHat:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That means you will not be able:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get fast or enterprise support.</li>
<li>To to hire people to manage it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation.</h3>
<p>Official documentation is awful. Or it is just absent. NixOS is older than Docker. They are solving the same task, but NixOS is way less popular. Try to think why.</p>
<p>NIX CONFIGURATION LANGUAGE
It is functional language which name is also Nix and it is a core of this system configuration. If you’re coming from OOP world it will be very difficult to understand that “language”. You must go to swallow <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/">Nix pills</a> to even try to understand something about it.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT
“Derivation” is a way of describing software distribution in NixOS. Each derivation represents software, plugin or a library. Common syntax of describing it looks like this (nginx derivation example):</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Interesting, isn’t it?</p>
<p>If yes, get ready, you’ll not be able to live in the system without writing something like that. <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">Nix Packages GitHub repository</a> will be your second home, where you’ll be looking for examples of Nix expressions, configuration approaches and other examples.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-management">Configuration management.</h3>
<p>System state and configuration described in a special file <code>configuration.nix</code>. It’s like an entry point to endless amount of functions and dependencies for your OS.</p>
<p>Want to customize something in the OS, be ready, you’ll need to write your custom <code>systemd</code> service to do that. Aaand, yes, service configuration file also need to be declared using Nix expression language.</p>
<p>All standard system configuration files like <code>/etc/fstab</code>, for example are generated by a weird code and read only.</p>
<p>Forget about Chef, Puppet or Ansible! Only Nix expressions! Only hardcore!</p>
<h3 id="kernel-upgrade">Kernel upgrade.</h3>
<p>It is not possible just to upgrade the kernel from “ver1” to “ver2”. New kernel will bring whole set of system packages and their dependencies with it. Do not know if it is safe. Will test it soon.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-support">Cloud support.</h3>
<p>Nix is not ready for a cloud. At all. I’m always facing the following situations on NixOS 18.03:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS is not booting from the AMI.</li>
<li>OS is not supporting newest AWS instance types (like m5.*, for example).</li>
<li>NixOS 18.03 is not always able to resize your hard drive when it’s boot.</li>
<li>Do not even try to use it in Auto Scaling group and passing configuration.nix content through user-data. You may easily get to the loop, when instance start building something new from the derivations during it’s boot process, 100% CPU utilizations will require AutoScaling Group to launch additional instances that also will build something, all the instances are unhealthy and Auto Scaling group will start terminating the first instance in a loop. Your service will never start.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cache">Cache.</h3>
<p>To speedup software installation in NixOS the community provides you with Nix Binary Cache, where they put everything they’ve built successfully. Every version of every derivation.</p>
<p>Problems start happening when you spinning up your personal cache, which is used, for example to store your proprietary build artifacts. You always need to keep eye on the community channel version you’re using as a base for your builds. And yes, your own cache size will also grow very fast!</p>
<p>Some very talented developers start using Nix binary cache to cache everything’s possible. For example NPM or Yarn packages. Good luck!</p>
<h3 id="security">Security.</h3>
<p>People are thinking, that NixOS deterministic approach of dealing with software is very secure. Maybe yes, it is really not possible to hijack the build results once the derivation bin build. But… You always need to pay for it…</p>
<p>During the upgrade from 18.03 to 18.09 Nix community decided to change Docker tools they’ve been use to calculate derivations checksums where you were dealing with Docker images.</p>
<p>As a result we rewrote all Docker based derivation declarations and more over to rebuild them all. It was really painful and unmanaged migration.</p>
<h3 id="windows-support">Windows support.</h3>
<p>Just forget about it.</p>
<h3 id="system-requirements">System requirements.</h3>
<p>It requires a lot of CPU power to build it’s stuff and really a lot of space to store its multiple versions. Much more, than you need in traditional Linux distros.</p>
<h3 id="once-invested">Once invested.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try to change a technology stack as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Do not listen anybody.</li>
<li>Do not reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>Just waste it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, God, do not try to run Nix in Docker! It’s really, not, REALLY bad idea!</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next.</h3>
<p>Run away! Not, seriously! Run. From. It. Away.</p>
<p>When you try to summarize all your thoughts around the topic you want to cover in a post, you’re starting from simple Google search. One of results to my “nixos pros and cons” query: <a href="https://alternative.me/nixos">NixOS alternatives</a>. Kinda joke, but really, think twice when you’re making decision to invest your time or money in it. And I would also think …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

        <!--<h1>Monoids</h1> -->
        

<p>Since we are done with categories, letâ€™s look at some other structures that are also interesting - monoids. Like categories, monoids/groups are also abstract systems consisting of objects and rules for manipulating these objects.</p>



<p>Monoids are simpler than categories. A monoid is defined by a collection (set) of elements and an operation that allows us to combine two element and produce a third one of the same kind.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s take our familiar colourful balls.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls.svg" alt="Balls"></p>

<p>In this case a monoid would be a rule (operation) for â€œcombiningâ€� two balls into one.</p>

<p>An example of such rule would be blending the colors of the balls, as if we are mixing paint.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_rule.svg" alt="A rule for combining balls"></p>

<p>You can probably think of other ways to define such a rule. This will help you realize that there can be many ways to create a monoid from a given set of items. The monoid is not the set itself, it is the set <em>together with the rule</em>.</p>

<h2 id="associativity">Associativity</h2>

<p>The monoid rule should, like functional composition, be â€œassociativeâ€� i.e. applying it on the same number of elements in a different order should make no difference.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_associativity.svg" alt="Associativity in the color mixing operation"></p>

<p>When a rule is associative, this means we can use all kinds of algebraic operations to any sequence of terms (or in other words to apply equation reasoning), like for example we can replace any element with a set of elements from which it is composed of, or add a term that is present at both sides of an equation and retaining the equality of the existing terms.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_arithmetic.svg" alt="Associativity in the color mixing operation"></p>

<h2 id="the-identity-element">The identity element</h2>

<p>Actually, not any (associative) rule for combining elements makes the balls form a monoid (it makes them form a â€œsemigroupâ€�, which is also a thing, but thatâ€™s a separate topic). In order to be a monoid, a set must feature what is called an â€œidentity elementâ€� of a given rule (or a <em>zero</em> element, if you prefer) - one that, when combined with any other element gives back that same element not the identity but the other one. Or simply <strong>x â€¢ i = x and i â€¢ x = x for any x</strong>. In the case of our color-mixing monoid the identity element is the white  ball (or perhaps a transparent one, if we have one).</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_identity.svg" alt="The identity element of the color-mixing monoid"></p>

<p>As you probably remember from the last chapter, functional composition is also associative and it also contains an identity element, so you might start suspecting that it forms a monoid in some way. And it is really the case with one little caveat.</p>

<p>To keep the suspense alive, letâ€™s see some simpler monoids before we dwelve into that:</p>



<h2 id="monoids-from-numbers">Monoids from numbers</h2>

<p>Mathematics is not all about numbers, however numbers do tend to pop up in most of its areas and monoids are no exception. The set of natural numbers <em>N</em> form a monoid when combined with the all too familiar operation of addition (or to use the official terminology <em>N</em> <em>form</em> a monoid <em>under</em> addition).</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/numbers_addition.svg" alt="The monoid of numbers under addition"></p>

<p>(if you see a <strong>1 + 1 = 2</strong> in your textbook you know you are working on math foundations (or you are in kindergarten)).</p>

<p>The natural numbers also form a monoid under multiplication as well:</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/numbers_multiplication.svg" alt="The monoid of numbers under multiplication"></p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Which are the identity elements of those monoids?</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Go through other mathematical operations and figure out why donâ€™t they are not monoidal.</p>

<h2 id="monoids-from-boolean-algebra">Monoids from boolean algebra</h2>

<p>Thinking about other operations that we covered (operation being a function which takes a pair of element of a given type and returns one element of the same type), we may remember the boolean operations <strong>AND</strong> and <strong>OR</strong>. which operate on the set, consisting of just two values <strong>{ True, False }</strong>. Those operations form monoids too. Proving that they do is easy enough by just enumerating all cases.</p>

<p>We can prove that <strong>AND</strong> is associative by expanding the formula <strong>(A AND B) AND C = A AND (B AND C)</strong> in all possible ways:</p>

<p><strong>(TRUE AND FALSE) AND TRUE = TRUE AND (FALSE AND TRUE)</strong></p>

<p><strong>(TRUE AND FALSE) AND FALSE = TRUE AND (FALSE AND FALSE)</strong></p>

<p><strong>(FALSE AND FALSE) AND TRUE = FALSE AND (FALSE AND TRUE)</strong></p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>And we can prove that <strong>TRUE</strong> is the identity element by expanding the other formulas that state that for all elements <strong>A</strong> <strong>I AND A = A</strong></p>

<p><strong>FALSE AND TRUE = FALSE</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRUE AND TRUE = TRUE</strong></p>

<p>â€¦and then do the same for <strong>A AND I = A</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="intuitions">Intuitions</h2>

<p>In order to form the correct intuition about monoids, try to avoid thinking of the elements in the set as objects, but instead think of them as <em>actions</em>. For example, when thinking about numbers donâ€™t think of them as <em>quantities</em> (as in two apples, two oranges etc.), but as <em>operations</em>, (e.g. as the action of adding one to a given quantity). In other words, donâ€™t think of the element by itself, but only think of it together with the operation (in this case addition).</p>

<p>This touches a programming concept which is very popular in category-theory inspired languages - currying - that is based on the idea that a function that accepts two arguments together with one of those arguments already supplied can be viewed as a function which takes one argument. e.g. the function <code>add(number, number)</code> together with the element <code>2</code> is equivalent to the <code>addTwo(number)</code> function.</p>

<p>In general, we use monoids and related structures as a way to model how a set of (associative) actions that are performed on a given object (or objects) alter itâ€™s state. We can do that, provided that the objectâ€™s state is determined solemnly by the actions that are performed on it, this allows us to leave the object out of the equation and concentrate on how the actions are combined. And as per usual in the actions (and objects) can be anything, from mixing colors in paint, or adding a quantities to a given set of things etc.</p>



<p>Monoid operations obey two laws - they are associative and there is an identity element. In some cases we come across operations that also obey other laws that are also interesting. Imposing more (or less) rules to the way in which actions are combinded results in the definition of other monoid-like structures.</p>

<h2 id="commutative-abelian-monoids">Commutative (abelian) monoids</h2>

<p>Looking at the monoid laws and the examples we gave so far, we observe that all of them obey one more rule (law) which we didnâ€™t specify - the order in which the operations are applied is irrelevant to the end result.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/monoid_commutative.svg" alt="Commutative monoid operation"></p>

<p>Such operations (ones for which combining a given set of objects yields the same result no matter which one is first and which one is second) are called <em>commutative</em> operations. Monoids with operations that are commutative are called <em>commutative monoids</em>.</p>

<p>As we said, addition is commutative as well - it does not matter whether if I have given you 1 apple and then 2 more, or if I have given you 2 first and then 1 more.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/addition_commutative.svg" alt="Commutative monoid operation"></p>

<p>All monoids that we examined so far are also <em>commutative</em>, but we will see some non-commutative ones later.</p>

<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>

<p>A group is a monoid in which each element has what is called an â€œinverseâ€� element where the element and its inverse cancel each other out when applied one after the other, in other words , <strong>forall x, there must exist xâ€™ such that x â€¢ xâ€™ = i</strong> ( where <strong>i</strong> is the identity element).</p>

<p>If we view <em>monoids</em> as a means of modelling the effect of applying a set of (associative) actions, we use <em>groups</em> to model the effects of actions are also <em>reversible</em>.</p>

<p>An nice example of a group can be found in the realm of numbers (really, numbers are a nice example of almost all laws) - it is the set of integers under addition, where the inverse of each number is its opposite number (positive numbersâ€™ inverse are negatives and vice versa). The above formula, then, becomes <strong>x + (-x) = 0</strong></p>

<p>The study of groups is a field that is much bigger than the theory of monoids (and perhaps bigger than category theory itself).</p>

<p>And it all started with the what are now called the â€œsymmetry groupsâ€� which we will look into in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The algebraic structures that we saw can be summarized based on the laws that define them in this table.</p>

<p>An interesting kinds of groups/monoids are the groups of <em>symmetries</em> of geometric figures. Given some geometric figure, a symmetry is an action after which the figure is not displaced (e.g. it can fit into the same mold that it fit before the action was applied).</p>

<p>We wonâ€™t use the balls this time, as they have just one position just one action - the identity action (which is itâ€™s own reverse by the way). So letâ€™s take this triangle (which for our purposes, is the same as any other triangle).</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_group.svg" alt="A triangle"></p>

<h2 id="groups-of-rotations">Groups of rotations</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s first review the group of ways in which we can rotate our triangle i.e. its <em>rotation group</em>. A geometric figure can be rotated without displacement in positions equal to the number of its sides, so for our triangle there are 3 positions.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a triangle"></p>

<p>Connecting the dots (or the triangles in this case) shows us that there are just two possible actions that get us from any state to any other one - a <em>120-degree rotation</em> (i.e. flipping the triangle one time) and a <em>240-degree rotation</em> (i.e. flipping it two times (or equivalently, flipping it once, but in the opposite direction)). Adding the identity action of 0-degree rotation makes up for 3 actions in total.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation_actions.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a triangle"></p>

<h2 id="cyclic-groupsmonoids">Cyclic groups/monoids</h2>

<p>Ennumerating all the rotations of a more complex geometrical figure looks quite messy at first.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation_square.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a more complex figure"></p>

<p>But itâ€™s much simpler to grasp if we notice the following: although our group has many actions, and there are more still for figures with more sides (if I am not mistaken, the number of actions is equal to the number of the sides), all of those actions can be reduced to the repetitive application of just the simplest action, (the 120-degree rotation for triangles and the 30-degree rotation for octagons). Letâ€™s make up a symbol for this rotation.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation_cyclic.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a triangle"></p>

<p>Groups and monoids that have this â€œmainâ€� action (called a â€œgeneratorâ€�) which when applied enough times can get you to any state that which is <em>cyclic groups</em>. All rotation groups are cyclic groups. Another example of a cyclic groups is, yes, the integers under addition. Here we can use <strong>+1</strong> or <strong>-1</strong> as generators.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/numbers_cyclic.svg" alt="The group of numbers under addition"></p>

<p>Wait, how can this be a cyclic group when there are no cycles? This is because the …</p></div></div>

<p>Raspberry Pi 400 has sufficient power to run full-featured microservices written in Swift. Running Swift (together with MongoDB) on such a small gadget is serious fun!</p>

<p>I’ve tested this setup on Raspberry PI 400 which has a quad core processor, 4 GB of RAM and a speedy USB 3.0 SSD, however the instructions below are not limited only to this device. <br>
Even though base configuration was not overclocked, I’ve managed to run simple <a href="http://vapor.codes/">Vapor-based microservice</a>, and achieve over 10 000 req/sec on this little piece of silicon!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcinkliks.pl/uploads/pi-10k-24fa0e.png" width="800"></p>

<h2 id="installing-swift-on-rasperry-pi">Installing Swift on Rasperry PI</h2>

<p>If you want to use the latest Vapor 4, you need to upgrade Raspberry PI OS to 64 bits. Otherwise, this step may be skipped.</p>

<p>Ideal setup, as of 01/2020 is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swift 5.3.1</li>
  <li>MongoDB 4.9.0</li>
  <li>Nginx</li>
</ul>

<p>For IDE we will use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio Code 1.52.1 (latest current version)</li>
  <li>sourcekit-lsp trunk (revision:6eb17c9a7bc00bec83d57d2399ba9f5ab14d3bcc )</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upgrading-to-rasperry-pi-os-64-bit">Upgrading to Rasperry PI OS 64 bit</h2>

<p>Swift ARM builds are available here: <a href="https://packagecloud.io/swift-arm/release">https://packagecloud.io/swift-arm/release</a>. 
Unfortunatelly, the latest version for Rasperry PI OS (default distribution) is 5.1.3 and it’s not usable with the latest Vapor 4 version. We need to upgrade the operating system to 64 bits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the beta version of Rasperry PI OS 64 bit <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1668160">here</a> if you need the latest Swift.</li>
  <li>Install swift package from packagecloud.io <code>https://packagecloud.io/swift-arm/release/packages/debian/buster/swiftlang_5.3.1-3-debian-buster_arm64.deb</code> with <code>dpkg -i</code></li>
  <li>Swift REPL is not usable at the moment, but it’s not a big deal so don’t worry.</li>
  <li>Swap file. Swift needs a lot of memory during the compilation, so let’s find a spare SSD drive, and create some fast swap files, at least 5 GB.
    <div><div><pre><code>swapoff <span>-a</span>
<span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/media/[yourssd]/swap <span>ibs</span><span>=</span>1M <span>obs</span><span>=</span>1M <span>count</span><span>=</span>5000
mkswap /media/[yourssd]/swap
swapon /media/[yourssd]/swap
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>That’s it. Test if your code compiles. Vapor 4 should run just fine!
    <div><div><pre><code>swift package init <span>--type</span> executable
swift build
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ide-on-raspberry-pi-with-visual-studio-code-lsp-and-swift">IDE on Raspberry PI with Visual Studio Code, LSP and Swift</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Install ARM64 DEB package from Visual Studio Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a></li>
  <li>You need this package: <code>https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp</code> to use the Auto-Completion functionality in Visual Studio Code, because version 5.3.1 is unusably slow. The new version is 10 times more performant. We will compile it from sources using this documentation <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/blob/main/Documentation/Development.md">here</a>. 
This will work for arm64:</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code>swift build -c release -Xcxx -I/usr/lib/swift -Xcxx -I/usr/lib/swift/Block
cp .build/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/sourcekit-lsp /usr/local/bin/sourcekit-lsp

apt-get install npm
cd Editors/vscode
npm run createDevPackage
code --install-extension ./out/sourcekit-lsp-vscode-dev.vsix
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After installation, every feature should work well, including: autocompletion, fix-its, documentation, go to definition.
If not, it’s probably because of the internal card speed - see below how to improve the performance by a factor of 10.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>

<p>SD cards tend to be slow. I recommend to either boot from an SSD entirely, or boot from an SD card, but in this case move the essential data to faster drive. It makes a huge difference during development.</p>

<p><strong>Directories to move to external faster drive:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>~/.config/Code <span>(</span><span>for </span>Visual Studio Code<span>)</span>
~/.cache  <span>(</span><span>for </span>various developmnt tasks<span>)</span>
/tmp <span>(</span>e.g. lsp cache<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can tune your system for maximum performance:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
echo performance &gt; cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu2/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu3/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu4/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="mongodb-on-raspberry-pi">MongoDB on Raspberry PI</h2>

<p>Ok, this is an optional step. Chances are, your microservice needs a database, such as MongoDB. Yes, it works just fine, but you need to compile it from sources.</p>

<p>You need at least 20 GB of free space for compilation. Compilation will take at least 5-10 hours.</p>

<p>We will compile as usual using <code>https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/docs/building.md</code>, but have to provide additional flag since there are problems with crc32 because of missing instructions. <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-30893">More information here</a></p>

<p>Using flag <code>--use-hardware-crc32=off</code> will compile it fine. Full script should look similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git

python3 <span>-m</span> vevn virtualenv
<span>source </span>virtualenv/bin/activate

python3 buildscripts/scons.py install-mongod <span>--disable-warnings-as-errors</span> <span>--use-hardware-crc32</span><span>=</span>off

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Congratulations, after 5-10 hours, you will get the 4,2 GB binary file called <code>mongodb</code>. It’s time to strip it to just ~40 MB with the instructions below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>root@raspberrypi:/media/pi/rpi/mongo# <span>ls </span>build/install/bin/mongod
build/install/bin/mongod

root@raspberrypi:/media/pi/rpi/mongo# strip build/install/bin/mongod
root@raspberrypi:/media/pi/rpi/mongo# <span>cp </span>build/install/bin/mongod /usr/local/bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now it’s time to prepare a storage space for a database and logs. Use your external drive and mount it somewhere. E.g. create <code>mongo-data</code> and <code>mongo-logs</code> directories, and use the following configuration files as examples.
I used the simplest configuration possible. I recommend changing the default user <code>pi</code>, for security reasons.</p>

<div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/Italianauthority">Italian authority</a> has blocked certain users from accessing TikTok. Users, who can’t definitely verify their age after the tragic death of a young girl who is taking part in a “blackout challenge”, from accessing Tiktok.</p>
<p>This girl’s death was firstly reported by ANSA on Thursday when it happened.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<p>A Italian girl,10, was pronounced brain dead by a Palermo hospital on Thursday after she took the Blackout Challenge on TikTok.</p>
<p>Her parents have accepted to donate the organs of the girl, who tied a belt round her neck to self-asphyxiate in the challenge on Tiktok.</p>
<p>Read also: <strong><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tiktok-star-tony-lopez-sued-for-sexual-battery/">TikTok Star, Tony Lopez Sued For Sexual Battery</a></strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/23/italy-blocks-tiktok-for-certain-users-after-death-of-girl-allegedly-playing-choking-game#:~:text=Italian%20prosecutors%20have%20opened%20an,could%20not%20be%20proved%20definitively." target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a>, an investigation has been opened by Italian prosecutors , and Italy has temporarily blocked users from gaining access to the popular social platform “whose age couldn’t be verified.”</p>
<p>TikTok had reported that it has not discovered any content on its site that may have persuaded the girl to participate in the challenge, but was assisting the authorities in probing the incident.</p>
<p>A Tiktok spokesperson said: “The safety of the TikTok community is our absolute priority, for this reason we do not allow any content which encourages, promotes or glorifies behavior that could be dangerous”</p>
<p>The report shows that the Italian Data Protection Authority had blocked TikTok till February 15th immediately till regulator’s demands are met. This challenge being referred to was also reportedly called “scarfing” or “the choking game”, involving participants blocking oxygen to their brain in order to get high. The girl’s parents told La Repubblica that they are not aware of the game and only aware of their daughter going on TikTok for dances, and to watch videos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When they came to him, straightway he cast the serpent into the deep sea, where he lies about all the land; and this serpent grew so greatly that he lies in the midst of the ocean encompassing all the land, and bites upon his own tail.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>– Snorri Sturluson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me begin with a throat clearing. I’m all for free (as in free speech) software. I have contributed, in small ways at least, to free &amp; open source projects, I admire many of its proponents &amp; contributors &amp; am increasingly trading out proprietary tools &amp; services for free ones. The <a href="https://github.com/erwald/blog">code for this website</a> is free. Nearly every other software project I have undertaken privately is also free. I think that <a href="https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/evolution-of-programming-language-traits/">making software free is good for innovation</a>. It’s good for programmers. It’s good for people. It’s the kind of thing that everybody can get behind.</p>
<p>But (&amp; you knew there was going to be a “but”) the philosophy that Richard Stallman presents in <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.en.html">Why Software Should Be Free</a></em> goes too far for me. It goes so far that it bends into a circle &amp; eats its own tail, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr">the world-serpent of the Norse sagas</a>. That is to say, there is a contradiction at its heart, precisely where its theory meets its praxis.</p>
<p>I will explain what I mean by that soon enough. But first I will try to summarise Stallman’s argument as clearly &amp; sympathetically as I can. The argument goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>When somebody has tailored themselves a jacket, they own that jacket. They are justified in controlling it because if they were not, somebody else could do something with it which would be bad for its owner, or somebody else could steal it which, again, would be bad for its owner as it would deprive them of a jacket. The same isn’t true for software. If someone copies your program, you still have your program. If someone modifies the copy, your program is still unmodified.</li>
<li>Hence no creator is justified, when their created thing is immaterial, in controlling that thing. The two are separate from one another. The creator is entitled to credit &amp; gratitude for their work but they are not – no matter how much time, skill or effort was involved in creating it – justified in controlling its spread or use.</li>
<li>Proprietary software is like private roads. Free software is like public roads. Either we could have a world where all roads are privately built &amp; funded by tolls, such that private actors would be incentivised to build roads because they profit directly from it; or we could have a world where all roads are publicly funded &amp; freely available to whoever wishes to use them. The latter is more beneficial to society &amp; less costly for it.</li>
<li>The utility of allowing free access to a program is greater than that of restricting access to it, which in fact causes harm, e.g. by preventing others from learning about it, by preventing them from building on it, by reducing innovation or by damaging social cohesion. Therefore, each person is not only justified but even obliged to spread programs freely, no matter who created them. Because this is what will maximise utility for those who use programs. As Stallman writes:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that both you and your neighbor would find it useful to run a certain program. In ethical concern for your neighbor, you should feel that proper handling of the situation will enable both of you to use it. A proposal to permit only one of you to use the program, while restraining the other, is divisive; neither you nor your neighbor should find it acceptable.</p>
<p>Signing a typical software license agreement means betraying your neighbor: “I promise to deprive my neighbor of this program so that I can have a copy for myself.” People who make such choices feel internal psychological pressure to justify them, by downgrading the importance of helping one’s neighbors – thus public spirit suffers. […]</p>
<p>Many users unconsciously recognize the wrong of refusing to share, so they decide to ignore the licenses and laws, and share programs anyway. But they often feel guilty about doing so. They know that they must break the laws in order to be good neighbors, but they still consider the laws authoritative, and they conclude that being a good neighbor (which they are) is naughty or shameful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s important to distinguish between two senses of ownership here. The first is that of exerting control over a thing. The second is that of benefitting somehow, in a privileged way, from a thing. Stallman argues that the first is not only wrong but even incoherent in a way, since there can be no owner of software in that way. From what I can tell, Stallman is fine with a programmer benefitting from the programs they write. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We thus have a paradox: the developer of useful software is entitled to the support of the users, but any attempt to turn this moral obligation into a requirement destroys the basis for the obligation. A developer can either deserve a reward or demand it, but not both.</p>
<p>I believe that an ethical developer faced with this paradox must act so as to deserve the reward, but should also entreat the users for voluntary donations. Eventually the users will learn to support developers without coercion, just as they have learned to support public radio and television stations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, he seems to think that it’s only fine to the extent that benefitting is divorced from exerting control, viz. when the programmer benefits passively but doesn’t restrict their program in order to do so. I think this is somewhat disingenuous because recognising that the programmer is justified in benefitting passively from a program they wrote means recognising that the program they wrote is “tethered” to them in some way. It means that their having written the program gives them some rights with regard to it (specifically, the right to benefit from it). But if <em>that’s</em> true, there is reason to believe also that their having written the program gives them some rights to control it, which Stallman denies.</p>
<p>That’s not normally how we think about these things. We usually think whoever comes up with a new thing <em>is</em> justified in acting to benefit from it. Imagine a nobody approaches a Hollywood studio executive with an idea for a movie. The person is rebuffed but the studio goes on to make the movie anyway: it is a huge box office success. The person sees none of the money. Doesn’t it seem like the studio executive wronged that person? Like they used that person as a mere means to further their own ends? Under Stallman’s view there’d be nothing wrong with this; under his view, the only thing that’d be wrong is if the person had then decided to sue the studio for damages.</p>
<p>But let’s say, for the sake of argument, that Stallman can smoothen out that friction. Let’s say that the scenario with the studio executive <a href="https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/tolstoy-in-ryazan/">seems wrong intuitively</a> but is not wrong upon deliberation. Stallman holds that it is wrong to exert control over a program once you’ve written it. But the GNU General Public License (which I like) does exactly this. It restricts people in the way that they use the licensed program. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL-3</a>, the latest of them, does this in a variety of ways, by requiring the user to:</p>
<ul>
<li>include information about where to find the original software,</li>
<li>include information about how the software has been modified,</li>
<li>include installation instructions,</li>
<li>retain the GPL-3 license &amp;</li>
<li>retain the original copyright.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are ways in which the owner, who selected the license, exerts control over the program &amp; the user, who is bound by it. In other words, GPL-3 &amp; its ancestor licenses recognise the creator’s right to a measure of control over the thing they created even after it’s out there in the world. That makes some of Stallman’s arguments, such as the example of the neighbours that I quoted earlier, sound almost incoherent.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Thus the world-serpent bites its own tail.</p>
<p>There’s now no room for defence left on any ground outside utilitarianism. Ownership of a program is only bad to the extent that it produces bad outcomes; &amp; it is also good to the extent that it produces good outcomes. But there’s nothing inherently bad or incoherent about it. Stallman does speak of consequences &amp; cost-benefit analyses. Personally, I am neither a consequentialist nor a utilitarian. I am a Kantian, I think. I am, however, willing to consider utilitarian arguments. But in my opinion the argument from pure utilitarianism is not nearly strong enough to support the sort of conclusions that Stallman draws, such as that one is obliged to share a program with those who want it against the wishes of its creator. And I think no full account of software can be made without really considering which duties we have towards those who create it.</p>

</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The example of the neighbours is a little strange in that it only seems to consider the utility of the neighbours &amp; not that of the creator of the program. I think that’s because, in Stallman’s view, there’s no such thing as an owner, so the creator has no rights over the program. This muddles things up a bit because it’s no longer a universal utilitarian argument.</p>
<p>One could argue against the example of the neighbours on consequentialist grounds. For instance, it could deprive the creator of monetary compensation, or it could create risks for them, e.g. from the neighbour’s using the program for something immoral, causing the creator to become associated with that immoral act.</p>
<p>But it would be hard to think of this reading Stallman’s presentation of the example because it magics away the programmer who wrote the program &amp; human agency generally. Hence he writes that “proper handling of the situation will enable both of you to use it” &amp; that “[a] proposal to permit only one of you to use [it] is divisive”. The acting agents here are a “proper handling” &amp; a “proposal”. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here’s a thing I don’t see appreciated enough about Rust: <code>loop</code>.
I know I don’t think about it all that much,
but pretty much every time I use it I feel a bit of satisfaction.</p>

<p><code>loop</code> is just an unconditional loop:
it loops forever, or until you write <code>break</code>, or <code>return</code>.</p>

<p>Most languages don’t have it.</p>

<p>Instead, loop constructs usually have some kind of termination condition,
your <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops.
Apparently <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sather">Sather</a></em> has an unconditional <code>loop</code> keyword like Rust.
I only know this because a programming language historian mentioned it <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906#issuecomment-4240501">on the bug tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Why do I love <code>loop</code>?</p>

<p>Because it frees me from thinking about how to end a loop
before I’ve even started writing it.</p>

<p>Many problems are easy to recognize as ones that require a looping solution:
I quickly realize, “I have to do something multiple times”.</p>

<p>Sometimes that loop just involves iterating over a container of things,
one at a time.
That’s easy to recognize as a <code>for thing in things { }</code> situation.
Other loops have more complex conditions though.
Often when I’m solving a looping problem,
I will know one or some of the steps I intend to do in a loop,
but will not envision the complete solution ahead of time.</p>

<p>So I just write</p>



<p>and start coding what I do know needs to happen,
and work from there.</p>

<p>For some reason this feels great.</p>

<p>Once I have solved my looping problem,
there will be a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> somewhere in there,
or multiple <code>break</code>s and/or <code>return</code>s.
Maybe it makes sense to convert it into a <code>while</code> loop,
maybe not. But there’s not a great need
for <code>while</code> when you’ve got <code>loop</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>return</code>.
Do readers really need to know the loop termination condition
before reading what happens in the loop?
Or, in languages with <code>do { } while (…)</code> loops,
after the very end of the loop?
I don’t know,
but writing the termination condition
naturally wherever it “wants” to live in the loop
seems reasonable to me.
One does though need to be considerate of
their readers by keeping the loop body a readable length.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, a small project I’m working on right now
contains 2 instances of <code>loop</code>, 2 of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/while_let.html"><code>while let</code></a>,
and 8 of <code>for … in</code>;
no standard <code>while</code> loops.
And I think the <code>loop</code> loops read better than if I had
tried to convert them to <code>while</code> loops.</p>

<p>Here’s one example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>async_channel</span><span>::</span><span>unbounded</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>FsThreadContext</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>block_on</span><span>(</span><span>rx</span><span>.recv</span><span>())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"recv"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>msg</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>context</span><span>);</span>
            <span>},</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Shutdown</span><span>(</span><span>rsp_tx</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>context</span><span>.shutdown</span><span>();</span>
                <span>rsp_tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"send"</span><span>);</span>
                <span>break</span><span>;</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the other:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>header</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>line</span><span>.truncate</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>line</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>line</span><span>.is_empty</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"broken frame header"</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>[</span><span>..</span><span>line</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>];</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>==</span> <span>FRAME_BODY_MARKER</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>header</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s common in C-like languages to write an unconditional loop
with <code>while (true) { }</code>.</p>

<p>I’m steeped enough in Rust that I don’t know if writing <code>while (true) { }</code>
brings others the same satisfaction as I get from <code>loop { }</code>,
but I suspect not: it looks and feels just like a tiny bit of a hack.
And if I go into writing a loop by first writing <code>while …</code>
then I am immediately presented with the question,
“while <em>what</em>?”,
and sometimes I just don’t want to think about that yet.</p>

<p>Besides <em>feeling</em> good,
there is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">a technical reason that Rust has <code>loop</code></a>:
it helps analyze control flow.
With it, the compiler can trivially know that any code
after the loop is unreachable.
In Rust at least this is important for type checking.
This kind of analysis <em>is done</em> in other languages,
but by my recollection they sometimes actually
special case <code>while (true) { }</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the differences in how Rust
treats <code>loop</code> vs. <code>while true</code> <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=010dce12fdd4c0818322717e161a2f91">on the playground</a>.
Run it and check out the warning the compiler
issues; try to alter the example as suggested in the comments.</p>

<p>Bonus Rust trivia:
did you know that <code>loop</code> is an expression,
with the same type as its <code>break</code> statements,
and the result of <code>loop</code> can be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html#break-and-loop-values">assigned to a value</a>?</p>

<p>I did not!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">issue on the bug tracker</a> appears
to be the only remains of the design discussion around <code>loop</code> in Rust,
though it is insightful to the designers’ original thinking.
The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/weekly-meetings/2012-03-06.md">meeting minutes</a> where it was approved
just say there was consensus to add it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Unconditional loops are unconditionally awesome"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>X2GO is one of the easiest open source remote access applications to  install on Linux, including on the Raspberry Pi 3B/4B. If the host is  LinuxMint and the client is a Raspberry PI, you can have both the  LinuxMint panel on the bottom of the client screen as well as the  Rasbian panel on the top of the screen – that way you can run both  local and remote apps at the same time in a split screen,  or even full screen  on separate client  monitors, or x2go client window spanning both monitors.</p>



<p>The x2goserver can handle multiple  simultaneous client computers with distinct usernames and their home  directories – rather like thin clients without PXE booting. X2GO is not   integrated into the loginctl multi-seat system but functions beside  that capability. Thus the multi-seat behavior of the client is handled by the x2goserver but initiated by the x2go client,&nbsp; not the&nbsp; host side that loginctl controls. The Raspberry Pi 4B is fast enough to be used as a full desktop and supports two HDMI monitors. It only needs to become an x2go client of an x2go server when it needs more computing power or to save files. Its window on the server can span both monitors, or stay on one of the monitors so that the user can run apps both locally and remotely on the server at the same time, moving the mouse to control which desktop the keyboard is connected to.</p>



<p>While there is a x2goclient for Windows computers, there is no  x2goserver for Windows computers.  Supporting multiple independent client sessions would violate a  Windows single workstation license. The Windows malware problem can be  solved by running Windows as a guest OS under VirtualBox on a Linux  host server. Then there is no need for the Windows OS to be connected to the  internet because you can use the browser on the Raspbian local client desktop  when needed.</p>



<p>If multiple  network cards on the x2goserver, the default is to  listen on all for clients. With lots of simultaneous clients, you might want to configure the server to separate server internet traffic from  client traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Installation of server on Linux Mint 19:</strong></p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo apt-get install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession
[sudo] password for (username):

... skipping output during installation process ...
 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo service x2goserver start
[sudo] password for (username): 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$
</pre>



<p>or, alternatively,</p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$
asm32@M5A88-M:~$sudo systemctl start x2goserver
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<p>To make it start automatically on boot:</p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo update-rc.d x2goserver defaults
[sudo] password for asm32: 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<p><strong>Installation of client on Raspberry Pi3 B+&nbsp; running <strong>Raspberry Pi OS</strong></strong> <strong>with Desktop:</strong></p>



<p>x2goclient is already in the Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi OS&nbsp; repository, so all that is needed is</p>



<pre>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install x2goclient</pre>



<p>Once installed, there will be a new menu item under Internet category.</p>



<p>When configuring x2goclient sessions, you can use server hostnames instead of IP addresses. There can be more than one server on a LAN but hostnames must be unique.</p>



<p><strong>X2goclient as Raspberry Pi software zeroclient!</strong></p>



<div><p>A new raspberry pi is approximately 1/3 the cost of a new network attached zero client. Raspberry Pi could be configured to initiate an x2goclient session immediately, much like a hardware zero client, with the difference  that the x2go client provides the login screen instead of the server. </p><p>You will want to install the perl script, wakeonlan, so that you can wake up the desktop server from any of the Pi zero clients. I have edited my version so that the desired server MAC address is in the script instead of needed on the command line or in a separate file.</p></div>



<p>While x2goclient is trivial to install on a Raspberry Pi with a desktop environment, for a single purpose network attached zero client, it is not required to have a windows manager and desktop environment so you could use the <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite</strong> image at 432 MB (compared to the desktop version at 1128 MB).</p>



<p>Download here: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/"><strong>https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/</strong></a></p>



<p>Once you have downloaded and flashed a MicroSD card with this and done the initial configuration at first boot on the Raspberry Pi, add the following:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg</code></pre>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xinit</code></pre>



<div><p>To start up the xserver automatically, edit the file .bashrc to append the line “/usr/bin/startx” without the quotes.</p><p>Next edit the file .xinitrc to delete or make a comment the line “. /etc/X11/Xsession” and append a new line ” /usr/bin/x2goclient –thinclient –session=session-name” without the quotes. The second option launches a named session that you have setup already. Leave this option off if you have more than one server and the user needs to choose a session. If you have more than one user, you should not fill in the user name for the session. If you have only one server and one user (you are using this to remotely administer the server, perhaps) then you can set up automatic login so that the Raspberry Pi boots directly to a desktop of the remote server computer.</p></div>



<p><strong>Auto login with ssh rsa</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="570" src="http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-1024x570.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-1024x570.jpg 1024w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-300x167.jpg 300w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-768x427.jpg 768w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-1536x854.jpg 1536w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin.jpg 1812w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></figure>



<div><p>Assuming you already have a x2go session working with login, several things in the x2go session are needed for auto login to work. You most have a username (server end) or it will not know where to look for the authorized public key on the server end. It is preferable to check the box for “Try auto login” and leave the path entry  just above empty so that it will use the default location.  There can be multiple authorized public keys on the server – it will look for the one matching the client private key. There can also be multiple client sessions, each with a different private key. It is the client end (at possibly multiple separate workstations) that initiates the conversation with the server.</p><p><strong>Setting up private and public keys</strong></p></div>



<pre>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $</pre>



<p>Having generated these keys at the client end, they need to be installed at both ends. In my case asm32@asus-centos7 is my username on my server hostname.</p>



<pre>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh-copy-id asm32@asus-centos7

Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'asm32@asus-centos7'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh 'asm32@asus-centos7'

[asm32@asus-centos7 ~]$ ls -l .ssh/

-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 444 Jul 12 17:55 known_hosts
pi@raspberrypi:~ $</pre>



<p>Note that after the client end command,  ssh-copy-id,  the public key has been added to the server end .ssh/authorized_keys and the client end now has a .ssh/known_hosts.</p>



<p>The right panel of x2goclient has all the sessions you have configured. When you select one of these, it will move to the blue left panel. With auto login, it will immediately start to connect to the server.  If you leave it in the left panel when you exit the session, then the next invocation of x2goclient will immediately attempt to connect to the server. In the case of a <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite</strong> installation as described above, the Pi will boot directly into connecting to its configured session on the server – similar to the Phistek ZE7000 network attached zero client at less than 1/3 the hardware cost.</p>



<p>The Phistek ZE7000 has superior video performance. Its silicon USB over IP chip is transmitting compressed USB over IP protocol, whereas the x2go method is transmitting compressed X protocol graphic primitives which is more efficient for non video applications.</p>

Why? So far as I can tell, it’s because I’ve been using Facebook to advocate for decentralization of social media. And apparently the algorithm didn’t like that.</p> <p>This morning, sometime between 8:54am and 9:06am Mountain, Facebook disabled my account. Just after 8:54am, I copy-pasted the content of my latest Twitter post into a new post on Facebook. At 9:06am, a friend received a Facebook notification indicating that he needed to update his trusted contacts because I was no longer available. Here’s the exact text and link that I posted to both Twitter and Facebook:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks. The future of humanity depends on it. Ben Goertzel gets it right. Read his explanation. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1352645833569669121">22 January 2021</a>)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks.

I was able to login. But I wasn’t able to see anything except the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Your Account Has Been Disabled. For more information please visit the Help Center. Your account was disabled on Jan 22, 2021. If you think your account was disabled by mistake you can submit more information via the Help Center for up to 30 days after your account was disabled. After that, your account will be permanently disabled and you will no longer be able to request a review.”</p> </blockquote> <figure><span><img src="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-11.04.16-am.jpg" alt="Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain"></span><figcaption>Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain</figcaption></figure> <p>I clicked on a link at the end of the message. It took me to the Help Center. There I found a link to request a review. Clicking on that link took me to a form which requested my full name and photo ID.</p> <p>I filled out the form, providing my name and a JPG of my government issued ID. Then I submitted the form. In response, I received the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We Cannot Review the Decision to Disable Your Account. Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. This decision can’t be reversed.”</p> </blockquote> <figure><span><img src="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-9.26.23-am.jpg" alt="Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain"></span><figcaption>Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="why-facebook-disabled-my-account">Why Facebook Disabled My Account</h2> <p>I don’t know for sure why Facebook disabled my account. I didn’t receive an explanation. There was no reference to particular Facebook Community Standards that I might have broken. There was no indication of how I might have been violating Facebook’s terms of service.</p> <p>Moreover, I have never received a warning from Facebook. And I didn’t receive a warning today. They provided no information beyond what I’ve quoted above.</p> <p>I’ve never used Facebook or any other social media to advocate violence, political or otherwise. And I’m a political centrist. In fact, during the political controversies of 2020, I repeatedly insisted on civility to such an extent that it frustrated some of my more partisan friends. So we can’t plausibly look for an explanation there.</p> <p>We could imagine a conspiracy among people who dislike my religious views. There’s plenty of <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2018/09/this-post-is-brought-to-you-by.html">strong anti-Mormon and anti-Transhumanist sentiment</a> out there. Perhaps, banding together, a group of people reported or otherwise flagged my content on Facebook as inappropriate. But this seems a bit paranoid to me.</p> <p>I don’t think the cause was the link that I shared, in itself. Quite a few other people have shared that link on Facebook. In fact, at this moment, their API indicates that <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fdecentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">the link has received at least 88 likes, shares, and comments across Facebook</a>. And that number has been increasing throughout the day without Facebook banning others for it, to the best of my knowledge.</p> <p>So I think the cause must have been the comment itself. Or, more generally, it may have been an emerging pattern in the comments of my posts. For a long time, I have advocated replacing Facebook with <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2015/05/the-reputation-web.html">decentralized social networks</a>. And current events have motivated me to increase the frequency of that advocacy.</p> <p>Several times over the last week or two, I have promoted decentralization in posts to both Facebook and Twitter. The content and links of the original posts were identical on the two platforms. So you can see them on my Twitter account. For easy reference, here are copies of my most recent cross-posts in reverse chronological order (as ordered on Twitter and previously on Facebook):</p> <ul> <li> <p>“Congratulations to President Biden and Vice-President Harris. May your term in office be peaceful and prosperous, for the United States of America and for our world.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351953891655520258">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“The debate between capitalism and socialism is often framed as a choice between large corporations and large government. This framing is cultivated by political and economic elites. The truth is that there’s an alternative to both. Limit both. Decentralize ALL power.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351914808753307649">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“In a recent discussion with the Christian Transhumanist Association, I presented and answered questions about the New God Argument. Here’s a recording. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351384453231230976">18 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Decentralization is a practical necessity. For Christians, it’s also a theological mandate. Essential to the Gospel is a transformative discipleship, wherein we each participate in the role of Christ and become joint heirs in the glory of God. Divine creation IS decentralization.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350943723908198406">17 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“If God ensures the right spirit is associated with the right body during human-mediated procreation, why wouldn’t God ensure the same for human-mediated resurrection? If you build it, they will come. If they don’t come, you didn’t build it right. Seems straightforward to me.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350259207107317760">15 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“‘The long view is a thriving decentralized marketplace, fueled by personal empowerment and collaboration.’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348662980175564802">11 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Let’s say you have enough spare cash to buy a gun, donate to a charity, or invest in some Bitcoin. What do you do and why? What does your choice say about your vision of the future? How does your choice impinge on the creation of that future?” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348082874239524865">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter. That may or may not be comparatively fair. But if it constitutes an infringement on freedom of speech then we’ve given far too much power to Facebook and Twitter. Centrally controlled freedom of speech should terrify us.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1347931805370863617">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, on 13 January 2021, I shared to Facebook some thoughts in support of a tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. I can no longer quote the text from my Facebook post because it wasn’t a cross-post like the others. But it essentially affirmed Jack Dorsey’s interest in supporting decentralized social media, as he expressed in a recent tweet:</p> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bluesky</a>: <a href="https://t.co/51or6OuNNv">https://t.co/51or6OuNNv</a></p>— jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>As you can see, almost all of my recent social media posts have been related to decentralization. Even the ones that aren’t obviously related to decentralization are still implicitly or indirectly related to decentralization. For example, decentralization is an important aspect of the <a href="https://new-god-argument.com/compassion-argument.html">Compassion Argument of the New God Argument</a>. And a theology that would include <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2019/04/how-to-raise-dead.html">human action toward resurrection</a> as an expression of God’s work is a decentralized theology.</p> <p>A machine learning algorithm would be capable of identifying accounts that publish posts with a pattern of negative sentiment toward centralized social media. The algorithm could also assign a score to the degree of negative sentiment. And Facebook could use that score to trigger automatic deactivation of accounts that surpass a relatively high score. None of this would require direct human intervention.</p> <p>Again, I don’t know for sure why Facebook deactivated my account. But based on what I know, I think the best explanation is that Facebook now implicitly hates decentralization. I suspect that one of its algorithms is checking for accounts that encourage use of alternative social networks. And it caught my account in its automated net.</p> <p>As an aside, perhaps some Facebook managers and engineers originally intended the algorithm to catch accounts that encourage use of social networks that focus on controversial politics. That seems possible. I’ve neither advocated for nor participated in those social networks. But I can see how my posts might have some syntactical commonalities with posts that advocate for those social networks.</p> <h2 id="why-facebook-doesnt-ban-everyone">Why Facebook Doesn’t Ban Everyone</h2> <p>Aren’t other people advocating for decentralized social networks without being banned? Maybe so. But the algorithm may have identified my account as a particularly useful target. Here’s why.</p> <p>Social network theory categorizes people according to how they function in networks. Some people are influencers within groups of similar persons. Some people are followers within groups. And some people are connectors between groups.</p> <p>Connectors facilitate transmission of ideas between dissimilar groups. Transmission of ideas can be good, promoting adaptability over time and creation of new value. But transmission of ideas can also be bad insofar as they undermine the coherence and survival of the group or system. All groups and systems, even the most creative, require a balance.</p> <p>As it turns out, my social connections are unusually diverse. For example, I have many politically progressive and many politically conservative connections. I have many religious, secular, and atheist connections. And these connections include many influencers in a wide variety of geographies around the world.</p> <p>I’m a connector. I …</p></div></div>

    <p>Recent events have made me reflect on a few things in my life I was already thinking about for a while. Also, responses on social media have made me realize that people have <em>strange</em> expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.</p>

<h2 id="growth">growth</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has grown a lot since I started contributing to it in 2011. Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one runing a 600 billion dollar system. Market cap is famously deceptive, but my point is not about specific numbers here.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: this is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">moving on</h2>

<p>I realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.</p>

<h2 id="spreading-out">spreading out</h2>

<p>I will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role.</p>

<p>Note that we had a nice growth in development activity, and that maintenance of the code itself has already been spread over multiple people for a while. I’m not the most active maintainer. Looking at the number of git merges</p>

     65 Samuel Dobson
    363 Wladimir J. van der Laan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Only about 24% of the merges were done by me, last year.</p>

<h2 id="plans">plans</h2>

<p>But there’s plenty of things left to figure out, from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize distribution.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the short run, transfer bitcoincore.org to an organization instead of private ownership. Reduce the “bus factor”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think it would be good if some other organizations set up mirrors, so there is less incentive to try to take bitcoincore.org down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the long run, move away from a website for code distribution completely. No matter who owns it, a website on the clearnet can be shut down with the press of a button, and it seems that the global internet is gearing up to make censorship increasingly easy. We need a decentralized web. For us, one option would be IPFS, which is starting to catch on. For the binaries themselves there’s already the option of downloading through torrents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the release process, and release signing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Delegate more parts of the release process. Other maintainers should be able to do a release without my involvement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename the GPG key used to sign <code>SHA256SUMS.asc</code> to “Bitcoin Core release signing key”, instead of having it in my personal title. Make some construct so that N of M (minimally) trusted gitian signers doing a succesful build automatically results in a signed distribution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Same for the native code signing for Windows and MacOS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even better in the long run would be to split up the keys, e.g. though RSA threshold signing, so that the whole process is geographically distributed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the development hub.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It’s not clear whether github can be trusted to act in our interest in the long run. Although issues and PRs are backed up through the API, having to move somewhere else could give significant interruption in development. And hopping from provider to provider would be awful—ideally the whole thing would not rely on a central server <em>at all</em>. For this I’ve been watching the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">radicle</a> project, a P2P distributed code collaboration platform. It’s not quite there yet, but seems promising.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin is quite different in some of the requirements here from other FOSS projects, so we’ll have to develop some tools as we go. We could also, definitely, use some help here.</p>

<p>Some smaller things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find someone else who wants to do the IRC meeting chair instead of me. Or maybe rotate it between multiple people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Release (and release candidate) mails to the <code>bitcoin-dev</code> and <code>bitcoin-core-dev</code> lists will no longer be necessarily signed and sent by me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s some development specific tooling hosted by me (e.g. the PR notification bots on IRC and mastodon). As they are non-critical and only little time goes into maintaining them, I’m fine with this for now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for decentralizing Bitcoin’s node software itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carl Dong’s <code>libbitcoin_kernel</code> work. Bitcoin Core is a large monolithic project which includes the consensus code, which is much more critical than the other parts. The kernel would be an isolated part with well-defined interface, and at some point, its own review flow for changes. The difference with previous <code>libbitcoin_consensus</code> plans is that the kernel is stateful: it includes UTXO management and validation. It however does not include P2P, mempool policy, wallet, GUI, and RPC code. It could be re-used in different clients, to have more diversity in clients, but without the risks of a deviating consensus implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of 2021 this will be my focus with regard to Bitcoin Core.</p>

<![CDATA[WhatsApp facing up to €50M privacy fine]]>

January 23, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp could be fined up to €50 million over violations of the European Union's data protection rules, according to three people with direct knowledge of the procedure who spoke with POLITICO.</p>
<p>The preliminary penalty — the figure is now under consultation with the bloc's other data protection agencies — would be one of the largest-ever fines under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, a set of privacy rules that came into force in 2018. </p>
<p>As part of Ireland's draft findings, the internet messenger may face a fine of between €30 million and €50 million for not living up to transparency requirements under Europe's privacy regime. Whatsapp could also be required to change how it handles its users' data, as the case relates to how the messenger may have failed to properly inform its EU users about how it would share their data with Facebook.</p>

<p>France's privacy authority <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cnils-restricted-committee-imposes-financial-penalty-50-million-euros-against-google-llc" target="_blank">has fined</a> Google €50 million for separate privacy violations, while Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which has regulatory authority over Facebook, recently <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-data-regulator-fines-twitter-e450000/">issued</a> a €450,000 penalty against Twitter. That represented its first levy against any Silicon Valley company, many of which fall under Dublin's jurisdiction because these firms are legally domiciled in Ireland, mostly for tax reasons.</p>
<p>The multi-million euro draft WhatsApp fine is an initial proposal from Dublin, and has been opened up to other European data protection agencies for their feedback. A final decision on how big the fine should be — and what other remedies WhatsApp should agree to — is not expected until later in the year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner declined to comment. A spokesman for WhatsApp said the company was awaiting the final privacy decision.</p>
<p>In November, Facebook&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1521035">earmarked €77.5 million&nbsp;for a likely privacy fine against its messaging service WhatsApp,&nbsp;</a>which, unlike Instagram, is a separate legal entity in Ireland and therefore has its own set of financial records. The Irish data protection agency is conducting a separate investigation into whether WhatsApp can legally share its users' data with Facebook's other digital services, among other privacy-related concerns.</p>
<p>The draft penalty against WhatsApp, which Ireland <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1577539">submitted</a> to other EU agencies for review just before Christmas, comes as the messenger faces a global backlash over planned updates to its terms and conditions. Those include&nbsp;clarifying to its billions of users how their data is shared more widely with Facebook's other services.</p>
<p>Those changes will not affect WhatsApp European operations, but people across the bloc and elsewhere still have flocked to rivals like Signal because of privacy fears. On January 15, the messenger <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update" target="_blank">said</a> it was delaying the upcoming privacy changes, in part because of the confusion generated by the proposed overhaul.</p>

<p>Johannes Caspar, Hamburg's privacy regulator who filed objections to a previous Irish decision against Twitter, told POLITICO earlier this week that he<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1579886"> had not ruled out </a>doing the same in the WhatsApp case. </p>
<p>"WhatsApp has an enormous amount of users," he said. "It must be clear that the consent mechanism they use must be lawful and that consent is informed and freely given by the users."</p>

  <p>Hello, in this article I would like to share my thoughts about the NixOS Linux distribution.  I've been using it daily for more than six months as my main workstation at work and on some computer at home too.  I also made modest contributions to the git repository. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS official website</a></p>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built around Nix tool.  I'll try to explain quickly what Nix is but if you want more accurate explanations I recommend visiting the project website.  Nix is the package manager of the system, Nix could be used on any Linux distribution on top of the distribution package manager.  NixOS is built from top to bottom from Nix.
</p>
<p>This makes NixOS a system entirely different than what one can expect from a regular Linux/Unix system (at the exception of Guix sharing the same idea with a different implementation).  NixOS system configuration is stateless, most of the system is in read-only and most of paths you know doesn't exist.  The directory /bin/sh only contains "sh" which is a symlink.
</p>
<p>The whole system configuration: fstab, packages, users, services, crontab, firewall... is configured from a global configuration file that defines the state of the system.
</p>
<p>An example of my configuration file to enable graphical interface with Mate as a desktop and a french keyboard layout.
</p>
<pre><code>services.xserver.enable = true;
services.xserver.layout = "fr";
services.xserver.libinput.enable = true;
services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.enable = true;
services.xserver.desktopManager.mate.enable = true;
</code></pre>
<p>I could add the following lines into the configuration to add auto login into my graphical session.
</p>
<pre><code>services.xserver.displayManager.autoLogin.enable = true;
services.xserver.displayManager.autoLogin.user = "solene";
</code></pre>
<h2> Pros</h2>
<p>There are a lot of pros.  The system is really easy to setup, installing a system (for a reinstall or replicate an installation) is very easy, you only need to get the configuration.nix file from the other/previous system.  Everything is very fast to setup, it's often only a few lines to add to the configuration.
</p>
<p>Every time the system is rebuilt from the configuration file, a new grub entry is made so at boot you can choose on which environment you want to boot.  This make upgrades or tries very easy to rollback and safe.
</p>
<p>Documentation! The NixOS documentation is very nice and is part of the code.  There is a special man page "configuration.nix" in the system that contains all variables you can define, what values to expect, what is the default and what it's doing.  You can literally search for "steam", "mediawiki" or "luks" to get information to configure your system.
</p>
<p><a href="https://nixos.org/learn.html">All the documentation</a></p>
<p>Builds are reproducible, I don't consider it a huge advantage but it's nice to have it.  This allow to challenge a package mirror by building packages locally and verifying they provide the exact same package on the mirror.
</p>
<p>It has a lot of packages.  I think the NixOS team is pretty happy to share their statistics because, if I got it right, Nixpkgs is the biggest and up to date repository alive.
</p>
<p><a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">Search for a package</a></p>
<h2> Cons</h2>
<p>When you download a pre compiled Linux program that isn't statically built, it's a huge pain to make it work on NixOS.  The binary will expect some paths to exist at usual places but they won't exist on NixOS.  There are some tricks to get them work but it's not always easy.  If the program you want isn't in the packages, it may not be easy to use it.  Flatpak can help to get some programs if they are not in the packages though.
</p>
<p><a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Packaging/Binaries">Running binaries</a></p>
<p>It takes disk space, some libraries can exist at the same time with small compilation differences.  A program can exist with different version at the same time because of previous builds still available for boot in grub, if you forget to clean them it takes a lot of memory.
</p>
<p>The whole system (especially for graphical environments) may not feel as polished as more mainstream distributions putting a lot of efforts into branding and customization.  NixOS will only install everything and you will have a quite raw environment that you will have to configure.  It's not a real cons but in comparison to other desktop oriented distributions, NixOS may not look as good out of the box.
</p>
<h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p>NixOS is an awesome piece of software.  It works very well and I never had any reliability issue with it.  Some services like xrdp are usually quite complex to setup but it worked out of the box here for me.
</p>
<p>I see it as a huge Lego© box with which you can automate the building of the super system you want, given you have the schematics of its parts.  Once you need a block you don't have in your recipes list, you will have a hard time.
</p>
<p>I really classify it into its own category, in comparison to Linux/BSD distributions and Windows, there is the NixOS / Guix category with those stateless systems for which the configuration is their code.
</p>

        <p>
          There are hidden HDR videos playing at the corners of this page. When a HDR-capable browser encounters one, it switches to HDR mode. For some reason, CSS backdrop-filter + brightness &gt;100% combo seems to behave like HDR—reaching beyond the user-controlled display brightness, up to the maximum HDR brightness—while the everything in between follow along. At least that's the overall idea, but I still don't know exactly why it works; especially why with those two CSS properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the system switches to HDR mode, it seems to affect the whole display. That says, as long as you can trigger HDR mode by any means—simply playing an HDR video on Movist, for example—the CSS trick works on Safari / Chrome / Edge with HDR-capable / SDR devices. This indicates this bug/feature is mostly tied to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/drawable_objects/displaying_hdr_content_in_a_metal_layer">the EDR system.</a>

<![CDATA[An Introduction to Time Representation, Serialization and Management in Software]]>

January 22, 2021 | https://mirkocaserta.com/posts/2013/04/an-introduction-to-time-representation-serialization-and-management-in-software/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mirkocaserta.com/posts/2013/04/an-introduction-to-time-representation-serialization-and-management-in-software/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Most issues in software development usually arise from poor,
inconsistent knowledge of the domain at hand. A topic apparently as
simple as time representation, serialization and management can easily
cause a number of problems both to the neophyte and to the experienced
programmer.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll see that there’s no need to be a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord">Time Lord</a> to grasp the
very simple few concepts needed not to incur into time management hell.</p>
<p><img src="https://mirkocaserta.com/images/posts/time.jpg" alt="Time doesn’t exist. Clocks exist."></p>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<p>A question as simple as <em>“What time is it?"</em> assumes a number of
contextual subleties that are obvious to the human brain, but become
absolute nonsense for a computer.</p>
<p>For instance, if you were asking to me what time is it right now, I
might say: <em>“It’s 3:39”</em> and, if you were a colleague in my office,
that’d be enough information to infer that it’s 3:39pm CEST. That’s
because you would already be in possession of some bits of important
contextual information such as</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s an afternoon because we’ve already had lunch</li>
<li>we’re in Rome, therefore our timezone is Central European Time (CET)
or Central European Summer Time (CEST)</li>
<li>we’ve switched to daylight savings time a few weeks earlier, so the
current timezone must be Central European Summer Time</li>
</ul>
<p><em>3:39</em> only happens to be a convenient representation of time as long as
we’re in possession of the contextual bits.  In order to represent time
in an universal way, you should have an idea what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">timezones</a> are.</p>
<p>Now, suppose I have to schedule a skype chat with a fellow software
developer in the US. I could write him an email and say something along
the lines of <em>“see you on 2/3”</em>. In Italy, that would be the second day
in the month of march, but to an US person, that would be the third day
in the month of february. As you can see, how our chat is never going to
happen.</p>
<p>These are only a few examples of the kind of issues that might arise
when representing date and time information. Luckily enough, there is a
solution to the representation conundrums, namely the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> standard.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example, in ISO 8601, <code>1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00</code>
corresponds to November 5, 1994, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time.
<code>1994-11-05T13:15:30Z</code> corresponds to the same instant (the <code>Z</code> stands
for UTC). Same instant, different representations.</p>
<p>The ISO 8601 standard also has the nice side effect of providing natural
sorting in systems that use lexicographical order (such as filesystems)
because information is organized from most to least significant, i.e.
year, month, day, hour, minute, second, fraction of a second.</p>
<p>Even if you’re only dealing with local times in your software, you
should know that, unless you also display the time zone, you can never
be sure of the time. I cannot remember how many times a developer has
asked me to <em>fix the time</em> on the server, only to discover that his
software was printing time in UTC.</p>
<p>At display time, it is okay to deal with partial representation of time
because the user experience requires so. Just make sure, when debugging,
to print out the whole set of information, including the time zone,
otherwise you can never be sure what you’re looking at is what you
actually think it is.</p>
<p>Although a given moment in time is immutable, there is an arbitrary
number of ways to express it. And we’ve not even talked about the Julian or
Indian calendars or stuff like expressing durations!</p>
<p>Let me summarize a few key points to bring home so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>get to know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">time zones</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> is your friend</li>
<li>always print the time zone while debugging</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://mirkocaserta.com/images/posts/bttf-clock.png" alt="Back to the future clock"></p>
<h2 id="serialization">Serialization</h2>
<p>Speaking of software, serialization is a process where you take an object’s
status and spell it out in such a way that it can be later entirely rebuilt,
exactly like the original, by using the spelt out (serialized) information.
Think of an xml or json file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"person"</span>: {
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Mirko"</span>,
    <span>"surname"</span>: <span>"Caserta"</span>,
    <span>"class"</span>: <span>"nerd"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is the serialized form of a peculiar imaginary person class instance.</p>
<p>In the binary world of computers, time is usually serialized and stored
by using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>
convention. As I’m writing this, my Unix time is <code>1366191727 UTC</code>. That
is: <code>1366191727</code> seconds have passed since January 1st, 1970 at 00:00
UTC. Isn’t that a pretty clever, consistent and compact way of
representing a plethora of information, such as <code>April 17 2013 @ 11:42:07am CEST</code>?</p>
<p>Unix time is only another arbitrary representation of a given moment in time,
although a not very human readable one. But you can take that number, write it
on a piece of paper, stick it onto a carrier pigeon, and your recipient would
be able to decipher your vital message by simply turning to the Internet and
visiting a site such as <a href="http://www.unixtimestamp.com/">unixtimestamp.com</a> or
<a href="https://currentmillis.com/">currentmillis.com</a>.</p>
<p>Just like you can write that number on a piece of paper and later get
back the full instant back to life, you can store it in a file or a
row in your favorite RDBMS. Although you might want to talk to your
RDBMS using a proper driver and handing it a plain date instance; your
driver will then take care of the conversion to the underlying database
serialization format for native time instances.</p>
<p>By storing time using a native format, you get the nice time formatting,
sorting, querying, etc features of your RDBMS for free, so you might want to
think twice before storing plain Unix timestamps in, say, Oracle.</p>
<p>Just make sure you know what timezone your Unix timestamp refers to, or
you might get confused later at deserialization time.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 is also a serialization favorite. In fact, it is used in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats">XML
Schema</a> standard.  Most xml
frameworks are natively able to serialize and deserialize back and forth from
<code>xs:date</code>, <code>xs:time</code> and <code>xs:dateTime</code> to your programming language’s native
format (and viceversa). The same is true for json. Just be careful when dealing
with partial representations: for instance, if you omit the time zone, make
sure you agree beforehand on a default one with your communicating party
(usually UTC or your local time zone if you’re both in the same one).</p>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>First of all, if you think you can write your own time management
software library, or even write a little routine that adds or subtracts
arbitrary values from the time of the day,
please allow me to show you the source code for the
<a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/util/Date.java.html">java.util.Date</a>
and
<a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.java.html">java.util.GregorianCalendar</a>
classes from JDK 7, respectively weighting 1331 and 3179 lines of code.</p>
<p>Okay, these are probably not the best examples of software routines that
deal with time, I agree. That’s why Java libraries like
<a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a> were written.
In fact, Joda Time has become so popular that it gave birth to
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310">JSR-310</a> and is
<a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/JSR-310-s-Date-and-Time-API-added-to-JDK-8-1708647.html">now</a>
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/02/java-time-api-jdk-8">part</a> of JDK 8.</p>
<p>Use of popular, well designed and implemented time frameworks will save your
life. Seriously. Take your time to get familiar with the API of your choosing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you thought 2021 was going to be the year without big drama in the world of open source licensing, you didn’t have to wait long to be disappointed. Two stories have already sprung up in the first few weeks of the year. They’re independent, but related. Both of them remind us that open source is a <em>development</em> model, not a business model.</p>



<h2>Elasticsearch and Kibana</h2>



<p>A few years ago, it seemed like I couldn’t go to any sysadmin/DevOps conference or meetup without hearing about the “<a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack">ELK stack</a>“. ELK stands for the three pieces of software involved: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Because it provided powerful aggregation, search, and visualization of arbitrary log files, it became very popular. This also meant that Amazon Web Services (AWS) saw value in providing an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Elasticsearch service</a>.</p>



<p>As companies moved more workloads to AWS it made sense to pay AWS for Amazon Elasticsearch Service instead of paying Elastic. This represented what you might call a revenue problem for Elastic. So they decided to follow MongoDB’s lead and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">change their license</a> to the Server Side Public License (SSPL).</p>



<p>The SSPL is essentially a “you can’t use it, AWS” license. This makes it decidedly <a href="https://opensource.org/node/1099">not open source</a>. Insultingly, Elastic’s announcement and follow-up messaging include phrases like “doubling down on open”, implying that the SSPL is an open source license. It is not. It a source-available license. And, as open source business expert VM Brasseur writes, it <a href="https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2021/01/14/elasticsearch-and-kibana-are-now-business-risks">creates business risk</a> for companies that use Elasticsearch and Kibana.</p>



<p>Elastic is, of course, free to use whatever license it wants for the software it develops. And it’s free to want to make money. But it’s not reasonable to get mad at companies using the software under the license you chose to use for it. Picking a license is a <a href="https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2019/06/07/the-problem-with-amazon-and-open-source-isnt-amazon/">business decision</a>.</p>



<p>Shortly before I sat down to write this post, I saw that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/?sc_channel=sm&amp;sc_campaign=launch_&amp;sc_publisher=TWITTER&amp;sc_country=Global&amp;sc_geo=GLOBAL&amp;sc_outcome=awareness&amp;trk=launch__TWITTER&amp;linkId=109673114">Amazon has forked Elasticsearch and Kibana</a>. They will take the last-released versions and continue to develop them as open source projects under the Apache License v2. This is entirely permissible and to be expected when a project makes a significant licensing change. So now Elastic is in danger of a sizable portion of the community moving to the fork and away from their projects. If that pans out, it may end up being more harmful than Amazon Elasticsearch Service ever was.</p>



<h2>Nmap Public Source License</h2>



<p>The second story actually started in the fall of 2020, but didn’t seem to get much notice until after the new year. The developers of <a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a>, the widely-used security scanner, began using a new license. Prior to the release of version 7.90, nmap was under a modified version of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2). This license had some additional “gloss”, but was generally accepted by Linux distributions to be a valid free/open source software license.</p>



<p>With version 7.90, nmap is now under the Nmap Public Source License (NPSL). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201127221208/https://nmap.org/npsl/npsl-annotated.html">Version 0.92</a> of this license contained some phrasing that seemed objectionable. The Gentoo licenses team brought their concerns to the developers in a <a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/2199">GitHub issue</a>. Some of their concerns seemed like non-issues to me (and to the lawyers at work I consulted with on this), but one part in particular stood out.</p>



<blockquote><p>Proprietary software companies wishing to use or incorporate Covered Software within their programs must contact Licensor to purchase a separate license</p></blockquote>



<p>It seemed clear that the intent was to restrict proprietary <em>software</em>, not otherwise-compliant projects from companies that produce proprietary software. Nonetheless, as it was written, it constituted a violation of the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd#fields-of-endeavor">Open Source Definition</a>, and we <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/legal@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/GZIDC4DHXZP67LFU7P2OT2AQVDJRHZ2M/">rejected it for use in Fedora</a>.</p>



<p>To their credit, the developers took the feedback well and quickly released an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210113133517/https://nmap.org/npsl/npsl-annotated.html">updated version of the license</a>. They even retroactively licensed affected releases under the updated license. Unfortunately, version 0.93 still contains some problems. In particular, the annotations still express field of endeavor restrictions.</p>



<p>While the license text is the most important part, the annotations still matter. They indicate the intent of the license and guide the interpretation by lawyers and judges. So newer versions of nmap remain unsuitable for some distributions.</p>



<h3>Licenses are not for you to be clever</h3>



<p>Like with Elastic, I’m sympathetic to the nmap developers’ position. If someone is going to use their project to make money, they’d like to get paid, too. That’s an entirely reasonable position to take. But the way they went about it isn’t right. As noted in the GitHub issue, they’re not copyright attorneys. If they were, the license would be much better.</p>



<p>It seems like the developers are fine with people free-riding profit off of nmap so long as the software used to generate the profit is also open source. In that case, why not just use a professionally-drafted and vetted license like the AGPL? The NPSL is already using the GPLv2 and adding more stuff on top of it, and it’s the more stuff on top of it that’s causing problems.</p>



<p>Trying to write your business model into a software license that purports to be open source is a losing proposition.</p>

<p><b>Last change: 2014-12-30</b></p>




While browsing, I found this except from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565922603/heinersshelldora/002-6407720-0447242">Unix Power Tools</a>:

<blockquote>
   ... To fix it, first get the source, and then change it in the obvious three places in xec.c. You will have to learn <strong>Bournegol</strong> [the ALGOL-like dialect of C that Steve Bourne used to
   write the original Bourne shell-JP ]. Another alternative is to replace /bin/sh with one of the free sh look-alikes... (CT in comp.unix.questions on Usenet, 20 February 1990)
</blockquote>

I immediately asked myself: what could Bournegol look like? Well,
it's not that easy to find the <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/src/cmd/sh/">original Bourne
Shell</a> sourcecode, so,
after some googling, I thought I might put an example of Bournegol on
my homepage, so other people have the chance to find about "Bournegol"
without the tedious search.<p>

(many years later I found <a href="http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/sh.tour.ps">this
paper</a>, A Partial Tour Through
the UNIX Shell, which makes for very nice reading).

Ok, without any further ado, here is an excerpt of the file
<tt>xec.c</tt>, referenced above, supposedly from the <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/src/">7th Edition UNIX</a>, that gives you an

					<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We’ve built a machine learning-based Job Transitions Recommender System that can accurately predict the probability of transitioning between occupations. We showcase the system for workers forced to transition between jobs.</li>
<li>The system is based on a novel data-driven method to measure the similarity between occupations based on their underlying skill profiles from real-time job ads.</li>
<li>We’ve also developed a leading indicator of Artificial Intelligence adoption in Australian industries, outlining gaps, opportunities, and trends.</li>
<li>For full technical details, please read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>People are forced to change jobs as new technologies automate labour, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold. Successfully transitioning between jobs, however, requires leveraging current skills and acquiring others, which can falter if the skills gap is too large.</p>
<p>In our latest research, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/marian-andrei-rizoiu-063b19b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marian-Andrei Rizoiu</a>, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/maryanne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary-Anne Williams</a> and I developed a novel method to measure the ‘distance’ between <em>sets of skills</em> using real-time job ads data. We then use these measures to build a recommender system that accurately predicts the probability of transitioning from one occupation to every other possible occupation. Intuitively, two occupations have a high probability of successfully transitioning when their skill sets are highly similar (i.e. the distance is small). For example, an Accountant has a high probability of transitioning to become a Financial Analyst because their skill sets are similar; whereas a Speech Therapist has a low transition probability to becoming a Financial Analyst as their skill sets are very different. This isn’t to say that it’s not possible. Rather, the skills gap is large, so the probability of successfully transitioning is diminished.</p>
<h2><strong>The SKILL SPACE Method</strong></h2>
<h3>Distance between skills</h3>
<p>In order to measure the distance between occupations from their underlying skill sets, we first measure the distance between individual skills in job ads for each calendar year from 2012-2020. To achieve this bottom-up approach, we first use a method from Trade Economics, called ‘Revealed Comparative Advantage’ (RCA), to identify how important an individual skill is to a job ad (i.e. comparative advantage). Then, after some normalisation, we calculate the pairwise similarity between every skill for each year. The image below shows the skill distance embeddings for the top 500 skills by posting frequency in 2018.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all_skills_inset.png" alt="" width="671" height="776"></p>
<p>Here, each marker represents an individual skill that is coloured according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills. As seen in the Software Development cluster (see inset), highly similar skills cluster closely together, such as ‘Python’ and ‘C++’. The skills map also provides useful insights, highlighting that specialised skills (such as ‘Software Development’ and ‘Healthcare’) tend to lay toward the edges of the embedding, whereas more general and transferable skills lay toward the middle, acting as a ‘bridge’ to specialist skills.</p>
<h3>Distance between occupations</h3>
<p>Next, we use the pairwise skill distances to measure the distance between <em>sets of skills</em>. In this example, we define sets of skills by their occupational groupings. But they can just as easily be defined by other groupings, such as companies, industries, or personalised skill sets. We calculate the distance between skill sets as the weighted average similarity between the individual skills in each set, where the weights correspond to the skill importance in their respective sets. The figure below visualises the distance between Australian occupations in 2018.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANZSCO_automation_inset.png" alt="" width="749" height="689"></p>
<p>Each occupation is represented by a marker and coloured on a scale according to their automation susceptibility, as calculated by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162516302244" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frey and Osborne</a> – dark blue represents low-risk probability and dark red shows high-risk probability over the coming two decades. As seen in the magnified inset, similar occupations lie close together on the map. Further, occupations in low-risk of automation tend to be characterised by non-routine, interpersonal, and/or high cognitive labour tasks; whereas occupations in high risk of automation tend to require routine, manual, and/or low cognitive labour tasks. For example, in the inset of the Figure above, a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker’ is deemed to be at high risk of labour automation (82% probability) due to high levels of routine and manual labour tasks required by the occupation. However, the skill set demands of a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker’ are highly similar to an ‘Industrial Designer’, which is considered at low risk of labour automation over the coming two decades (4% probability). Therefore, an ‘Industrial Designer’ represents a transition opportunity for a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker’ that leverages existing skills and protects against potential risks of technological labour automation.</p>
<h2><strong>Constructing the <em>Job Transitions Recommender System</em></strong></h2>
<p>The SKILL SPACE Method described above achieves high levels of accuracy in predicting job transitions. However, these are symmetric measures and we know that <strong>job transitions are <em>asymmetric</em></strong> – it is more difficult to transition between jobs in one direction than the other. Therefore, transitions are determined by more than the symmetric distance between skill sets; other factors, such as educational requirements and experience demands, contribute to these asymmetries.</p>
<p>We account for the asymmetries between job transitions by training a machine learning classifier model that combines the SKILL SPACE distance measures with other labour market variables from job ads data and employment statistics (see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pre-print</a> for full details). Our machine learning model is trained against a dataset of ‘actual’ (i.e. real life) job transitions from an Australian longitudinal household survey. We then apply the trained model to predict the probability for every possible occupational transition in the dataset – described as the transition probability between a ‘source’ and a ‘target’ occupation. This creates the <em>Transitions Map</em>, for which a subset of 20 occupations can be seen in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions.png" alt="" width="1152" height="1152" srcset="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions.png 1152w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-150x150.png 150w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-300x300.png 300w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-768x768.png 768w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-1024x1024.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"></p>
<p>The coloured heatmap shows the transition probabilities (‘source’ occupations are in columns and ‘targets’ are in rows). Dark blue represents higher transition probabilities and lighter blue shows lower probabilities, where the asymmetries between occupation pairs are clearly observed. For example, a ‘Finance Manager’ has a higher probability of transitioning to become an ‘Accounting Clerk’ than the reverse direction. Moreover, transitioning to some occupations is generally easier (for example, ‘Bar Attendants and Baristas’) than others (‘Life Scientists’). The dendrogram (the lines on the left and top of the chart) illustrates the hierarchical clusters of occupations where there is a clear divide between service-oriented professions and manual labour occupations.</p>
<p>Our model achieves high levels of performance, <strong>accurately predicting 76% of occupational transitions</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommending Jobs and Skills</strong></h2>
<p>The <em>Transitions Map</em> provides the basis for making qualified job transition recommendations.&nbsp;We call this the <em>Job Transitions Recommender System</em>. In the figure below, we make job recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners’ as an example – an occupation that has experienced significant declines in labour demand and employment levels during COVID-19 in Australia.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated.png" alt="" width="1401" height="628" srcset="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated.png 1401w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated-300x134.png 300w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated-768x344.png 768w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated-1024x459.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1401px) 100vw, 1401px"></p>

<p>First, we use the <em>Transitions Map</em> to recommend the occupations with the highest transition probabilities; these are the named occupations on the right side of the flow diagram, ordered in descending order of transition probability. Segment widths show the labour demand for each of the recommended occupations during the beginning of the COVID-19 period (measured by posting frequency). The segment colours represent the percentage change of posting frequency during March and April 2019 compared to the same months in 2020; dark red indicates a big decrease in job ad posts and dark blue indicates a big increase. The first six transition recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners’ all experienced negative demand, which is unsurprising given that ‘non-essential’ services were restricted in Australia during this period. However, the seventh recommendation, ‘Aged and Disabled Carers’, had significantly grown in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period and there was a high number of jobs advertised. Given that it is generally favourable to transition to high demand jobs, we selected ‘Aged and Disabled Carers’ as the target occupation for this example.</p>
<h3>Skill recommendations for target occupations</h3>
<p>We then take the <em>Job Transitions Recommender System</em> a step further by incorporating skill recommendations. Transitioning to a new occupation generally requires developing new skills under time and resource constraints. Therefore, workers must prioritise which skills to develop. We argue that a worker should invest in developing a skill when (1) the <strong>skill is important to the target occupation</strong> <em>and</em> (2) the <strong>distance to acquire the skill is large</strong> (that is, it is relatively difficult to acquire). In the case of the ‘Domestic Cleaner’ in the figure above, the top recommended skills to assist in the transition to the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ occupation are specialised patient care skills, such as ‘Patient Hygiene Assistance’.&nbsp;Conversely, the reasons <em>not</em> to develop a skill are when (1) the <strong>skill is not important</strong> <em>or</em> (2) the <strong>distance is small to the target occupation</strong>. The figure shows that while some ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ jobs require ‘Business Analysis’ and ‘Finance’ skills, these skills are of low importance for the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ occupation, so they should not be prioritised. Similarly, skills such as ‘Ironing’ and ‘Laundry’ are required by ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ jobs but the distance is small, so it is likely that either a ‘Domestic Cleaner’ already possesses these skills or they can easily acquire them.</p>

            <p>Matrix Multiply forms the foundation of Machine Learning computations. We show Apple’s M1 custom AMX2 Matrix Multiply unit can outperform ARMv8.6’s standard NEON instructions by about <strong>2X</strong>.</p>
<p>Nod’s AI Compiler team focusses on the state of art code generation, async partitioning, optimizations and scheduling to overlap communication and compute on various A.I hardware from large datacenter clusters to edge A.I silicon. The basic computation building block for all of that is the venerable Matmul. In this post we focus on the the Matmul performance on the just released Apple M1 Chip since that translates directly to how much you can squeeze out of any A.I hardware.</p>
<p>Typically silicon teams work closely with the optimization teams to create highly optimized SGEMM ( <b>S</b>ingle precision&nbsp;<b>GE</b>neral&nbsp;<b>M</b>atrix&nbsp;<b>M</b>ultiply) and DGEMM (<strong>D</strong>ouble precision <strong>GE</strong>neral <strong>M</strong>atrix <strong>M</strong>ulitply) kernels for each silicon platform. Intel’s <strong>MKL</strong> provides these kernels for the Intel chipsets and Apple’s <strong>Accelerate Framework&nbsp;</strong>provides highly optimized kernels for Apple machines (both Intel and Apple Silicon).</p>
<p>Eigen provides a reasonably easy to use high-level template library of these linear algebra algorithms while also exposing building blocks like <strong>GEBP</strong> (GeneralBlockPanelKernel) “traits” for each SoC.&nbsp; These GEBP traits effectively allow you to use Compiler Intrinsics and custom instructions to target a particular SoC while still wrapping it up in higher level C++ for ease of use. BLIS (a BLAS like library) also follows a similar paradigm where the “inner most” microkernel is highly hand optimized assembly for a particular architecture and&nbsp; forms the foundation of the higher level computations that could be written in more portable code. There is a good read on the concepts used by BLIS <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/pubs/blis2_toms_rev2.pdf">here</a>. However BLIS’s microkernel on ARM/NEON is woefully inadequate (See <a href="https://github.com/flame/blis/issues/421">this bug report</a> when building with clang). There have been other attempts to write the GEBP kernel in portable code (see <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling/papers/cgo17.pdf">this</a>), but I think Eigen is probably the most successful with the backing of the Tensorflow and Android efforts.</p>
<p>Apple’s M1 SoC&nbsp; has received rave reviews on its performance. It includes extension to the ARM Architectural Specification to include a Matrix Co-Processor – commonly referred to as <strong>AMX (Apple Matrix Co-processor)</strong>. The version in the M1 SoC is supposedly a “Version 2” so let’s refer to it as AMX2. Supposedly the AMX2 is tightly coupled with the ARM core (has custom instructions to access it) than the <strong>ANE (Apple Neural Engine)</strong> which is a separate Neural Processing Unit on the SoC – which would behave more like an integrated GPU with higher latencies and higher throughput when compared to the inline AMX2.</p>
<p>Apple has not released the instructions to access the AMX2.&nbsp; This way there is no need to maintain backwards compatibility with compiled software. The only way you should (though not the only way you <em>can</em>) currently access AMX2 on&nbsp; M1 SoC is via the Accelerate Framework.&nbsp; ARM has just started adding support for Architecture ARMv8.7-a in <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/search/query/OxQ0whlSn_CS/#R">LLVM</a> and specifically the support for Accelerators such as AMX <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D91775">here</a> . It includes the ability to add Accelerators such as the AMX but it is unclear if AMX will adhere to that specification. You can find out more about ARMv8.7-a <a href="https://youtu.be/CSUohi1XY78"><strong>here</strong></a></p>
<p>In this post we will evaluate a <strong>simple SGEMM with a size of 1000</strong> using AMX2 and Eigen’s Neon optimized version on the Apple M1.&nbsp; We have done some tests with other ARMv8 SoCs but it is not apples to apples since they were older generation parts or had different toolchain options etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;All tests were done with top of master Clang (12.0.0+) built with OpenMP support (for Eigen’s parallelism) and top of master Eigen. We run 10 iterations of the Matrix multiply as warmup (to initialize any lazy loading libraries or fill the instruction and data caches) and then run the test 20 times and average the run times.&nbsp; We have to use Eigen noalias() to make sure there are no unnecessary copies.</p>
<p>We compile the code with -O3 and validate with <em>“otool -L”</em> that we link against Accelerate when using it and just standard libs otherwise. Also “otool -tv a.out | grep fmla” should show you the NEON FMLA instructions being used as shown below:</p>
<pre><span>nodai@macbook-pro-2 pytorch % otool -tv a.out| grep fmla</span>

<p><strong>CPU utilization:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the test matrix size of 1000 there is negligible cpu utilization so we tried increasing the matrix size large enough to see some impact. With AMX2 the CPU utilization delta is negligible but there is likely memory pressure to DMA into the AMX2, however with NEON we can saturate the CPU cores.</p>

<p>But is this the best NEON optimization possible ? Based on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i3GXUku9e76B7YwPnYiDx-d36ZuL85WRKEnNiIgA8rQ/edit#gid=1050198706">work</a> as part of GEMMLOWP project there should be more room. So we ran the “standalone NEON tests” on the M1. This should give us a good idea on the delta between Eigen’s GEBP and a fully hand optimized NEON kernel by ARM themselves (though for a Cortex-A57 class core).&nbsp; The results are below:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Based on the above we estimate there is another 20% or so we can squeeze out of the NEON implementation.&nbsp; An important point to consider is the overhead of using intrinsics vs full inline assembly – you still have to make a choice between portability and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Single Threaded FP32 Matmul AMX2</strong></p>
<p>After the post was initially written we found there is an environment variable <span>VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREAD</span> that can control single threaded operation of Accelerate. Stay tuned for more controlled studies.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This is a first pass performance test of using AMX2 vs NEON on the <strong>Apple M1 </strong>that<b> shows AMX2 roughly twice as fast as the NEON implementation</b>. There are probably a lot of corner cases to consider and tweaks to be done to the the NEON code especially with the varying size of L2 caches between the different cores.&nbsp; Based on the GEMMLowP work we estimate there is atleast another 20% or so left on the table with NEON. Let us know if we missed anything. Right now the system (Core clocks, core types, scheduler priorities etc) is not in a controlled environment to test it throughly but hopefully this gives us a first order approximation of what performance to expect at the fundamental building block – a Matmul, on the Apple M1.</p>
<p><strong>Future Work:</strong></p>
<p>In our next blog post we will build on a MatMul and share some numbers of the Nod Compiler’s codegen capabilities to automatically generate these GEMM kernels and other common kernels used in Machine Learning and compare the performance to native frameworks like MKL/MKL-DNN, Accelerate / MLCompute and Cudnn/cuBLAS on the GPU.</p>

<h4>Update 1 (12/30): Add first pass ruy numbers and push source code</h4>
<p>Thanks the Benoit Jacob from the Google&nbsp; who has worked on Eigen, Gemmlowp, TFlite, IREE etc we have first pass ruy numbers below on the M1. Stay tuned for more detailed comparisons and numbers.</p>

		<p>When I posted the <a href="https://cakecrumbs.me/2013/05/24/commission-earth-structural-layer-cake/">Earth cake</a>, I did not expect it to get anywhere near the amount of attention it received. Getting featured on the Facebook pages Think Geek and I Fucking Love Science was a total highlight of my blogging life. I’m big fans of both pages so it was kind of surreal. A lot of my Zoology graduate mates are also fans of IFLS and you’d often hear conversations in the Masters office beginning with, “Did you see that post by IFLS today?” So I woke up to several of them messaging me about it and we all got super excited over it.</p>
<p>With the exposure those pages brought came a whole lot of people who wanted to know how to make it. I still get a couple of emails a week asking for a recipe. The cake was a total experiment on my part, and not one that went flawlessly. There were many imperfections within the cake and I never share recipes unless I know it’s absolutely tried and true. I’d hate to be responsible for a baking fail simply for giving a botched up recipe. But I also hate letting people down. So I decided to re-visit the concept so I could make a tutorial. That will come later in the week as I’m still editing it. But first, here’s the result of round 2.</p>

<p>One question I got asked a lot was if it was possible to make it a sphere. Absolutely it is. If you can make the hemisphere a sphere is easy. I didn’t want to make another Earth cake as I hate repeating bakes, so I opted to decorate it as something new. I threw around a few ideas ranging from something floral to a giant pokéball, but in the end I just wanted to make another planet.</p>

<p>Choosing a favourite planet was tough. As a kid I was fiercely passionate about two things: animals and the solar system. I ended up following the path of the former and never kept up to date with the latter, but the inner passion for astronomy has never died. Space is just <em>so freaking cool</em>. Our solar system alone is filled with so many fascinating planets, dwarf planets and all their satellites — choosing just one felt treacherous.</p>

<p>In the end I settled on Jupiter predominantly for one reason: its Great Red Spot. The giant anticyclonic storm has always been one of my favourite things and continues to be a subject of great fascination for me. At thrice the size of the Earth it’s bewildering to comprehend the actual magnitude of it. If I absolutely have to choose a favourite planet, it’s got to Jupiter for that storm alone. It’s also so iconic. It’s a characteristic feature almost everyone is familiar with, making it easier to create something that would be instantly recognisable.</p>
<p>The red spot is one of a number of storms you can see all over Jupiter. Some of them last hours, others last for centuries. The red spot had been around since the early 1800s, and it’s possible that it may remain as a permanent feature of the planet. It would be fascinating to see Jupiter if the storm did in fact die out, or if another large one were to appear. The smaller white storms are made up of cool clouds in the upper atmosphere, whereas the brown dots are composed of warmer clouds in the lower atmosphere.</p>

<p>I detailed the atmosphere of Jupiter by covering the cake with ivory marshmallow fondant, then dry brushing a combination of ivory, brown and maroon edible ink. The top ended up being a bit more saturated as I was largely experimenting with colours at that point and was throwing in a bit of yellow. I ended up sticking mostly with ivory and adding extra detail with the brown. Once all the base colours were down I started removing colour to create the storms or other distinguishing features and topping it off with highlights. The whole process took about 8 hours with teeny tiny brushes.</p>

<p>It was kind of difficult to get good reference shots of the non-red-spot sides of Jupiter, particularly to get consistent ones. They were all taken over many different years and influenced by many different weather events so there was lots of variation. But I got enough to get a rough guestimate of the more static features of Jupiter’s atmosphere. The rest I’ll just claim as artistic license.</p>
<p>Finally came time to cut the cake and see how there spheres lined up inside. It turned out better matched than I’d anticipated.</p>

<p>When my sister asked me what I was making and I said Jupiter, she said to me, “I didn’t even know Jupiter had layers.” It’s amazing how much we can forget after learning it in primary school. So here’s a rehashing for those of you who’ve also forgotten. Our knowledge is mostly theoretical of course, but the gas giants are thought to have a core comprised mostly of rock and ice. This is surrounded by a layer liquid metallic hydrogen, and the outer layer is composed of molecular hydrogen. *cake is totally not to scale</p>

<p>In cake speak, this translates to a core made of mudcake, surrounded by almond butter cake, surrounded by a tinted vanilla Madeira sponge. There’s a crumb coat of vanilla buttercream underneath the fondant.</p>
<p>This run went so much better than the first, informed by the mistakes and lessons learned in the mean time. So I feel much safer sharing the process with you guys now. Stay tuned for that later this week if all goes to plan.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>Discomfort, a slight physical or emotional pain, developed as an evolutionary necessity; historically, considering the unpleasantness of discomfort during decision making was for the best of the species. Berries make your stomach uneasy? Stop eating them. Prickly bush scratches your skin? Don’t let it happen again.</p>
<p>On average your body does a good job correlating discomfort with actions that are bad for your well being, but it’s important to note that your body isn’t right 100% of the time!</p>
<p>The world has changed a lot since we developed the capacity to feel discomfort. I claim that people would be better off if they were to diminish or even eliminate the role that discomfort plays in the decision making process, opting instead for considering “long term” consequences. At least personally, this mentality shift has had a huge positive impact on my day to day life.</p>

<p>There are many things that people know they should be doing try to do but can’t do with success:</p>
<ul>
<li>eating healthy</li>
<li>getting 8 hours of sleep a night</li>
<li>exercising regularly</li>
<li>taking cold showers</li>
</ul>
<p>A common reason people don’t commit to these resolutions is that they rationalize them away on the basis of the required discomfort. People don’t want to miss out on the taste of junk food, or deal with the pain of a work out. After removing discomfort, the only reason left not to do build these healthy habits would be the cost of time, but even the busiest people can carve out a little bit of time for these activities that have much higher returns than the time investment (yes even you!).</p>

<p>Since the new year I have started every morning with a 20 minute workout. My workout consists of handstand pushups, pullups, hanging leg raises, and stretching. By framing the workout as having a cost of 20 minutes and forgetting about the discomfort I will experience during the workout, I am having an easier time maintaining the habit (knock on wood). It takes just 20 minutes and leaves me feeling energized for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>After my workout I hop into a cold shower. Similarly, I dispell thoughts relating to the discomfort of the cold water, and instead phrase the cold shower as a healthy experience that will take just 5 minutes. I wake right up and feel warm as soon as I get out of the cold.</p>

<p>The previous examples were activites of relatively minor discomfort that have compounding positive effects when incorporating them into daily life. Another benefit of making them ritual is to prepare you for dire needs which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a necessary confrontation</li>
<li>asking someone out</li>
<li>asking for a raise</li>
<li>building moral courage</li>
<li>generally getting out of one’s comfort zone</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the types of scenarios where people often regret not stepping out of their comfort zones; by building a tolerance for discomfort you will more easily take them on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day. Do every day or two something for no other reason than that you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire needs draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test - The Way To Willpower</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope that this mentality shift is as helpful to you as it was to me. Please leave any comments or reflections below :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
   
   <p>When I encounter a new class of vulnerability or attack vector, I typically add a check for it in <a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/sobelow">Sobelow</a>. Occasionally, however, I see an opportunity for these issues to be mitigated at the library level. In these cases, I try to reach out to JosÃ© or Chris to talk through potential solutions.</p>
   <p>For example, I recently ran into the following issue:</p>
   <pre><code>&lt;%= form_for @conn, "https://third-party-site", fn f -&gt; %&gt;
  &lt;%= email_input f, :email %&gt;
  &lt;%= submit "Get notified!" %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</code></pre>
   <p>A developer building SiteA added a form for a third-party service (SiteB), using Phoenixâ€™s built-in <code>form_for</code> function. Because Phoenix forms include a valid CSRF token by default, these tokens were being leaked to the third-party<sup><a href="#g939451-footnote-1-definition" name="g939451-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup>. As a consequence, SiteB could cause a user to perform unwanted actions on SiteA, such as updating their password or deleting their account.</p>
   <p>This is the problem we were aiming to fix. But before getting to our solution, I want to flesh out the problem a little bit. Letâ€™s start with an overview of Cross-Site Request Forgery (or CSRF), one of the webâ€™s most common vulnerabilities.</p>
   <h2 id="what-is-csrf">What is CSRF?</h2>
   <p>The basic idea is this: Any website can create a form pointing to any other website. They can also automatically fill out and submit these forms. Because cookies are sent with every request, a CSRF attack allows untrusted applications to cause a userâ€™s browser to submit requests and perform authenticated actions on the userâ€™s behalf. Thankfully, web libraries such as Phoenix and Plug have adopted techniques to mitigate such attacks.</p>
   <p>The most common solution to this problem, and the one taken by Phoenix, is to store a unique, random token in the userâ€™s session. This token is then fetched by the client and sent along with every request. When an application processes the request, the submitted token should match the token stored in the userâ€™s session. This way, a malicious website can only cause a user to make valid requests if they have access to a valid CSRF token.</p>
   <p>Now, this is where our initial issue comes into play. When using form generation for third-party or dynamic endpoints, valid CSRF tokens will be leaked by default, leaving users vulnerable to attack. This is something that an experienced developer will probably catch, but itâ€™s a common enough occurrence that it would be nice if the issue could be addressed.</p>
   <p>So, the core issue is simple: In some cases, valid CSRF tokens are leaked by default. And the desired outcome is clear: Donâ€™t leak valid tokens by default. But, in achieving that solution, there are a few considerations:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Tokens leaked in this manner shouldnâ€™t be useful to an attacker.</li>
    <li>A solution shouldnâ€™t increase burden on the developer, and it shouldnâ€™t sacrifice performance.</li>
    <li>Tokens should work across domains when desired.</li></ol>
   <h2 id="what-is-the-solution">What is the solution?</h2>
   <p>Ultimately, the solution is actually pretty simple. If the token is being generated for a path, as is typical, then everything stays the same. That is, fetching the CSRF token looks something like this:</p>
   <pre><code>get_csrf_token()</code></pre>
   <p>However, if a token is fetched for a fully qualified host, it looks more like this:</p>
   <pre><code>csrf_token = get_csrf_token()
key = KeyGenerator.generate(secret, csrf_token)
host_token = MessageVerifier.sign(host, key)</code></pre>
   <p>The userâ€™s CSRF token is fetched like normal. However, instead of returning the token directly, the token is used as a â€œsaltâ€� in a key derivation function. This newly derived secret key is then used to sign a message which includes the target host.</p>
   <p>On the receiving end of things, the CSRF tokenâ€™s signature is validated. If the signature verification succeeds, then the host is validated to ensure it matches a set of allowed hosts (or the host header). If either of these checks fails, the request is rejected as fraudulent.</p>
   <p>Letâ€™s look back at the initial problem, this time using our new host tokens.</p>
   <p>A developer building SiteA adds a form for a third-party service (SiteB), using Phoenixâ€™s built-in <code>form_for</code> function. Because Phoenix forms include a CSRF token by default, these tokens will be leaked to the third-party. Fortunately, these are now the signed host tokens. If the malicious site attempts to initiate a CSRF attack, the host signed in the token (SiteB) wonâ€™t match the host being requested (SiteA). As a consequence, SiteBâ€™s attack fails.</p>
   <p>This technique has a few benefits. First, and most importantly, nothing changes in the vast majority of cases. Most forms will continue to include plain, standard CSRF tokens. But now, if CSRF tokens are leaked in the described manner, we are safe from attack. Further, unlike other potential solutions, this solution will still work seamlessly across subdomains and domains the developer controls.</p>
   <p>With this solution, we prevent usable tokens from leaking by default, require no changes from the end-developer, and still allow the same range of functionality.</p>
   <p>These changes are live on Plug 1.5.0 and phoenix_html 2.10.0!</p>
