<h2>Metacognition definition</h2>
<p>Metacognition refers to “thinking about thinking” and was initiated as a notion by John Flavell, who is generally known as a founding <a href="https://trendrep.net/keri-hilson-pregancy/">father</a> of the field. Flavell explained that metacognition is the understanding you have of your own cognitive processes (your thinking), Flavell (1979). It is your capability to monitor your thinking processes through several strategies, like organizing, monitoring, and adapting. In addition, it is your capability to reflect upon the tasks or processes you undertake and to select and use the adequate strategies in your intercultural interactions.</p>
<p>Metacognition is considered a crucial element of successful learning. It includes self-regulation and self-reflection of strengths, weaknesses, and the types of strategies you develop. It is an essential instauration in culturally intelligent leadership because it emphasizes how you think along an issue or situation and the strategies you develop to treat this situation or problem.</p>
<p>Some people become habitual to getting trainers and consultants offer them the knowledge about cultures to the point where they are reliant on the coach, mentor, trainer, or consultant. However, they must learn to be experts in cultural scenarios themselves over metacognitive strategies like adapting, monitoring, self-regulation, and self-reflection. Culturally intelligent leaders may utilize metacognition to aid and teach themselves to reflect through their thinking.</p>
<p>Metacognition includes three components: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive and emotions, and metacognitive strategies. Each of these is addressed in the next paragraphs.</p>
<h2>Why Teach Metacognitive Skills?</h2>
<p>Research demonstrates that metacognitive skills may be tutored to students to ameliorate their learning (Nietfeld &amp; Shraw, 2002; Thiede, Anderson, &amp; Therriault, 2003).</p>
<p>Constructing understanding necessitates both cognitive and metacognitive components. Trainees “construct knowledge” utilizing cognitive strategies, and they orientate, modulate, and assess their learning utilizing metacognitive strategies. It is through this “thinking about thinking,” this use of metacognitive strategies, that real learning happens. As students become more skilled at utilizing metacognitive strategies, they attain confidence and become more autonomous as learners.</p>
<p>Individuals with well-developed metacognitive competencies may analyze a problem or approach a learning task, choose adequate strategies, and decide about a course of measures to solve the problem or efficiently execute the task. They frequently reflect about their own thinking processes, taking time to reflect about and learn from mistakes&nbsp; (North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, 1995). Some pedagogical programs motivate students to participate in “metacognitive conversations” with themselves so that they can “talk” with themselves about their learning, the challenges they meet, and the ways in which they may self-compensate and continue learning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, individuals who prove a wide diversity of metacognitive competencies execute better on exams and accomplish work more efficiently—they use the right tool for the job, and they modify learning strategies as required, defining blocks to learning and changing tools or strategies to assure objectives accomplishment. Because Metacognition plays a crucial function in productive learning, it is insistent that mentors assist learners create metacognitively.</p>
<h2>Metacognitive Knowledge</h2>
<p>Metacognitive knowledge includes:</p>
<p> 1) learning processes and your confidence about how you learn and how you reflect others learn.</p>
<p> 2) the task of learning and how you process information.</p>
<p> 3) the strategies you develop and when you will utilize them.</p>
<p> Let us say you should to learn a new language in six months. Here is how you would reflect about it, using metacognitive knowledge:</p>
<ul><li>Learning Process: I am good at learning new languages and I think I may do this in the time period I have been given.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Task of Learning: To accomplish this task, I will need to reflect about the following:</li></ul>
<ol><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; How soon may I get information to begin learning the language?</li></ol>
<ol reversed="" start="2"><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; How much time would it take to learn the new language?</li></ol>
<ol reversed="" start="3"><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; What information is accessible to me to learn this new language?</li></ol>
<ol reversed="" start="4"><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this language comparable to any language I have learned before?</li></ol>
<ol reversed="" start="5"><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Will I be capable to learn the language in time?</li></ol>
<ol reversed="" start="6"><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; How difficult will it be for me to learn this language?</li></ol>
<ol reversed="" start="7"><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; What I have to do to learn the language?</li></ol>
<ul><li>The Strategies: I think learning this new language will take&nbsp; 12 months, but I only have 6 months to do it. I better check other ways to meet this goal. I think I will check if there is an accelerated language class that I may take. Maybe I must consider hiring a private tutor, or maybe I will just concentrate on learning the basics of the language.</li></ul>
<h2>Metacognition and Emotions&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Arnold Bennett, a British writer, explained that one may not have knowledge without having <a href="https://trendrep.net/what-is-teratogen-pregnancy/">emotions</a>, Bennett (1933). In metacognition, there are feelings and emotions present that are related to the objectives and tasks of learning. These elements of metacognition speaks to metacognitive experience, which is your internal response to learning. Your feelings and emotions serve as a feedback system to help you understand your progress and estimates, and your comprehension and connection of new information to the old, among other things.</p>
<p>When you learn a new language, for example, you can recall memories, information, and earlier experiences in your life to help you resolve the task of learning a new language. In doing this, your internal responses (metacognitive experience) might be frustration, disappointment, happiness, or satisfaction. Each of these internal responses may impact the task of learning a new language and determine your willingness to continue. Critical to metacognition is the capability to purposely nurture a positive mindset and positive feelings toward your learning.</p>
<h2>Metacognitive Strategies</h2>
<p>Metacognitive strategies are what you design to supervise your progress correlated with your learning and the tasks at hand. It is a process for controlling your thinking activities and to assure you are meeting your objectives. Metacognitive strategies for learning a new language may comprise the following:</p>
<ul><li>Monitoring whether you understand the language lessons;</li></ul>
<ul><li>Realizing when you fail to comprehend information addressed to you in the new language;</li></ul>
<ul><li>Identifying strategies that help you to develop your comprehension;</li></ul>
<ul><li>Adjusting your speed for learning the information (for example, studying for 2 hours, instead of 1 hour, every day);</li></ul>
<ul><li>Maintaining the attitude necessary to assure you accomplish the lessons in a timely manner;</li></ul>
<ul><li>Creating a check-in system at the end of each week to make sure you understand what you have learned.</li></ul>
<p>As one business manager of a reputed company told me:</p>
<p>Understanding cultural strategic reflecting is like this: When I work with people from various cultures, this is a framework and approach to help me comprehend how I think when I work with them. It helps me to recognize the cultural experiences I have had, and to identify preconceived notions I could have about their culture, whether it’s race/ethnicity, social culture, age group—you name it. Cultural strategic reflecting pushes me to develop experiences and new learning that helps me to complete my objectives as a global manager.G. Menefee (personal communication, May 12, 2010).</p>
<p>Individuals like this leader are good at applying strategies that focus their attention on the target at hand. They look for, and derive meaning from, cultural interacts and situations, and they adjust themselves to the situation when things do not pan out as they expected. Culturally intelligent leaders also supervise and organize their own learning processes. They have established a high motivation for learning the metacognitive mechanism, either because they know it is a benefit or because others tell them it is beneficial to them.</p>
<p>Knowledge of actual information and basic competences offers a foundation for developing metacognition. Metacognition empowers leaders to master information and solve problems more easily. When a leader has learned the fundamental competences required for intercultural interacts, they may strongly engage in the interaction because they do not have to consider the other dynamics and demands of the situation. Culturally intelligent leaders are capable to apply metacognition, and they are not afraid to use it in their daily life.</p>
<p>For those who lack basic intercultural skills, it is more hard for them to engage in the interaction. They are more occupied with finding the “right information,” the “right skills,” and the “right facts” required to solve the problem. In such situations, these kinds of leaders spend little time improving their metacognitive competencies, and the result is probably an inefficient solution to a problem. Designing a laundry list or checklist of do’s and don’ts will not help leaders improving their cultural intelligences.</p>

This is in some ways a rational response to elite failures, in some ways an inevitable consequence of the public becoming better educated, in some ways an unavoidable side effect of better information technology, and in some ways a deplorable thing that we should try to reverse. </p><p>But something I’ve become increasingly convinced of is that policymakers need to acknowledge that it’s a real feature of the landscape and adjust their decision-making accordingly. </p><p>In particular, they need to adjust it in an appropriate way. A very large share of the people involved in politics and government are lawyers, and their lawyerly instinct about the problem seems to be that you need to layer on more layers of process. If people are worried about the discretionary use of power, you need to make sure the decision-makers go through an elaborate compliance checklist. But as Princess Leia tried to explain to Grand Moff Tarkin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wntX-a3jSY">“the more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.”</a> </p><p>When you try to address low trust through compliance, you end up where Andrew Cuomo is —&nbsp;he’s creating an elaborate checklist for vaccine prioritization which is hard to follow, so he’s ramping up penalties for people who don’t comply, which is slowing vaccine administration and further eroding trust. </p><p>But the same basic problem pops up everywhere from fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing to <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2020/12/31/streets-before-trust/">bike lanes</a>. </p><p>The correct way to respond to a low-trust environment is not to double down on proceduralism, but to commit yourself to the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2020/12/31/streets-before-trust/">“it does exactly what it says on the tin”</a> principle and implement policies that have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li><p>It’s easy for everyone, whether they agree with you or disagree with you, to understand what it is you say you are doing. </p></li><li><p>It’s easy for everyone to see whether or not you are, in fact, doing what you said you would do. </p></li><li><p>It’s easy for you and your team to meet the goal of doing the thing that you said you would do. </p></li></ul><p>That’s not a guarantee of political or policy success. Maybe you will pick terrible ideas and be a huge failure anyway. But this triad for success under conditions of distrust at least creates the <em>possibility</em> of success, where people will look back and decide that what you did worked. Committing yourself to that triad may involve some waste and inefficiency relative to a more theoretically optimal scheme with more means-testing. </p><p>And it will almost certainly involve a bit more high-handedness and less community consultation. But it allows you to establish yourself as conditionally trustworthy in the sense that your policies do exactly what it says on the tin. And if you pick policies that work, you’re then in a position to rebuild trust as people see that confidence in you is rewarded.</p><h4>The vaccine prioritization fiasco</h4><p>In my December 18 post, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/vaccinate-elderly">“Give The Vaccine To The Elderly,”</a> I argued in favor of a pretty strict age-based prioritization system primarily because that would be a transparent and easy to implement mechanism. </p><p>As I researched it, I came across the fact — which has been flagged by others as well — that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was recommending a more complicated scheme in part on racial justice grounds. Because everyone loves culture war arguments, this became a huge controversy and several conservative states like Texas made big shows of rejecting the Social Justice Warrior concepts. That’s fine, but unfortunately, they did not accept the wisdom of implementing a transparent and easy to implement mechanism. </p><p>Instead, operating under the principle that everyone wants to be vaccinated in Group 1 they have divided Group 1 into three subgroups — 1A, 1B, and 1C. But then Group 1A is <a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/immunize/vaccine/EVAP-Phase1A.pdf">subdivided into two separate tiers</a>, and we’re still awaiting word on how Group 1C will be subdivided, to say nothing of Group 2 or Group 3. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:1286,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:280147,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>So while New York and California, with their presumably more social justice-inflected vaccine distributions, have managed to disburse only 31 percent and 28 percent of their vaccine doses (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html">I’m going by New York Times data</a>), Texas and Florida, who made a big deal of rejecting ACIP, are not doing much better at 36 percent and 31 percent. The very worst performances are in Kansas, Georgia, Arizona, Mississippi, and Idaho, so there’s clearly a lot more afoot here than pure partisan politics. </p><p>And in many ways we still haven’t gotten to the real pain point of prioritization systems, which is going to be where people with “at least one chronic medical condition” get to cut the line. In the abstract, of course if you’re 52 and have a bad heart then you need the vaccine more than someone who’s 64 and in perfect health. But in practice, this means you are allocating vaccines not based on <em>actual</em> population health, but based on who is in possession of a note from their doctor. </p><p>The system, as implemented, will not do what it says on the tin. As people notice that, they will become more aggressive about wanting to cheat the system. And as backlash builds, pressure will build for tighter enforcement, which will further slow down administration. </p><p>A pure age-based system — “show up at CVS or Walgreens and they’ll give you the shot if you’re over 75” with the age cutoff steadily dropping over time —&nbsp;is not perfect. But it’s really easy to check people’s IDs, the rich and powerful have no good way to game that system, and the smooth operation of the system itself will build trust.</p><h4>Checks for everyone </h4><p>I cover American public policy professionally, and I would have trouble explaining to you exactly how the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program">Paycheck Protection Program</a> works. </p><p>Formally speaking, it’s a Small Business Administration loan guarantee program rather than a direct payroll subsidy like many European countries did. But when you peak under the hood, one of the key advantages of the PPP loan is that it will be forgiven if you meet certain criteria, including <a href="https://onpay.com/covid-19/ppp-loan-forgiveness">not laying off your employees</a> and using the money for certain <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program#section-header-5">specific eligible expenses</a>. </p><p>Because the program is complicated, it’s generated an endless series of compliance complaints:</p><ul><li><p>Because it’s supposed to be a small business program, a whole genre of journalism emerged complaining that too much PPP money was going to bigger companies —&nbsp;but of course, bigger companies employ more people.</p></li><li><p>Because it’s supposed to be a loan program but in practice a lot of the loans are forgiven, you get complaints about monetary losses to the government.</p></li><li><p>Because you’re <em>allowed</em> to accept a loan without applying for full forgiveness, some PPP recipients got money and did layoffs, generating complaints that it didn’t really protect payrolls.</p></li></ul><p>And on top of all that, there were significant administrative burdens associated with the program which generated a lot of complaints from business owners, the very people who are supposed to be enthusiastic about PPP.</p><p>Instead, a myth developed that the government — which put hundreds of billions of dollars in small business assistance on the table — was barely doing anything.</p><p>Fundamentally, I would say that the problem with the program is that it didn’t do what it says on the tin, in part because it’s not at all clear what it said on the tin. It seems to have started with the thought that the Fed keeping interest rates low was helping big businesses because they could sell bonds to ride out the pandemic, so there should be a comparable lending program for smaller companies. But if the government is going to help out smaller companies, it should make sure that it’s actually saving jobs. And if we’re going to give companies loans to maintain payroll, but they’re often not going to be able to pay the loan back, there should be loan forgiveness. In the end, Congress backed itself into something that was a lot closer to a European-style payroll subsidy program than to a loan program, but with most of the trappings of a loan program.</p><p>By contrast, sending $1,200 to almost everyone was seen as a huge success, and <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/12/28/78-of-likely-voters-support-2000-relief-checks">sending more checks is wildly popular</a>. </p><p>The checks did what they said on the tin. They didn’t attempt to distinguish between the deserving and the undeserving. They didn’t specify whether you had to use the check to make rent or could just blow it on a new iPhone. And they <em>also</em> didn’t attempt to address any particular racial social justice concerns. Critically, they didn’t claim to do any of these things. The only claim was that almost everyone would get some money, and they did. </p><h4>QE for the people </h4><p>A policy from the Great Recession that really flunked the “what it says on the tin” test was quantitative easing. </p><p>I think if you really understand how monetary policy works and have confidence in the Federal Reserve staff, then you’ll see that having the Fed buy a bunch of longer-term bonds is really not that exciting or weird. But most people don’t. </p><p>And unfortunately, as you become better-informed about monetary issues, it doesn’t actually become that much clearer why the Fed decided this would be a good thing to do. During a funny 2014 Brookings appearance, Ben Bernanke <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b164d2e-4f03-11e4-9c88-00144feab7de">quipped</a> that “the problem with quantitative easing is that it works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory.”</p><p>But think about that in terms of a low-trust society; the guy we’re supposed to trust to do the QE himself says he can’t give an explanation of how it works. </p><ul><li><p>Now of course you can read <a href="https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/10/bernankes-speech-how-does-quantitative-easing-work-will-it-work.html">Tim Duy offer five mechanisms through which QE could work</a> back in 2010 — but he’s skeptical that the tools are powerful.</p></li><li><p>By 2016, Roger Farmer says that Bernanke is wrong and QE <em>does</em> work in theory, and <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/why-unconventional-monetary-policy-works-theory">offers a theoretical account of why it works</a> that is somewhat different from any of Duy’s theories.</p></li><li><p>By 2020, Bernanke has come around to the view that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2020/01/04/the-new-tools-of-monetary-policy/">he now understands why QE works in theory</a>, though his view is closer to Duy’s than to Farmer’s. </p></li></ul><p>If you’re an insider to macroeconomic policy discussions, Bernanke’s quote is funny. But I think given all this, it’s …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/microcks-asyncapi-part2/microcks-kafka-distribs.webp" alt="Post cover image"><p>On our <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/microcks-asyncapi-part1">first AsyncAPI blog post</a> we have introduced <a href="https://microcks.io/blog/microcks-1.0.0-release/">Microcks 1.0 General Availability (GA)</a> as a unique milestone for mocking and testing event-driven API like any other APIs through the support of AsyncAPI specification.</p><p>In case you missed it, we have already released <a href="https://microcks.io/blog/microcks-1.1.0-release/">version 1.1.0</a> in the meantime. This release includes some nice enhancements related to the topic of the day: <strong>Microcks + AsyncAPI use cases using Apache Kafka</strong>. This post will show you how Microcks is leveraging the AsyncAPI specification on Kafka in a very pragmatic and powerful approach: way beyond documentation or code generation! We will also go through the different business use-cases implemented by users integrating Microcks in their asynchronous API toolchain.</p><p>When we are talking about Kafka we mean all Kafka distributions translated into <em>the choice is yours</em>: from vanilla Apache upstream distribution, to enterprise products and also cloud providers’ managed distributions!</p><p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/microcks-asyncapi-part2/microcks-kafka-distribs.webp" alt="microcks-kafka-distribs"></p><blockquote><p>By the way, we will be happy to have some QA <a href="https://github.com/microcks/microcks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributors and reports</a><undefined> on more brokers and AsyncAPI supported protocols <span role="img" aria-label="winking face">😉</span></undefined></p></blockquote><p>Before diving into AsyncAPI on Apache Kafka, let first see why simulating producers is a key project success factor.</p><h2 id="why-simulating-producers-is-a-key-project-success-factor">Why simulating producers is a key project success factor?</h2><p><undefined>As good developers, we are lazy - in a very good way <span role="img" aria-label="winking face">😉</span> - and hate to restart from scratch our beautiful code implementations due to misunderstanding with Product Owners. However, nowadays Product Owners adopted and love the </undefined><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2018/09/15/the-foolishness-of-fail-fast-fail-often/">Fail-Fast Principle</a>. We can't rely on functional implementations to start beta testing with consumers, we should fail fast and make them change requirements before we start implementation.</p><p>Apart from generating frustrations, this above situation is also very inefficient from a cost and time to market point of view for the organization. </p><p>The contract-first approach is a wonderful way to create strong and efficient agreements between functional / business / product owners and developers! But it represents only a partial answer to the above situation</p><p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/microcks-asyncapi-part2/time-money-quality.webp" alt="time-money-quality"></p><p>To avoid unnecessary work from developers and speed-up feedback gathering from consumers, simulation is the second part of the answer. That is why Microck's first use case and the killer feature is mocking!</p><p>These are some of the reasons why the way to do mocking with Microcks is highly scalable: </p><ul><li>We rely 100% on Product Owners contracts </li><li>We rely 100% on standards and specifications to describe contracts</li><li>We automatically generate all APIs mocks from contracts: no code!</li><li>We publish APIs mocks like real implementations using specifications examples </li><li>We centralize all contracts and are the single point of trust</li><li>We are always in sync with your repositories: no drift anymore!</li><li>We provide sandbox at scale. You can heavily stress tests your business rules. Remember, we are Kubernetes-native!</li></ul><p>This is why Microcks is the ultimate way to test, iterate and speed-up your APIs validations before asking developers to code the real implementation! And this certainly applies to asynchronous API on Kafka too: thanks to <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0">AsyncAPI specification</a>.</p><p>Now let’s start with first feature: mocking asynchronous API.</p><h2 id="mocking-asynchronous-api-on-top-of-apache-kafka">Mocking asynchronous API on top of Apache Kafka</h2><p>This is how Microcks value proposition of accelerating Kafka asynchronous API simulation looks like:</p><p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/microcks-asyncapi-part2/microcks-kafka-mocking.webp" alt="microcks-kafka-mocking"></p><p>In a very pragmatic approach, Microcks uses your AsyncAPI specification as the source of truth for your simulation. As soon as it is imported into Microcks, it manages to create a topic for your API version on the connected Kafka broker and starts publishing mock messages. Messages are published at a configured frequency and thus consumers immediately start receiving event messages as if it is published by a real application. Thanks to Microcks’ <a href="https://microcks.io/documentation/using/advanced/templates/">message templating</a> you can also easily include dynamic content in the sample messages.</p><p>Mocking event-driven architecture using Microcks is a game-changer as you do not need to write code nor set up complex infrastructure! Your consumers can receive messages in the minute. Testing some changes is just one commit away. You update the AsyncAPI specification in the Git repository and Microcks will take care of updating everything! It's even capable of providing and managing the Kafka infrastructure thanks to the excellent <a href="https://strimzi.io/">Strimzi.io</a> operator if you wish! See our <a href="https://microcks.io/documentation/installing/deployment-options/#everything-managed-by-microcks">Everything managed by Microcks</a><undefined> deployment option <span role="img" aria-label="rocket">🚀</span></undefined></p><p>Our second feature is testing or how to make your delivery lifecycle reliable.</p><h2 id="how-to-make-your-delivery-lifecycle-reliable">How to make your delivery lifecycle reliable?</h2><p>As the number of event producers and subscribers is exploding, managing changes and taking care of versioning compatibility is essential. And what about checking that business rules implying event triggering are correctly implemented? The fact it produces syntactically correct events and all this in a fully automated way based on each change and new commit in your source code repository?</p><p>Again this is all provided by Microcks thanks to its capability to interoperate with your CI/CD pipeline using our plugins for <a href="https://microcks.io/documentation/automating/jenkins/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://microcks.io/documentation/automating/tekton/">Tekton</a> or <a href="https://microcks.io/documentation/automating/cli/">any other CI pipeline technology like GitLab</a>. You'll typically use these plugins to trigger a Kafka test in Microcks.</p><p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/microcks-asyncapi-part2/microcks-kafka-testing.webp" alt="microcks-kafka-testing"></p><p>In Microcks, testing Kafka endpoints means connecting to a remote Kafka topic on an existing broker in the organization, listening for incoming messages, and checking that received messages are valid against the event-based API schema that is referenced in your source of truth: the AsyncAPI specification. You can find further technical details on the blog post <a href="https://microcks.io/blog/apache-kafka-mocking-testing/">mocking and testing Apache Kafka API using Microcks</a>.</p><p>Testing of event-driven architecture is no longer a nightmare with Microcks! Microcks can connect to the Kafka brokers in your organization and tell you if the received messages are valid according to your specification. No drifting risks anymore or way to introduce regression in production! You'll drive and control everything from your pipeline.</p><p>What are the business use-cases of AsyncAPI? Where can you use Microcks as an essential part of your toolchain?</p><h2 id="business-use-cases-of-asyncapi">Business use-cases of AsyncAPI</h2><p>As said before, event-driven and asynchronous APIs are becoming mainstream because we truly understand the decoupling level - and thus power and agility - it brings within our products. We see the need for asynchronous APIs and Apache Kafka's presence as the de facto standard for message brokering - everywhere.</p><ul><li>In every business vertical: to decouple a recording action (registration, purchase, like) to a marketing reaction (CRM update, behavioral analysis, marketing notification, renewal process management, etc...)</li><li>In Governmental organizations: to synchronize complex and partitioned repositories using master data management and staging pipelines techniques</li><li>In Financial Services: to streamline the sharing of information between core platforms and distribution ecosystems of partners,</li><li>In Industry: to enable Industry 4.0 to use IoT and become more agile to respond to market unpredictability and improve quality,</li><li>Soon in every Citizen's life: to power tomorrow Smart Cities with IoT and enable smart real-time insights and decision making.</li></ul><p>These use cases come from companies using Microcks for simulating and testing their API implementation, and we are thankful to our users and community.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>We are convinced that cutting edge developers understand the purpose, usages, and efficiency of asynchronous mechanisms. To take all its advantages and especially to use an AsyncAPI contract-first approach: developers must work hand in hand with software architects, business/product owners within the enterprise. In our humble opinion, this is clearly a strong point of attention to improve collaboration between enterprise silos and take the quintessence of AsyncAPI specification for a contract-first approach using Microcks as the ultimate tooling for mocking and testing purposes. Please read our <a href="https://microcks.io/blog/continuous-testing-all-your-apis/">previous blog post on this topic</a><undefined> and share it with your software architects <span role="img" aria-label="winking face">😉</span></undefined></p><p>We hope these two Microcks features - mocking and testing - and application use-cases are clear and you now better understand our value proposition. Microcks proposes a very pragmatic and powerful usage of AsyncAPI specification: way beyond documentation or code generation! It allows you to speed-up and makes your delivery of Kafka event-driven architectures reliable.</p><p>The roadmap ahead is also full of exciting new features we are looking forward to: </p><ul><li>Continuing to make AsyncAPI full potential bloom through implementing multiple schema format supports - like Apache Avro - and <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/issues/329">adding examples in the spec</a>,</li><li>Taking advantage of multiple protocol binding capabilities, releasing very soon a <a href="https://github.com/microcks/microcks/issues/293">MQTT implementation</a> to support our users and prospects on the IoT landscape,</li><li>Solidifying an initiative we started a long time ago about a shared repository of simulation and test suites for standards or products APIs...</li></ul><p>We are open and you can help make Microcks an even greater tool!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page">







<div id="pagebody">

<section id="content" role="main">
<p>Backup systems could do with a common backup interchange format.</p>
<p>Many version control systems support the git “<a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-fast-export">fast-export</a>” format. It’s a simple format for exporting the contents of a version control repository so that it can be imported into another. It’s a fundamental basis for converting from one system to another.</p>
<p>Backup systems could have something similar. It would be a good to everyone as it frees people to change backup systems without having their backup history locked into their old system. There are several scenarios in which this could be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Migrating to a new backup system that can’t read backups made with the old backup system.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating from one backup repository to another, when a straight copy of the repository files is not possible, for whatever reason. For example, if there is no file-level access to the backup repository, only a constrained API.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating to a new configuration that can’t read backups made with the old backup system. For example, changing encryption secrets in a system that only allows one per repository.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My initial requirements for such a format:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s as simple as possible while still working. It doesn’t need to be efficient, only efficient enough to be practical to use.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s possible to stream the format: something like <code>oldbackup export | newbackup import</code> should be possible.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s as independent of the backup systems as possible, and doesn’t embed unnecessary assumptions of the design or implementation of the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My first sketch of a backup interchange format:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sequence of backup generations in order they were made.</li>
<li>Each generation has some metadata, and a list of files and hardlinhks.</li>
<li>Each file has an identifie unique to the generation, metadata (inode) and file content.</li>
<li>File content is a sequence of (offset, blob) pairs, to support sparse files.</li>
<li>Hard links are represented as (pathname, inode) pairs, where the first pathname is the name of the hard link, the</li>
<li>No attempt at de-duplication or re-using files from a previous generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As YAML, this would look something like this:</p>

<p>YAML used here as an example, actual format may be something else.</p>

<p>Most likely, it’s only you who thinks you're not good enough. Your “operating system” has a bug that raises too many instances of <code>NotGoodEnoughException</code>.</p>
<p>Even if someone else thinks you're not good enough, it's probably because they have this bug too. People climb many hierarchies—power, money, popularity, etc., and in doing so, they advertently, but more often than not, inadvertently put other people down to lift themselves. Have this in mind when someone is rude to you.</p>
<p>How to fix this bug? The solution is not that hard, but it requires time + effort. What you have to do is first install the <code><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=eckhart+tolle">mindfulness</a></code> module. This module interrupts the cognitive module each time NotGoodEnoughException is raised and puts the handling of this exception at the top of the priority queue. In a sense, good mindfulness could be compared to having decent server logs—situational awareness for the self.</p>
<p>If you think the above paragraph is written poorly, your “OS” probably raised NotGoodEnoughException just now ;)</p>
<p>You handle the exception as follows. Get familiar with the <code>/self/v2/mind</code> API endpoint and make a POST request with the following body each time NotGoodEnoughException is raised:</p>
<pre>{
  "youAreEnough": true
}
</pre>
<p>It might take weeks, months, or even years before the number of exceptions starts to drop, but it <em>does</em> drop. The reason this works is that it’s the real you, the one who experiences pain, joy, and life, the one above thoughts, emotions, and sensations, who decides to “program” your “kernel”. The key is within you.</p>
<p>To supercharge, consider running <code>install patience --save-dev</code> and opening an issue at the <code>friend/talk</code> repository.</p>
<p>Take care!</p>

<p><em>It is interesting again at the cryptocurrency market if you have missed the latest news. The price of Bitcoin has broken records of the three-year remoteness, with a rate of over $30,000. Opinions about the future of the coin are divided – some believe that we are facing another bubble. In contrast, others believe that the financial market will no longer be the same and that Bitcoin will be much more expensive in the long run. I admit I am not quite sure what is going on. But I am sure ignoring it is at least weird, so I tried to figure out a little bit about what is going on, and in this article, I am going to share my thoughts on whether it is worth invest in Bitcoin.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="846" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1024x846.png" alt="Bitcoin to dollar rate - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="Bitcoin to dollar rate" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1024x846.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-300x248.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-768x634.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1536x1269.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-700x578.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em>Bitcoin to dollar rate</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Reasons to pay attention to Bitcoin</h2>



<p>If you have entirely closed financial affairs, enough life savings, and complete confidence in the reliability of the financial instruments you use, then you do not have to.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you believe that your daily needs are at the level you need at any time in your life, they will always be closed by your salary or business income. Namely, you are the kind of person who believes that there is real stability in our rapidly changing world with the regularly appearing “The Black Swan”.</p>



<p>Put, you either have enough money, or you have modest needs and indiscreet self-confidence. In that case, I guess you do not have to.</p>



<p>I am in a different situation. I do not believe in stability and see the absence of demand for many “lifelong professions” and the devaluation of savings and the meager pensions that people have worked for decades.</p>



<p>For that reason, I am interested in risk diversification. In professions, in businesses, in financial instruments. The latter today is the talk. I am willing to explore and consider any possibility to save the money I make and multiply it.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is such a tool. Subprime, perhaps with a foggy future – but a tool. And therefore – it is, at least, worthy of study.</p>



<h2>How to save money</h2>



<p>Some «experts» <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-6-bitcoin-price-predictions-to-watch-in-2021">claim</a> that the price of Bitcoin will reach $100,000, others forecast $300,000, of course, some say that even the figure of $1,000,000 for BTC is quite real. But what (and when, which is no less critical) will be the course, no one knows. All these statements are more like the publicity move of those who make them.</p>



<p>I am more interested in the other thing. When we talk about the Bitcoin rate, we peg it, for example, to US dollar. As we think it is the most reliable currency. But if we are talking about retaining the money for a long time, no financial advisor will ever advise you to keep all the money in it. The investment code indicates that it is necessary to buy different currencies and use other financial instruments (for example, stocks and bonds) to cover risks.</p>



<p>The dollar is rapidly going cheaper. Or everything becomes expensive. You can call it anything you want, but the point is the same. Everyone has examples. Some people rely on official statistics. I will bring out my life’s specifics by just looking at the significant expenses in my wallet. Ten years ago, the iPhone was sold for $499. A standard hotel room could be rented for $50. The price of real estate 20-30 years ago is not even worth remembering.</p>



<p>It is about inflation and about the complex interest that is often the problem. We may think that the numbers are changing slowly, but how in investment capitalisation of interest rates creates miracles and inflation produces a rapid depreciation of savings.</p>



<p>Let us talk about the US. The country with a strong economy, producing the dollar we are talking about. The average annual official <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/">inflation</a> is 2.06%. Many may even say that it can be neglected. Perhaps. If it were not for the capitalization of interest. The purchasing power of $100 in 2000 is equal to the purchasing power of $150 in 2020. And that’s average, groceries have gone up less, and for example, education have gone up much more.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="649" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1024x649.png" alt="The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1024x649.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-300x190.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-768x487.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1536x974.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-700x444.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation.png 1820w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em><strong><em>The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>And so, again, back to the primary council on finance: to save, you must diversify risks. Real estate, gold, stocks – everyone chooses their instruments.</p>



<blockquote><p>We must remember – person who does not choose any financial instruments and keeps his dollars in bank account is getting poorer.</p></blockquote>



<p>The stock market has been considered a haven for many years. If you do not take a significant risk and do not try to overplay the market – it does help save, at least by covering inflation and, as a maximum allowing you to make money on investments.</p>



<p>But what we see today? Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, vast numbers of people were unemployed, and governments began to pay them various benefits. To cover the budget deficit, $3.5 trillion was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2020/05/12/coronavirushow-u-s-printing-dollars-save-economy-during-crisis-fed/3038117001/">printed</a> only in the United States. Just think about the number of new money that was newly printed and put on the market. We will not even talk about the fact that the dollar <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp">has not been backed </a>by gold for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What happened in the stock market in 2020 could not be imagined by even the most optimistic analyst. In a year of pandemics, mass unemployment, and stagnant economies, it grows like crazy.</p>

<p>There is no tourism. Restaurants are closed. The State prints and gives out money. People spend it on stocks. Now it’s so conveniently done on the mobile app that even regulators already have <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/investing/robinhood-sec-settlement-deceptive-practices/index.html">questions</a> about this simplicity and gameplay.</p>



<p>People who never cared about stocks went to the stock market. And they started buying familiar brands. Economics? No, no one else cares. All that matters are the names that are in the public eye. Tesla’s case study is that the capitalization of the company has grown almost tenfold over the year. And its sales <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue">went</a> up…15 percent.</p>

<p>Whether there will be a collapse is not a valid question. A more appropriate question is when it will be. Even the most experienced experts are difficult to answer. Politicians have come into play, and the printing press is not yet scheduled to shut down. I do not doubt that there is a bubble in the stock market.</p>



<h2>And Bitcoin growth in 2020 is not a bubble?</h2>



<p>Now let us look at what is going on in the cryptocurrency market. At first glance, the situation there is remarkably similar to the stock market. Coins are rapidly expensive, and events are reminiscent of 2017. But there are several significant differences.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin has not risen in price due to media publications</h3>



<p>It only got on the news agenda after the price exceeded the three-year-old record. And if in 2017 the attention of «housewives» was focused on cryptocurrencies, today they do not invest in bitcoin – their focus is the stock market. In Google Trends, Bitcoin awareness has <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=bitcoin">increased</a>, but it is by order of magnitude less than three years earlier.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="361" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoingoogletrends-2048x721-1-1024x361.png" alt="Interest to Bitcoin in Google Trends - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="Interest to Bitcoin in Google Trends - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoingoogletrends-2048x721-1-1024x361.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoingoogletrends-2048x721-1-300x106.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoingoogletrends-2048x721-1-768x270.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoingoogletrends-2048x721-1-1536x541.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoingoogletrends-2048x721-1-700x246.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoingoogletrends-2048x721-1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em>Interest to Bitcoin in Google Trends</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Institutional investors join the Bitcoin market</h3>



<p>The growth of 2020 is mainly due to the investment business entry. Quoted on the stock market, MicroStrategy also invest in bitcoin – company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/microstrategy-to-raise-400-million-to-buy-even-more-bitcoin">purchased</a> 38,250 btc this year (at current rates of $1 billion). The largest payment services, Stripe and PayPal, began working with this cryptocurrency. Square allows customers to use the cryptocurrency as payment, and PayPal <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">permitted</a> customers to buy Bitcoin directly from their PayPal accounts.</p>



<p>More and more professional invest in Bitcoin. Even the conservative Ray Dalio (the CEO of one of the largest funds) recently stated that he might have been very categorical and not even right about the future of Bitcoin. “I need to look at the Bitcoin and study it more”, – he recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ray-dalio-bitcoin/">stated</a>. Cryptocurrencies are added to the portfolios of Ark Investment Management, Fidelity Investments, and other funds. And not just investments funds. Even some pension funds are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/pension-funds-double-crypto-asset-exposure-in-morgan-creeks-fund-to-1">starting</a> to invest in Bitcoin a small portion of their capital.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin is an alternative</h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier, in 2020, everything around us is volatile. Everything is feverish. Somewhere, bubbles are blowing up; somewhere; economies are falling. And capital, again, is looking for diversification. Because there is a lot of money globally, even a tiny fraction of it going to Bitcoin can cause the too high growth we see right now. Growth is driven by investment demand.</p>



<h2>Why bitcoin?</h2>



<p>Even those who are not familiar with the subject of cryptocurrencies have heard that <a href="https://orujaliev.com/invest-in-bitcoin/">Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency</a>. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. So why we talk about Bitcoin?</p>



<p>Bitcoin is finite. It is digital gold. Only much more convenient and liquid. The algorithm is programmed to make just 21 million coins. Now 18.5 million have been mined, but let us not forget that about 4 million are irretrievably lost according to various estimates. Theoretically, the algorithm can be modified, but to do so, 51% of the miners must join and vote for it. The situation is almost impossible because it will make their assets cheaper. </p>



<p>If you invest in bitcoin, bought one coin, you have and will have one. No State or politician can turn on the printing press and blur your share. Bitcoin is popular. There are hundreds of social networks globally, but Facebook owns the market because it overcame the critical group of users, and eventually, more people come there. Cryptocurrencies are similar. There are thousands coins. But <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/global-charts/">70 percent of all capitalization is Bitcoin</a>. If I may say so, it is a market standard. Attempts to create an alternative have been made and are underway, but none of them have succeeded precisely for that reason.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is convenient. No, it is not suitable to buy pizza in a restaurant. It has other challenges and opportunities. For example, it is useful to transfer large amounts of money between countries or to carry capital. You can have as many millions as you want in the account, fly to wherever you want …</p></div></div>

          <strong>Demystifying Avro and the secret schema registry protocol</strong>
          </p>
        </header>
      

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>From a bird’s-eye view, Avro is a binary serialization format just like many others: structured data can be serialized into a compact binary format to speed up the transport of data and to save storage space. However, when you take a closer look at Avro, fundamental differences to other established serialization schemes like Protobuf or Thrift become evident. In practice, those differences manifest themselves in a comparatively high compression ratio on the one hand, but an increase in complexity on the other.</p>

<p>Especially when employed in a distributed system, where serialized data is pushed over the wire, dealing with Avro becomes tricky. In particular, the concept of <strong>schema registries</strong> seems to be a common cause of confusion.</p>

<p>Everybody who has worked with an Avro/Kafka setup has probably at some point wondered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When in the application’s lifecycle should a schema be registered?</li>
  <li>When is a schema pulled from the schema registry?</li>
  <li>When does the compatibility check take place?</li>
  <li>Why do I even need to pull a schema when the schema is already baked into the application?</li>
  <li>Why did my application crash with a deserialization exception again?</li>
  <li>Can we use JSON, please?</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post may not have an answer to all of these questions but it’s a good starting point if you want to find out what goes on under the covers.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-point">What’s the point?</h2>
<p>Why are schema registries a thing? And why do you hear the term mostly in the context of Avro and not so much in the context of, say, Protobuf? 
In order to answer this we first have to understand how Avro is different from other protocols. One of the key differences is that binary protocols such as Protobuf and Thrift rely on <strong>tags</strong> as means to match byte sequences to fields, whereas in Avro, such a concept does not exist.</p>

<h3 id="tags-vs-no-tags">Tags vs. no tags</h3>
<p>Tags are a way of mapping each field of a schema to a unique number, an ID. Within a serialized record, we can refer to a field by its ID and not say, by it’s name as it is the case for JSON. The result is that the serialized byte sequence is a lot more concise (compare a single integer to variable-length string). When the deserializer traverses a binary record and encounters a tag then it knows that the byte sequence that follows belongs to the field associated with that tag.</p>

<p>Here’s an example…</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://davidhettler.net/assets/images/protobuf.png" alt="A serialized Protobuf record and its associated schema to demonstrate the use of tags">
  
    <figcaption>
      A serialized Protobuf record and its associated schema

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>On the left-hand side, you can see a Protobuf schema for the type “Animal” with three tags: the tags 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the fields “name”, “legs” and “hasTail”, respectively. On the right hand side, you can see a record which was serialized with that schema. We easily find that the animal in question is named “Lucy”, has four legs and a tail. You don’t have to understand every detail of the binary output, just know that the tags (marked in orange) tell the deserializer which bytes correspond to which field. This is important because the fields in the byte sequence are not in the same order as they were defined in the schema.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of tags is that they take up quite a bit of space (in the case of Protobuf it’s one byte per tag). In the image above, all bytes related to “meta data” are marked in grey, the remaining white boxes are the actual payload. You can see that the ratio between meta data (overhead) and payload data is not ideal. Can’t we reduce the number of grey boxes, e.g. by getting rid of tags? With Avro, we can. Avro does not rely on tags to identify fields. Instead, in the serialized byte sequence, all fields are appended back to back.</p>

<p>Here’s is the Avro equivalent of the Lucy example:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://davidhettler.net/assets/images/avro-record.png" alt="A serialized Avro record and its associated schema to demonstrate the use of tags">
  
    <figcaption>
      A serialized Avro record and its associated schema

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>Again, on the left hand side we see the schema, the <em>reader’s</em> schema to be precise. On the right hand side, the serialized record.</p>

<p>The first thing you might notice is that the record is quite a bit more compact. It takes up 30% less space than the Protobuf equivalent: 7 bytes vs. 10 bytes. The field values are marshaled byte-after-byte and there’s a lot less meta data within the record (fewer grey boxes).</p>

<p>Now you might be wondering: how does the deserializer know which byte sequence belongs to which field when there is no way of identifying the fields? How do we know that Lucy has four legs and not just one? Just by looking at the reader’s schema we cannot possibly know. In order to find out we need to look at the schema which the <strong>writer</strong> used when serializing the record. With both schemas side-by-side, we can make a comparison and find out the correct order of the fields.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://davidhettler.net/assets/images/side-by-side.png" alt="The writer's schema on the left and the reader's schema on the right. The order of records is mixed up.">
  
    <figcaption>
      Comparing the writer’s and the reader’s schema side-by-side

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>The order is all mixed up. According to the writer, <code>hasTail</code> should be at position one whereas according to the reader, it should be at position three, etc. But this is not a problem since the reader now has both schemas, they can reorder the fields and deserialize the record.</p>

<p>This approach, however, poses another problem: <strong>How does a reader know the writer’s schema?</strong> Here’s where the schema registry comes in.</p>

<h3 id="schema-registry-to-the-rescue">Schema registry to the rescue</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a schema registry is a store for schemas. It provides an interface that allows you to retrieve and register schemas and check each of the schemas for compatibility. Effectively, it is nothing more than a CRUD application with a RESTful API and a persistent storage for schema definitions. Within the schema registry, each schema is assigned a unique ID. The reader can simply query the schema registry for the writer’s schema ID and retrieve the schema definition.</p>

<p>Now, we still haven’t clarified how the writer tells the reader <em>which</em> schema was used for serialization. There are several ways to do this. In the context of Kafka, there is one established method which relies on the convention that the writer <strong>prepends each serialized record with its respective schema ID</strong> before it is sent over the wire. The reader can then parse the first few bytes to find out the schema ID and ask the schema registry for the schema definition. Only then, the reader can determine schema compatibility, reorder the schema’s fields and start deserializing.</p>

<p>I know this might be a bit confusing (at least it was for me) so let’s have a look at an example.</p>

<h2 id="the-protocol">The protocol</h2>
<p>In this example scenario, we’ll look at a publisher who wants to write the Avro-serialized message “Foo” to the topic “my_topic” and a subscriber who wants to read that record.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://davidhettler.net/assets/images/example.png" alt="The example scenario expressed as diagram. A publisher sends a message to a subscriber over a Kafka topic.">
  
    <figcaption>
      An example scenario

    </figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="the-writers-side">The writer’s side</h3>

<p>Let’s first have a look at the left half of the image and take the writer’s perspective.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://davidhettler.net/assets/images/publisher.png" alt="A diagram depicing the protocol flow from the publisher's perspective.">
  
    <figcaption>
      The writer’s side

    </figcaption></figure>

<ol>
  <li>So we want to write the message “Foo” to the topic “my_topic”. While developing the application, we already determined the schema that we want to use. So technically, we could already serialize the record and publish it. Except, we can’t. Remember: With Avro, we need to signal which schema was used for serialization so that readers can check for compatibility and deserialize. In order to do this, we need the schema’s unique ID. How do we know the correct schema ID? Only the schema registry knows, so let’s ask it.</li>
  <li>We ask the schema registry: “Hey, I want to publish a record to “my_topic” using <em>this particular</em> schema. Is that alright, and if so could you tell me which schema ID to use?”. We do this by calling the <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/develop/api.html#post--subjects-(string-%20subject)-versions">API’s registration endpoint</a>. The endpoint expects an Avro schema in the request body. We’re going to put the schema we planned to use inside of it.</li>
  <li>The schema registry receives the request and looks up the schema in its persistent storage (a log-compacted topic named “_schemas”). If no schema is yet registered for the topic (what I refer to as “topic” is actually “subject” in schema registry terms) then the schema is registered and persisted.</li>
  <li>The schema registry compares the schema that it just looked up with the schema that we POSTed. If the schemas are incompatible according to <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/avro.html#schema-evolution-and-compatibility">Avro’s schema compatibility rules</a>, a client error (409) is returned to us. But in this example we’re good, the schemas are compatible and the schema ID is returned. Let’s assume that the ID is “5”.</li>
  <li>Great, so we have green light to use our schema for serialization. We serialize the record and find its binary repesentation is “<code>06 46 6F 6F</code>”.</li>
  <li>Now we can prepend the message with the schema ID and publish the record. Off we go!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-readers-side">The reader’s side</h3>

<p>Now let’s look at the other half of the image and slip into the role of the consumer.</p>

      The reader’s side

    </figcaption></figure>

<ol>
  <li>As a consumer we’re notified about a new record in the “my_topic” topic that the writer previously published to. How do we deserialize the record? We already <em>know</em> which schema to use for deserialization: while writing the application we defined that “for <em>this</em> particular topic we use <em>that</em> particular schema”. But why can’t we just use our own schema and be done with it? The answer is that, again, <strong>Avro needs both the writer and the reader schema in order to identify which bytes correspond to which field</strong> and to determine whether the schemas are compatible. So we need to retrieve the writer’s schema from the schema registry. We look at the first few bytes of the message and discover that the writer used the schema ID “5”.</li>
  <li>We ask the schema registry which schema is associated with schema “5” by calling the corresponding <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/develop/api.html#get--schemas-ids-int-%20id">API endpoint</a>.</li>
  <li>Again, a lookup in the persistent store is made.</li>
  <li>The endpoint returns the schema definition associated with schema ID 5.</li>
  <li>We compare the returned schema with the schema that we planned to use. By looking at the two schemas side-by-side we can identify each field and also determine whether the schemas are compatible. If everything is ok we can finally deserialize the record and read the original message.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This story starts with me having to simulate a faulty disk device for testing.
The Linux Kernel Device mapper is a good solution for this, so i created a
faulty device with a simple file backend:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>truncate</span> <span>-s</span> 1G /tmp/baddisk
 losetup /dev/loop2 /tmp/baddisk
 dmsetup create baddisk <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>EOF</span><span> 
    0 6050 linear /dev/loop2 0
    6050 155 error
    6205 2090947 linear /dev/loop2 6205 
 EOF</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These commands setup a new device on <em>/dev/mapper/baddisk</em> with <em>1GB</em> of size.
Starting from sector <em>6050</em>, there are <em>155</em> faulty sectors, where any write and
read operation should cause I/O errors.</p>

<p>I went on and used <em>dd</em> to write to the device, as the first faulty block
should start around <em>3MB</em>, i used the following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>To my surprise, the command succeeded. I assumed some error in my setup and
after re-creating the device mapper target, i tried again. This time with the
following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk
 <span>dd</span>: writing to <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error
 3096576 bytes <span>(</span>3.1 MB, 3.0 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0238947 s, 130 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Nice, the device behaves as expected! While taking notes in another terminal
and switching back and forth workspaces, i issued the following command again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>What? It succeeded writing <em>4.1MB</em> of data to a faulty segment of the disk
which should clearly fail! This was strange, but still, after many attempts
with this command writing to the complete device until it got end of space, no
I/O errors were reported by <em>dd</em>.</p>

<p>Looking at the <em>dmesg</em> output, the kernel correctly reported errors with the
underlying device:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> Buffer I/O error on dev dm-3, logical block 757, lost async page write
 <span>[</span>..]</code></pre></figure>

<p>And running <em>badblocks</em> on the device also correctly reported them.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> does dd not report this error?</p>

<p>The difference between the commands is the used block size, so i assumed some
caching beeing the cause for this situation, or maybe dd opening the file with
different flags like O_DIRECT or O_SYNC if smaller block sizes are used?</p>

<p>I straced the <em>dd</em> command and the openat/write and close functions behaved
exacly the same, this time i used a <em>5MB</em> block size for simpler debugging:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> openat<span>(</span>AT_FDCWD, <span>"/dev/mapper/baddisk"</span>, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 3
 write<span>(</span>1, <span>"</span><span>\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0</span><span>"</span>..., 5242880<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 5242880
 close<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>                                <span>=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>The strace output shows that the succeeding command opens the file without any
notable difference to the command writing with 512 bytes block size.  The write
and close functions return with no error whatsoever. <em>dd</em> simply does not
notice the data loss while writing to the storage!</p>

<p>Making <em>dd</em> use the <em>O_DIRECT</em> flag during file open, or the <em>O_SYNC</em> option
catches the error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>5M <span>oflag</span><span>=</span>direct
 <span>dd</span>: error writing <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the reason for this? I assume dd, with its standard block size of 512
bytes does not the hit the linux kernels buffered I/O. And with bigger block
sizes, the I/O becomes buffered, async, and as it stands, dd as user space
application does not validate the write operation (using fsync) to notice
errors during buffered I/O operations by default.</p>

<p>This leads us to my next finding: “the linux fsync() gate” that dates back to
2018, starting with the following question on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42434872/writing-programs-to-cope-with-i-o-errors-causing-lost-writes-on-linux">Writing programs to cope with I/O errors causing lost writes on Linux
</a></p>

<p>And resulting LWN articles:</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/">Improved block-layer error handling</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">PostgreSQL’s fsync() surprise</a></p>

<p>which provide great insight into the linux kernels error handling and how these
errors are upstreamed to user space applications while writing data to faulty
devices.</p>

<p>Long story short: If one uses <em>dd</em> with a bigger block size <em>(&gt;= 4096)</em>, be
sure to use either the <em>oflag=direct</em> or <em>conv=fsync</em> option to have proper
error reporting while writing data to a device. I would prefer <em>conv=fsync</em>, dd
will then <em>fsync()</em> the file handle once and report the error, without having
the performance impact which <em>oflag=direct</em> has.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1500 <span>conv</span><span>=</span>fsync
<span>dd</span>: fsync failed <span>for</span> <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<p>You are able to find answers to almost all common questions on Google. But there are some areas where Google fails to provide good answers.</p>
<p>Personally or me when it comes to looking for an answer for a highly technical question in medicine, Google doesn’t do well in providing good answers.</p>
<p>Most of the results are not directing me to pages that I’m looking for, or they show me research articles that are not scientifically validates or are not included in the guidelines. So both occasions are not valuable for me.</p>
<p>But the answers can be found in text books if you can look hard enough. The answer is not available on Google not because that there is an answer, but because either no one has put the answer to the internet or not discovered by Google.</p>
<p>Yes, highly niche searches may not have a good market, because doctors and medical students looking for answers does not count for a huge traffic.</p>
<p><strong>But still if someone wants to build a good search engine, a good starting point maybe to look for a very niche field where Google is not performing well, and build on top of it.</strong></p>
<h2>QuestionHub by Google</h2>
<p>Google also maybe understanding the fact that that their systems and AI is not good enough to find answers to some highly specific questions or long tail keywords.</p>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://questionhub.withgoogle.com/intl/en/" target="_blank">Question Hub by Google</a> is a service quietly launched by Google to improve their search engine when it comes to these non specific or highly specific questions, and long tail keywords .</p>

<p>With Question Hub, Google is hoping to get help from people to improve their search experience for these kinds of queries.</p>
<p>Currently users from the USA, India, Nigeria, and Indonesia can contribute to Questions by Google. However, someone accessed the platform by using a VPN and shared this screenshot in one Facebook group.</p>

<p>By looking at the screenshot, it appears that it’s a Quora like service, where people can add questions, and also contribute with answers and content.</p>
<p>People who rely on advertising can find commonly asked questions and and create content for it, and in turn get traffic and increase their ad revenue.</p>
<p>And Google can improve their knowledge graph and improve their service by providing a better service for its users.</p>
<p>It can be a win win situation for advertises, Google, users and content creators.</p>
<h2><strong>Downside</strong> </h2>
<p>Question Hub can have its shortcomings. For example, this can lead to more <strong>blog spam or SEO spam</strong>, because content creators can create spammy content for these questions.</p>
<p>Google also has a history of killing services once they achieved their targets (bait and switch). Who knows whether Google will do the same for their Question Hub platform, and kill it once they get enough information for their knowledge graph.</p>
<p>So what’s your idea about Question Hub? Can it lead to a better web?</p>

                    <p>Received my Bondic kit yesterday and it has exceeded my expectations. I tested it on some bolts, a couple pieces of wood and metal, and it did a great job. Also, it’s very easy to use and cures in seconds.</p>

                    <p>Fast shipping and it comes in a nice little case! I’ve used it a couple times now and I have to admit that it’s a great alternative to glue.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been using Bondic for the last couple months. I’ve used up the first tube for about 8-12 repairs and little projects which is pretty nice. But it all depends on the size of the object and the amount you use. I’ve already ordered an extra pack of refills with 50% off.</p>

                    <p>I was a bit worried that this wouldn’t work for the project I’m working on, but it worked just fine! Using Bondic is easier and faster than glue.</p>

                    <p>Mine came in a few weeks ago. Works fine! I’ve used it to repair and insulate a couple wires and I must say that I’m impressed. It’s cures superfast and it’s very easy to use. I definitely recommend this product.</p>

                    <p>Works much better than superglue. It doesn’t make a mess and you can reposition the parts until you want to harden the repair and make it permanent. Also, it works right out of the box, so no need to buy batteries for the UV light.</p>

                    <p>This is perfect for crafts and repairs. It can do so much more than glue and it comes in a nice little box!</p>

                    <p>It works like a charm, but shipping was quite slow. It took more than 2 weeks.</p>

<p>If you are here I assume that you probably donâ€™t know PHP nor Wordpress, and so you decided to built a static web page or use some static
page generator like Jekyll, Grav or GatsbyJS. Right now your obvious option to provide ability to create a
contact from is using a <a href="https://formspree.io/">formspree.io</a> or something similar. Iâ€™m going to show you how to write your own contact form â€˜backendâ€™ in very short time.</p>
<p><img src="https://jpomykala.com/assets/2018-08-04/lambda.png" alt="lambda"></p>
<p>Please remember that this is not a step by step tutorial, Iâ€™m describing overall architecture with the code (<em>copy-paste ready</em> certification).
If you have any remarks, write a comment in section below or <a href="https://github.com/jpomykala/jpomykala.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-08-04-serverless-contact-form-on-static-page.md">create a Github issue</a>. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>minimal knowledge about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a></li>
<li>basic JavaScript skills</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="used-technologies">Used technologies</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Lambda</a></li>

<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="demo">Demo</h3>
<p>Same technique I used in many websites, here is one example.</p>
<p><a href="https://vendingmetrics.com/contact">https://vendingmetrics.com/contact</a></p>
<p>So far I didnâ€™t have any issue with this solution.</p>
<h3 id="build-environment">Build environment</h3>
<p>If you are familiar with used technologies the diagram should be pretty straightforward for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://jpomykala.com/assets/2018-08-04/architecture-diagram.png" alt="aws-lambda-function"></p>
<p>Static web page should be gathering data from contact form, validate and send them using XHR Fetch, jQuery or in
other way to API Gateway by POST method. API Gateway will invoke Lambda function, and the Lambda function will invoke
our JavaScript code where we parse POST request, do some custom logic and call <code>sendEmail(...)</code> on SES service.</p>
<h3 id="0-verify-e-mail-address">0. Verify e-mail address</h3>
<p>E-mail address verification can be done <a href="https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=eu-west-1#verified-senders-email:">here (eu-west-1)</a></p>
<p><img src="https://jpomykala.com/assets/2018-08-04/ses-verification.png" alt="ses-verification"></p>
<h3 id="1-lambda-function">1. Lambda Function</h3>
<p>We will start with creating Lambda function and choosing NodeJS 8.1 environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jpomykala/a3548903e3454f7d65443053ec412b65">The full code can be found on GitHub Gist</a></p>
<h6 id="import-aws-sdk">import <code>aws-sdk</code></h6>
<p>When we have prepared environment we can start to implement the function. First important thing is that we need to import <code>aws-sdk</code> to use SES and other Amazon services.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>aws</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>aws-sdk</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/index.html">Link to <code>aws-sdk</code> documentation</a></p>
<h6 id="lambda-responses">Lambda responses</h6>
<p>Success and error responses. This part is more important than you think. If we return wrong JSON from lambda function to API Gateway,
the client (contact form in this case) will get HTTP 500 status. Code will be invoked and email sent anyway, but itâ€™s just a good practise to
follow the documentation.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>successResponse</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"</span><span>statusCode</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span>

<span>};</span>

<span>const</span> <span>errorResponse</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>"</span><span>isBase64Encoded</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>
<h6 id="check-is-domain-allowed">Check is domain allowed</h6>
<p>By using this function we can easily turn on and off e-mail sending from certain domains.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>extractDomain</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>emailSplit</span> <span>=</span> <span>emailAddress</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>@</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>arraySize</span> <span>=</span> <span>emailSplit</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>arraySize</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2</span><span>){</span>
        <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>warn</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Domain not found for email:</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>emailAddress</span><span>);</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>emailSplit</span><span>[</span><span>arraySize</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>

 <span>const</span> <span>allowedDomains</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'</span><span>example.com</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>jpomykala.me</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>yourdomain.com</span><span>'</span><span>];</span>
 <span>const</span> <span>isDomainAllowed</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>domain</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>allowedDomains</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>domain</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<h6 id="e-mail-message">E-mail message</h6>
<p>This is a true strength of this solution. We are passing whole Javascript object from contact form to e-mail formatted
with <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tags and <code>JSON.stringify</code>.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>getEmailMessage</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>

                <span>Data</span><span>:</span> <span>`
                    &lt;body&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;</span><span>${</span><span>request</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;pre&gt;</span><span>${</span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>undefined</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)}</span><span>&lt;/pre&gt;
                    &lt;/body&gt;
                    `</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>},</span>
        <span>Subject</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<h6 id="send-e-mail-by-ses">Send e-mail by SES</h6>
<p>The most important part of this function is of course sending email by SES. We create a params with message,
subject and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/SES.html">all other options which can be found here.</a></p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"> <span>const</span> <span>params</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>ReplyToAddresses</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>request</span><span>.</span><span>_replyTo</span><span>]</span>
    <span>};</span>


    <span>const</span> <span>sendPromise</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>aws</span><span>.</span><span>SES</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.</span><span>sendEmail</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>promise</span><span>();</span>

    <span>await</span> <span>sendPromise</span>

            <span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>errorResponse</span><span>);</span>
        <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we can deploy our function and move to API Gateway.</p>
<p><img src="https://jpomykala.com/assets/2018-08-04/send-mail-fuction-aws.png" alt="aws-lambda-function"></p>
<h3 id="2-api-gateway">2. API Gateway</h3>
<p>Setting up API Gateway for Lambda functions, should be straightforward. There is no need to code any thing, just click-and-play configuration.
In this case I setup my endpoint to receive any http method. For working contact form you will need only <code>http/post</code> method.
<img src="https://jpomykala.com/assets/2018-08-04/api-gateway.png" alt="api-gateway"></p>
<h6 id="things-to-remember">Things to remember</h6>
<ul>
<li>Every time we change something on endpoint configuration we need deploy API again to see changes. <code>Actions -&gt; Deploy API</code></li>
<li>Remember about setting up CORS while using API Gateway. <code>Actions -&gt; Enable CORS</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We can scale this technique to multiple web pages with ease, but this solution in current form has few downsides.
For now the only one protection against DDoS or some similar attack is rate limiter included in Lambda function.
Right now there is no bot protection, no captcha or something like that. We can add Google re-captcha on the contact
form and setup rate limiting on both API Gateway and Lambda function, to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>

A cluster of the company's executives stood near Prince, ready to shout out a countdown. “Louder! Loud!” Prince urged them. “Five! Four! Three! …” At 9:30 am sharp, the founders reached down to ring the exchange's famous bell, kicking off the day's trading and offering their 10-year-old company on the public market. It was a rite of passage and also their payday, a moment that unlocked many millions of dollars in newfound wealth.</p><p>More than 100 employees and investors cheered from the trading floor below, their phones held high to capture the scene. Kristin Holloway, employee number 11, looked up at the balcony and snapped photos, then popped them into a text to her husband, Lee Holloway, the company's third cofounder. He was home in California. Every so often, a familiar face pushed through the throng to say to her, “Lee should be here.”</p><p>In Cloudflare's early years, Lee Holloway had been the resident genius, the guy who could focus for hours, code pouring from his fingertips while death metal blasted in his headphones. He was the master architect whose vision had guided what began as a literal sketch on a napkin into a tech giant with some 1,200 employees and 83,000 paying customers. He laid the groundwork for a system that now handles more than 10 percent of all internet requests and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cloudflare-matthew-prince-wired25/">blocks billions of cyberthreats</a> per day. Much of the architecture he dreamed up is still in place.</p><p>But some years before the IPO, his behavior began to change. He lost interest in his projects and coworkers. He stopped paying attention in meetings. His colleagues noticed he was growing increasingly rigid and belligerent, resisting others' ideas, and ignoring their feedback.</p><p>Lee's rudeness perplexed his old friends. He had built his life around Cloudflare, once vowing to not cut his hair until the startup's web traffic surpassed that of Yahoo. (It took a few short months, or about 4 inches of hair.) He had always been easygoing, happy to mentor his colleagues or hang out over lunch. At a birthday party for Zatlyn, he enchanted some children, regaling them with stories about the joys of coding. The idea of Lee picking fights simply didn't compute.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He was becoming erratic in other ways too. Some of his colleagues were surprised when Lee separated from his first wife and soon after paired up with a coworker. They figured his enormous success and wealth must have gone to his head. “All of us were just thinking he made a bunch of money, married his new girl,” Prince says. “He kind of reassessed his life and had just become a jerk.”</p><p>The people close to Lee felt tossed aside. They thought he'd chosen to shed his old life. In fact, it was anything but a choice. Over the next few years, Lee's personality would warp and twist even more, until he became almost unrecognizable to the people who knew him best. Rooting out the cause took years of detective work—and forced his family to confront the trickiest questions of selfhood.</p><p>On the floor of the stock exchange that September morning, Lee's younger brother Alaric weathered the morning in a state of low-grade panic. He snapped selfies with early employees and fired them off in texts to his brother. Alaric had never worked at Cloudflare, and he knew barely anyone there. But his dark hair flopped over his forehead with the same distinctive swoop as his brother's, and his long, tapering face had the same dark eyes and olive skin. “It was surreal,” Alaric says. “People kept looking at me like they knew me.”</p><p>At home with his parents in San Jose, Lee, 38, was restless. He paced the rooms and hallways of the 1,550-square-foot house, a loop he'd been tracing since he'd moved in with them two years earlier. He didn't speak. His parents had the TV on, and they called him over whenever Prince or Zatlyn appeared onscreen.</p><p>Later, he paused at the family's Roku to search YouTube for videos of Cloudflare. Then he resumed his circuit: walking the halls, buzzing his lips, snacking on cashews.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Lee Holloway spends time with his youngest son at home on California's Central Coast.</span><span>Artwork by Amy Friend; Photograph by Jack Bool</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>What makes you</span>  <em>you</em>? The question cuts to the core of who we are, the things that make us special in this universe. The converse of the question raises another kind of philosophical dilemma: If a person <em>isn't</em> himself, who is he?</p><p>Countless philosophers have taken a swing at this elusive piñata. In the 17th century, John Locke pinned selfhood <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/memory/">on memory</a>, using recollections as the thread connecting a person's past with their present. That holds some intuitive appeal: Memory, after all, is how most of us register our continued existence. But memory is unreliable. Writing in the 1970s, renowned philosopher Derek Parfit recast Locke's idea to argue that personhood emerges from a more complex view of psychological connectedness across time. He suggested that a host of mental phenomena—memories, intentions, beliefs, and so on—forge chains that bind us to our past selves. A person today has many of the same psychological states as that person a day ago. Yesterday's human enjoys similar overlap with an individual of two days prior. Each memory or belief is a chain that stretches back through time, holding a person together in the face of inevitable flux.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The gist, then, is that someone is “himself” because countless mental artifacts stay firm from one day to the next, anchoring that person's character over time. It's a less crisp definition than the old idea of a soul, offering no firm threshold where selfhood breaks down. It doesn't pinpoint, for example, how many psychological chains you can lose before you stop being yourself. <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/neuroscience/">Neuroscience</a> also offers only a partial answer to the question of what makes you <em>you</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/neural-networks/">Neural networks</a> encode our mental artifacts, which together form the foundation of behavior. A stimulus enters the brain, and electrochemical signals swoosh through your neurons, culminating in an action: Hug a friend. Sit and brood. Tilt your head up at the sun and smile. Losing some brain cells here or there is no big deal; the networks are resilient enough to keep a person's behaviors and sense of self consistent.</p><p>But not always. Mess with the biological Jell-O in just the right ways and the structure of the self reveals its fragility.</p><p>Lee's personality had been consistent for decades—until it wasn't.</p><p>From an early age, he was a person who could visualize sprawling structures in his mind. Growing up in the 1990s in Cupertino, where his dad worked at Apple, Lee had early access to the latest computers, and he and his brother grew up bingeing on videogames. As a gamer, he was legendary among his friends for being able to read a complex situation, rapidly adjust strategies, and win match after match. And it wasn't just videogames. His childhood friend Justin Powell remembers Lee strolling into a middle school chess club tournament cold. He wasn't a member of the club, but he won the tournament anyway. Lee avoided becoming insufferable by channeling his wit into snarky commentary. “Watching a movie with him was like a version of <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>,” Powell says. “His very presence challenged you to keep up with him.”</p><p>Lee and his friends would cart their computers to each other's houses to play games together. He became curious about the machines themselves and started learning computer science, first in high school, then at a local community college and UC Santa Cruz, where an unlikely set of circumstances connected him with Matthew Prince.</p><p>Then a young entrepreneur, Prince was pursuing an idea for an antispam software tool when he encountered Arthur Keller, a UC Santa Cruz computer science professor. Keller and his students had already worked out a very similar concept. Prince and Keller agreed to share a patent, along with Keller's students. One of those students was Lee, and Prince hired him on the spot. “I had no idea this school project would turn into something much bigger,” Lee later said in a video interview with a group called Founderly.</p><p>Prince set up the company, Unspam Technologies, in Park City, Utah, about a mile from a cluster of slopes where he could indulge his passion for skiing. Lee moved into Prince's basement, at first working for free in exchange for food and housing. But Lee and the other Unspam engineers grew restless, and they started spinning up side projects, including one called Project Honey Pot, which tracked spammers as they crawled the web. That's all it did—it collected and published data on spammers, but it didn't do anything to stop them. Still, the project quickly amassed a loyal following.</p><p>In 2007, Prince left Utah to start business school at Harvard, and Lee moved to California to live with his girlfriend, Alexandra Carey. They'd known each other as undergrads, when she was a teaching assistant in his computer architecture class. Lee had goofed off in that class, once pranking the professor by scrawling childish notes on the transparencies of an overhead projector. Alexandra had been amused, but it wasn't until after college that a relationship bloomed. Living in different cities, they fell for each other while playing and chatting within a multiplayer videogame called <em>Savage</em>. Now, with Prince leaving Utah, it seemed a natural time for Lee to join Alexandra. They married in 2008.</p><div><div><p><span><picture><img alt="This image may contain Electronics, Computer, and Pc" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 775w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 775w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_768%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 768w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_768%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 768w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 640w" sizes="100vw"></picture></span></p><div><h3><a href="https://weekly.statuscode.com/story/wired-guide-to-data-breaches">The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches</a></h3><p>Everything you ever wanted to know about Equifax, Mariott, and the problem with social security numbers.</p></div></div></div><p>Lee and Prince kept working at Unspam from their respective cities, but as Prince was wrapping up business school, Lee called to tell him he was considering other job offers.

            <h3>Reed-Solomon error recovery in RAID-6</h3>
        </p>

        <p>
            https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html
        </p>

        
        
        
        

        
        
        
        

        
        <p>There are lots of resources on the Internet about RAID-6 error recovery and how you can create your own implementation of it, but most of those resources require spending a lot of time fighting with mathematical equations and figuring out the real algorithm.</p>
<p>In this post I'll try to give you a simple example how you can create your own error recovery solution based on what is used in RAID-6. More specifically, if you need to provide rendundancy across your mediums so that a failure of 1 or 2 mediums will be tolerated, look no further! ;)</p>
<p>If you'll read this post, as a bonus you'll gain knowledge about how RAID-5 error recovery works, because RAID-6 is an improved version of RAID-5 error recovery system.</p>

<p>Let's assume you have 3 disk drives with some data. Let's name those drives as <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>. In order to use the same error recovery technique as RAID-6 uses, you'll need two additional disk drives, the <code>PD</code> drive, and the <code>RS</code> drive. I'll describe what <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> means in few moments. So, you'll need a total of 5 disk drives: <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code>, <code>D3</code>, <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, here's the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code> contain <em>arbitrary user data</em>, and it doesn't matter what their contents are. FWIW you can assume those drives are full of cat pictures.</li>
<li>The special <code>PD</code> drive (named after <code>Parity Drive</code>, sometimes called <code>P</code> in whitepapers) contains the XOR data, generated automatically from <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</li>
<li>The second special <code>RS</code> drive (named after <code>Reed-Solomon Drive</code>, sometimes also called <code>Q</code>) contains the Reed-Solomon codes, calculated from the same data as <code>PD</code>, namely from drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how we can perform some basic operations on such disk array.</p>

<p>If we have properly calculated <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> drives, we can lose up to 2 drives. How we recover from failures depends on which drives will fail. There are generally 7 cases that RAID-6 can handle. Next points will describe the scenarios, sorted from the easiest case, to the most complicated.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-losspd.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is very straightforward. The <code>PD</code> drive contains only autogenerated data, so in case we lose the <code>PD</code> drive, we can regenerate it by using only user data (stored on disks <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of one of the data drives: either <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> or <code>D3</code> (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-datadrive.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case we're losing data, but since we only lose 1 disk, the recovery scenario is the same as in RAID-5 error recovery: we'll use <code>PD</code> drive <em>together with two non-missing data drives</em> to recover data from the missing data drive. It doesn't matter which data drive we lose, because if we have 2 data drives and the <code>PD</code> drive, we can always generate data for the third drive. The <code>RS</code> drive is not needed to regenerate the data drive in this case (and is not used at all in this failure case).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>RS</code> drive (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossrs.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Similar to the situation from point 1: we have all the data drives, and we can simply regenerate the <code>RS</code> drive by calculating Reed-Solomon codes from drives that did not fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive and the <code>RS</code> drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-losspdrs.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is very similar to points 1 or 3, we have all the data intact, so we can generate contents of <code>PD</code> drive and then <code>RS</code> drive very easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>RS</code> drive and one data drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatars.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case we're losing two disks, but only one lost disk is filled with data. Since we have <code>PD</code> drive intact, we can use it to regenerate data from missing data drive, so this case is not so different than case #2. After that, we will have all the data drives, so we can regenerate the <code>RS</code> drive easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive and one data drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatapd.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is more complicated. We lose one user data drive (in this example <code>D3</code>), and we don't have the <code>PD</code> drive to aid with recovery, because we've lost it as well. We have to use the <code>RS</code> drive in conjunction with all user data drives that are still available (<code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code>) to regenerate the missing data drive <code>D3</code>. After we'll have all data drives regenerated, we can calculate the missing <code>PD</code> drive. This is the first case where recovery using Reed-Solomon codes comes into play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of two data drives (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatadata.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the most complicated scenario. We need to use both <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> to regenerate both data drives. Reed-Solomon coding makes this case possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following sections, I'll try to describe those cases above with more detail, and provide some source code (in Python :P) that will perform actual recovery of data.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that real RAID-6 arrays don't really dedicate whole disk for <code>PD</code> or <code>RS</code>. Real arrays span this additional checksum data across all disks. There are multiple methods used by various controllers: left asynchronous, right synchronous, there can be an offset to the RAID data, there can be pattern delays, etc. Why it's done this way, and how exactly RAID-6 stripes looks like is beyond the scope of this blog post. So let's stick only to Reed-Solomon codes.</p>
<h2 id="test-data">Test data</h2>
<p>Let's define how our "user data" looks like. To keep things simple, let's pretend that our "disk drives" are 5 bytes big.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Disk</th><th>Data in ASCII</th><th>Data in HEX</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>D1</code></td><td>f i r s t</td><td>0x66, 0x69, 0x72, 0x73, 0x74</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>D2</code></td><td>s e c n d</td><td>0x73, 0x65, 0x63, 0x6e, 0x64</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>D3</code></td><td>t h i r d</td><td>0x74, 0x68, 0x69, 0x72, 0x64</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Let's go into the scenarios mentioned above in more details.</p>

<p>In order to generate the <code>PD</code> data, we need only the user data drives. In our case it's <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>. The <code>PD</code> drive consists of nothing more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">XOR</a> of all user data.</p>
<ul>
<li>To generate offset 0 of the <code>PD</code> drive, you need to XOR all bytes from offset 0 from all disk drives.</li>
<li>Then, to generate offset 1 of the <code>PD</code> drive, you need to XOR bytes from offset 1 from all disk drives. E.g.:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>PD[0] = D1[0] xor D2[0] xor D3[0]
PD[1] = D1[1] xor D2[1] xor D3[1]
PD[2] = D1[2] xor D2[2] xor D3[2]
PD[3] = D1[3] xor D2[3] xor D3[3]
PD[4] = D1[4] xor D2[4] xor D3[4]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>PD[0] = 0x66 xor 0x73 xor 0x74  =&gt;  0x61
PD[1] = 0x69 xor 0x65 xor 0x63  =&gt;  0x64
PD[2] = 0x72 xor 0x63 xor 0x69  =&gt;  0x78
PD[3] = 0x73 xor 0x6e xor 0x72  =&gt;  0x6f
PD[4] = 0x74 xor 0x64 xor 0x64  =&gt;  0x74
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, it's that simple. Do it for the whole drives (in our case, 5 bytes), and you'll have the properly generated <code>PD</code> drive:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Disk</th><th>Data in HEX</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>PD</code></td><td>0x61, 0x64, 0x78, 0x6f, 0x74</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So, in case when only your <code>PD</code> drive will fail, you can see it's trivial to regenerate it from the data drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, this is how RAID-5 error recovery works. If only one drive with user data will fail, we can use the <code>PD</code> drive to recalculate missing user data.</p>
<p>Let's say we're losing <code>D2</code>, so the drives that are still working are: <code>D1</code>, <code>D3</code>, <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code>. In this case, we don't even look at <code>RS</code>. All we need are the <code>D1</code>, <code>D3</code> and <code>PD</code> drives. To calculate missing data, you can use the XOR function again, like in the previous point.</p>
<p>To recover user data from offset 0, XOR the bytes from offsets 0 of disks with user data you haven't lost (<code>D1</code> and <code>D3</code>) together with the byte from offset 0 from the <code>PD</code> drive. Do the same thing for offset 1, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>D2[0] = D1[0] xor D3[0] xor PD[0]
D2[1] = D1[1] xor D3[1] xor PD[1]
D2[2] = D1[2] xor D3[2] xor PD[2]
D2[3] = D1[3] xor D3[3] xor PD[3]
D2[4] = D1[4] xor D3[4] xor PD[4]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>D2[0] = 0x66 xor 0x74 xor 0x61  =&gt;  0x73 (s)
D2[1] = 0x69 xor 0x63 xor 0x64  =&gt;  0x65 (e)
D2[2] = 0x72 xor 0x69 xor 0x78  =&gt;  0x63 (c)
D2[3] = 0x73 xor 0x72 xor 0x6f  =&gt;  0x6e (n)
D2[4] = 0x74 xor 0x64 xor 0x74  =&gt;  0x64 (d)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can easily recover data from the missing drive. It doesn't matter which drive is missing; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">XOR function</a> will work anyway.</p>

<p>Now we enter the realm of the Reed-Solomon codes and Galois fields. But don't worry, you don't have to be a mathematician in order to <em>use</em> it.</p>
<p>When we lose only <code>RS</code> drive, or when we initialize a new RAID-6-like redundation system, we simply need to regenerate it. In order to do that, we need to use the <code>gflog</code> and <code>gfilog</code> tables, which are always constant, plus data from our existing data drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</p>
<p>This is the <code>gflog</code> table, it always stays the same:</p>
<pre><code><span>    0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x19, 0x02, 0x32, 0x1a, 0xc6, 0x03, 0xdf, 0x33, 0xee, 0x1b, 0x68, 0xc7, 0x4b,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post highlight my experiment of replacing OpenSSL cryptographic library
with its embedded competitor: <code>wolfssl</code>.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequites</strong></em>: <em>Basic knowledge about C/C++ programming</em>.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-background-about-openssl">A bit of background about OpenSSL</h2><p>OpenSSL is one of the most crucial libraries on a Unix system: it performs
cryptographic functions and it provides <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (<em>TLS</em>) and <em>Secure Sockets Layer</em> (<em>SSL</em>) protocols to applications.</p><p>According to the <em>Arch Linux</em> <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/openssl/">OpenSSL package</a>, <strong>355</strong> packages, out of the
<em>11523</em> available, depend on it. You can find it installed on any Unix system
(and on Windows too!).</p><p>It started in 1998 as a fork of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSLeay">SSLeay</a> and it has been in development since.
Two full-time developers work on it, as well as many volunteers.</p><p>Fast forward to 2014: a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a></em> had been issued regarding a high risk
vulnerability found in OpenSSL. It has been given the name <strong><a href="https://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a></strong>,
because it has been found in the <em>TLS</em>/<em>DTLS</em> heartbeat extension (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520">RFC6520</a>).
This vulnerability allowed attackers to steal sensitive data, such as secret
keys, user names and passwords.</p><p>All the community turned to the OpenSSL project, weighting its implementation
and security policy. Heartbleed have been promptly fixed, but there could be new
vulnerabilities in the future, if security was not properly prioritized during
development.</p><p>At this point, OpenBSD’s folks forked OpenSSL and started a new project:
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a>. It primary goals were to <strong>modernize the codebase and to improve
its security</strong>. This new project hasn’t been adopted by big distributions such
Ubuntu and Arch Linux; instead smaller distributions (at that time) replaced
OpenSSL with LibreSSL on their default configuration, such as Alpine and Void.</p><p>In the last years, LibreSSL have seen a decline in its usage. Alpine switched
back to OpenSSL (<a href="https://lists.alpinelinux.org/~alpine/devel/%3C20181011171746.4c01f758%40ncopa-desktop.copa.dup.pw%3E">link to the thread</a>). Many people and distributions are
considering doing the same, since OpenSSL got the improvement that LibreSSL
aimed for. And it’s still the <em>de facto standard</em> cryptographic library on Unix.</p><h2 id="why-replacing-openssl-now">Why replacing OpenSSL now?</h2><p>OpenSSL works fine, there is no denying that. Every software has <em>out of the box
support for it</em> so it costs no effort in term of additional mainteinance.
However, there are <strong>newer and lighter TLS and SSL implementations</strong>, which many
folks might prefer over the heavy OpenSSL’s one. I, too, prefer lightweight
libraries.</p><p>I am uninstalling LibreSSL on my systems, therefore this might be the perfect
time to experiment with something different. I have found an interesting (and
well done!) library called <em><strong><a href="https://wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a></strong></em> that claims to have an <em>OpenSSL
compatibility layer</em>. It also claims to be 20 times smaller than OpenSSL.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p><strong>wolfSSL</strong> is a small C library; It uses <em>autotools</em> to build and <strong>CMake</strong>
support is being added (sigh!). Upon running <code>configure</code>, I am overwhelmed by
the quantity of compile options available.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wolf-ssl-configure.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>some of the wolfSSL configure options</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, there is one comfy option which I’ve used
when compiling wolfSSL: <code>--enable-all</code>. It enables all options, including
the OpenSSL compatibility layer and leaves out the <em>SSL 3</em> protocol.</p><p>Upon completing the build and installation (which takes a couple of
minutes), a library <code>libwolfssl.so</code> will be installed into <code>/usr/lib</code>, as
well as a pkgconfig file (<code>wolfssl.pc</code>) and all the headers.</p><h2 id="out-of-the-box-support">Out of the box support</h2><p>Key applications provide support for different SSL implementations other than
OpenSSL. For example <em>curl</em> supports <em>mbedTLS</em>, <em>BearSSL</em> and our <strong>wolfSSL</strong>.
To compile <em>curl</em> using wolfSSL, we just need to add <code>--with-ssl=wolfssl</code> and
we’re done. I am aware of only two packages that have out of the box support
for wolfSSL and they are <em>curl</em> and <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2">wget2</a></em> (not the legacy version!).</p><h2 id="openssl-compatibility">OpenSSL compatibility</h2><p><code>--enable-all</code> configure option enabled the OpenSSL compatibility layer.
To use this layer, according to the <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch13/">documentation</a>, we need to link the wolfssl
library manually by adding <code>-lwolfssl</code> as link argument. We also need to
include the path <code>/usr/include/wolfssl</code> so that the OpenSSL headers in
<code>/usr/include/wolfssl/openssl</code> will be picked up.</p><p>This way both wolfSSL and OpenSSL can coexist on the same system and the latter
can be replaced on a per project basis. However, that’s not what we want since
want to replace OpenSSL at a system level.</p><p>Adding the link flag to each package on the system or patching one by one
is not an option as it would take too much time. Let’s instead apply some
workarounds.</p><p>First, we create a symlink for the headers:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/include/wolfssl/openssl /usr/include/openssl
</code></pre></div><p>Then we create a symlink for each library. OpenSSL provides the following
libraries:</p><ul><li><code>libssl.so</code></li><li><code>libcrypto.so</code></li></ul><p>So we can run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libwolfssl.so /usr/lib/libssl.so
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libwolfssl.so /usr/lib/libcrypto.so
</code></pre></div><h3 id="fixing-pkg-config">Fixing pkg-config</h3><p>Some software rely on pkg-config for checking OpenSSL dependency since
it provides the following pkg-config files:</p><ul><li><code>libssl.pc</code></li><li><code>libcrypto.pc</code></li><li><code>openssl.pc</code></li></ul><p>My system doesn’t currently have either OpenSSL or LibreSSL installed, so any
attempt to include OpenSSL by using pkg-config will fail. We can fix this by
adding a pkg-config file in <code>/usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc</code>:</p><pre><code>prefix=/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-musl
includedir=${prefix}/include/wolfssl

Name: openssl
Description: wolfssl C library.
Version: 4.6.0
Requires: wolfssl
Cflags: -I${includedir}
</code></pre><p>Our pkg-config file will include the correct directory containing the OpenSSL
headers. It will also import cflags and link flags from the wolfssl pkg-config.
Let’s try if it works as intended:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ pkg-config --cflags --libs openssl
-I/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/include/wolfssl -lwolfssl
</code></pre></div><p>Yes! Now we just need create symlinks the other two pkg-config files:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libssl.pc
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libcrypto.pc
</code></pre></div><p>Now we’re ready to compile system packages.</p><h2 id="compiling-system-packages">Compiling system packages</h2><p>Before actually going further into the various compile results, there are few
general changes that I’ve done:</p><ol><li>Include the default <code>/usr/include/wolfssl/option.h</code> provided in
<code>/usr/include/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/setting.h</code>. This way we will have a bunch of
defines already included that enable many wolfSSL features.</li><li>Remove some defines from <code>option.h</code> that disable old OpenSSL features, like
old SSL names. While I understand that these features are plainly old (or even
deprecated), projects will still use them as long as they haven’t been
removed upstream.</li><li>Define <code>OPENSSL_NO_WHIRPOOL</code> in the same header as above, since this feature
ins’t implemented in wolfSSL. There are other <code>OPENSSL_NO_*</code> defines there for
unimplemented features, but this one was missing.</li></ol><h3 id="wget">wget</h3><p><em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a></em>, which comes installed on any Unix system, is the first software we’ll
try building with wolfSSL and its OpenSSL compatibility layer.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wget-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>wget compile error</figcaption></figure><p>wget complains about two undeclared identifiers:</p><ul><li><code>CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION</code></li><li><code>CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE</code></li></ul><p>We can fix this by adding the defines from the OpenSSL file <code>openssl/conf.h</code>
to <code>/usr/include/wolfssl/option.h</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span># define CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE 0x10
</span><span># define CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION     0x20
</span></code></pre></div><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wget-error-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>wget link-time errors about missing symbols</figcaption></figure><p>We arrived at link-time, that’s huge! However, there are 8 undefined symbols:
6 symbols about unimplemented features in wolfSSL, such as <code>i2d_x509_PUBKEY</code>
and <code>a2i_IPADDRESS</code>; 2 symbols regarding wolfSSL functions. The latter could
probably be fixed by adding the proper compile time option to wolfSSL, like
<code>--enable-sslv3</code>.</p><h3 id="rhash">rhash</h3><p>rhash is an utility that calculates and verifies message digests, such as
<em>SHA256</em> and <em>MD5</em>. It is required by CMake, so we can consider it an essential
package. Compiling rhash led to many errors. Let’s look in depth at some of
them.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/rhash-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>rhash compile error about RIPEMD160_CTX</figcaption></figure><p><em>rhash</em> uses <code>RIPEMD160_CTX</code> which is not implemented by wolfSSL.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/rhash-error-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>rhash compile error about WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</figcaption></figure><p>This time, rhash access a member of <code>MD5_CTX</code> (which wolfSSL has replaced by
<code>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</code>) using <code>offsetof</code>. The original <code>MD5_CTX</code> struct looks like
this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MD5state_st</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>D</span><span>;</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>Nl</span><span>,</span> <span>Nh</span><span>;</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>MD5_LBLOCK</span><span>];</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>MD5_CTX</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</code> instead looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/* big enough to hold wolfcrypt md5, but check on init */</span>
<span>#ifdef STM32_HASH
</span><span></span>    <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>holder</span><span>[(</span><span>112</span> <span>+</span> <span>WC_ASYNC_DEV_SIZE</span> <span>+</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>STM32_HASH_Context</span><span>))</span> <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)];</span>
<span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>holder</span><span>[(</span><span>112</span> <span>+</span> <span>WC_ASYNC_DEV_SIZE</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)];</span>
<span>#endif
</span><span></span><span>}</span> <span>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I think that this incosistency between OpenSSL and wolfSSL structs <em>will</em>
happen again with different data types.</p><h3 id="libssh2">libssh2</h3><p>From the official <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/">libssh2</a> site:</p><blockquote><p><em>libssh2 a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol</em></p></blockquote><p>curl has a hard dependency on libssh2, so we can consider it another essential
package.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/libssh2-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>libssh2 build errors</figcaption></figure><p>This time there are only 2 errors, both about unimplemented features:
<code>EVP_bf_cbc</code> and <code>EVP_cast5_cbc</code>. The man pages are the best source of
information about OpenSSL functions; we can browse them by running:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ man EVP
$ man EVP_bf_cbc
$ man EVP_cast5_cbc
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s split the names and study each part:</p><ul><li><code>EVP</code> is a high-level interface to cryptographic functions</li><li><code>bf</code> and <code>cast5</code> are the name of the algorithms, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)">blowfish</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAST-128">CAST</a></em>
respectively.</li><li><code>cbc</code>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#:~:text=Cipher%20block%20chaining%20(CBC),-CBC&amp;text=In%20CBC%20mode%2C%20each%20block,used%20in%20the%20first%20block.">Cipher Block Chaining</a></em>, is a mode of operation that tells OpenSSL
to operate on each block seperately from the others.</li></ul><p>Operating cryptographic functions in <em>CBC</em> mode isn’t really safe nor the
two algorithms above are really popular, so I understand why wolfSSL developers
might have prioritized other things over implementing the two functions above.</p><h3 id="ffmpeg">ffmpeg</h3><p><em><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a></em> is a powerful library and a collection of utilities for handling
images, audio and videos. It is required by <em>Firefox</em>, <em>Chromium</em>, <em>mpv</em> and
another hundred and a half software (at least). We surely don’t want a system
without this library.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/ffmpeg-error.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>ffmpeg build error</figcaption></figure><p>This time there is only one error (but others may still pop up later while
building!). The function <code>BN_sub_word</code> is missing. According to the man pages,
it is the arithmetic function that perform subtractions on big integers.
This seems pretty straightforward …</p></div></div>

Then I find the point where it focuses. It’s pretty gorilla. Very, very gorilla, but it works.<img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_25.png" alt="" width="1072" height="599" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_25.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_25-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_25-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px"></p>
<p>So in this situation I don’t have a lens on the front of the camera. So if the camera is going to fire without a lens on it, you have to go to the menus and you’ve have to turn on the setting which will allow the camera to fire when there’s no lens attached. There’s no coupling here. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">This is just a space between the lens and the front of the camera. I did have to turn that feature on that will allow me to shoot without a lens in order to make this work.</p>

So I can get right here close and to the side and I’m in the shot. And I am in the shot when I move all the way around to the other side.</p>

It almost has a tilt shift kind of quality like it’s you’re focusing on one point. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31.png" alt="" width="1072" height="599" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px">When you get somebody up front like this, it gives you a blur all the way around. It’s very cool looking.</p>

<p>I’m learning as we go along here, it doesn’t have a flat plane of focus, but I think that’s because of the way I mounted the camera back there. It’s a little bit like a tilt shift. So I didn’t get them quite square, which is kind of cool because I get the face in focus, but the hands or the body go out of focus in the foreground. It’s just kind of cool looking.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39.png" alt="" width="1067" height="596" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39.png 1067w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1067px) 100vw, 1067px"></p>
<p>One of the reasons I love to carry a light in my bag is anytime I’m doing a street portrait or something, a continuous light is so easy to flip up really fast. It gives us a little bit of light on the face and opens up the shadows. The <a href="https://bhpho.to/32nCIvK">LitraStudio</a> is perfect for that because it’s easy. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40.png" alt="" width="1074" height="601" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40.png 1074w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1074px) 100vw, 1074px">Turn it on and it’s so powerful, it’s worth the weight. It’s not like one of the little tiny ones Litra makes. I like the bigger heavier light because it just gives me so much more power. Especially in a situation like this where you have the sun to deal with.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42.png" alt="" width="1072" height="601" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px"></p>
<p>So there you have it. I’m going to do more of this. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44.png" alt="" width="1072" height="602" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px">I want to adapt some other lenses to my EOS R and just try to get weird views and that kind of gritty look. This actually was way cleaner than I thought it was going to be. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">I don’t even have something blocking the light between the camera and the lens. I used just a little bit of tape in here. But it projects a great image on the sensor. It’s a little hard to focus but a lot of fun to shoot. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">So I hope you enjoyed this.

<p>Today’s screen readers traverse web pages and applications and read out user interface elements, content and allow users to navigate and interact with the web.</p>
<p>There are many screen readers available for different devices and platforms, each with differing levels of functionality, interfaces and features. The most common are JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver and TalkBack.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/">WebAIM Screen Reader User Survey</a>, when it comes to desktop screen reader usage, JAWS and NVDA are practically equal in usage, with around 40% of respondents reporting that they use one or the other.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jaketracey.com/webaim-graph.png" alt="Line chart of primary screen reader usage since October 2009. JAWS has steady decline from 68% to 40%. NVDA has steady incline from 3% to 41%. VoiceOver has a slow incline from 10% to 13%.">
<figcaption>Source: WebAIM</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Based on the graph above, there’s a clear pattern over the course of the last 10 years, with NVDA usage increasing as JAWS usage drops, culminating in an inflection point in 2019 when NVDA surpassed JAWS usage for the first time.</p>
<p>As a developer regularly faced with time constraints, I have often wondered: what should be the baseline in terms of testing for screen readers, and what browser and screen reader combinations are the most important to cover in order to achieve the greatest level of WCAG compliance?</p>
<h2>An issue of time</h2>
<p>Given that almost all web applications developed in 2021 are also used on mobile and therefore require testing on both iOS and Android devices, as well as Windows and macOS for desktop users, providing adequate support for such a broad range of scenarios becomes quite difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Let’s say in a best-case scenario, a given page or feature will be tested on the following combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS / VoiceOver</li>
<li>Android / TalkBack</li>

</ul>
<p>I should clarify that by “best-case”, I am conveniently leaving out any versions of Internet Explorer, but as frustrating as it may be, including it would add at least another 2 rounds of testing.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that WebAIM also recommends using Microsoft Edge with Narrator, but given its low usage, we’ll leave it out (more on this later).</p>
<p>Hypothetically, depending on the size of the functionality or page implemented, let’s say each round of testing takes one hour to complete, assuming the developer has experience with each of these browsers and screen readers.</p>
<p>In this scenario, comprehensively testing screen reader support across all these combinations adds 11 hours of development work – and that’s just to test!</p>
<h2>An issue of fragmentation</h2>
<p>Web developers will be familiar with the issues surrounding browser version fragmentation, and this problem is compounded when testing with screen readers. Contending with not only varying levels of HTML, Javascript and CSS support in the browser can be tough, and to combat this, polyfills and tools like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> have made life a lot easier.</p>
<p>When it comes to screen reader version fragmentation, there is very little in the way of either documentation or support for developers. Fixing issues often comes down to a case of trial and error, retesting and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>A piece of information that would be incredibly useful in this area would be <em>penetration of screen reader updates</em> from the vendors. If, for instance, developers knew that there was a high adoption rate of updates among screen reader users, they could be confident that if a screen reader update resolved an issue, patches for older versions could be sunsetted. This approach has worked exceptionally well for browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>Sadly, there’s not currently any way for a developer to identify the type or version of a screen reader that is being used, so implementing targeted fixes isn’t an option anyway right now.</p>
<h2>A case for dedicated accessibility testers</h2>
<p>Given the scope and time it takes to properly test across so many devices, browsers and screen readers, having dedicated accessibility testers embedded into teams can significantly increase the quality and speed with which properly accessible applications can be produced.</p>
<p>Let’s face it: developers already have a hard time keeping up with the pace of change in their own domain, let alone the level of knowledge required for comprehensive accessibility auditing.</p>
<p>That is not to say that developers should ignore accessibility completely. However, expecting someone to know about a specific bug on a particular combination of code, browser and screen reader is too much, even for the most experienced accessibility-focused developer.</p>
<h2>Why automation isn’t enough</h2>
<p>The old saying "a good programmer is a lazy programmer" comes to mind when I think about testing here. Being lazy myself (although possibly not that great of a programmer), I rely on automated tools like <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">axe</a> to do most of my accessibility for me. While the current range of tooling is excellent, and picks up the most obvious issues, when it comes to screen readers there’s no way around it: you need to manually test.</p>
<p>Why? Well, the current state of both browsers and screen reader support is all over the place. To highlight this, the Powermapper website has a neat <a href="https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/aria/">list of screen reader support for WAI-ARIA attributes</a>. Not throwing shade at any one – things are continuously improving with updates to browsers and screen readers – but the point stands. Current automated testing tools are not going to catch these problems because they essentially test the validity of code, in much the same way as a code linter does.</p>
<h2>A compromise, so we can all still get stuff done</h2>
<p>Not every team has the luxury of a dedicated accessibility tester, or even a dedicated tester for that matter. Sometimes, you just need to do the best you can, with the resources that you have available.</p>
<p>"When can we stop supporting this?" has been the desperate cry of developers for years when it comes to Internet Explorer 9/10 and most recently 11, and as their usage has dropped, so has the rate of developers losing their hair trying to get their code working.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Microsoft Edge with Narrator, as mentioned earlier. With 1% of users in that survey, and possibly 0% of users for your application or site, is it worth testing on this combination at all? More specifically, what number of users justifies support, and the testing and development overhead that comes with it?</p>
<h3>Windows - Chrome (latest version), NVDA</h3>
<p>As of December 2020, Chrome is by far the most popular browser in the world, with 65.3% of users. Later versions of Microsoft Edge utilize the same rendering engine, so there is a high likelihood that if it works in Chrome, it will work similarly in Edge.</p>
<p>Based on the WebAIM stats, it is a safe bet that NVDA will begin to increase its lead over JAWS over the next few years. Given that it is also open-source and free, I can’t help but draw a comparison to the way Firefox overtook Internet Explorer in the 2000s browser wars.</p>
<h3>macOS - Safari (latest version), VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Safari is a fair distance behind Chrome in terms of users, with 16.7% share as of writing, but it has the benefit of being the default browser in macOS. It is also free, and the support for accessibility features with VoiceOver is second to none. In addition to this, because of the similarity with its mobile counterpart, most likely any issues that are identified in the desktop version will have similar fixes.</p>
<h3>iOS - Safari (latest version), VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Safari is by far the most popular browser on iOS and all other browsers on iOS use the WebKit rendering engine. VoiceOver is the gold standard for mobile screen readers (and the only option for iOS devices), and as such it makes sense to use this combination for testing iOS accessibility.</p>
<h3>Android - Chrome (latest version), TalkBack</h3>
<p>In a similar vein to iOS, being the default browser and screen reader combination for Android makes this a simple choice, as it will cover the vast majority of users on this platform. Although manufacturers do include their own browsers and there are quite a few other options on Android, the vast majority of the time they use the inbuilt rendering engine, so the expectation in terms of accessibility should be similar, if not identical, to the Chrome experience.</p>
<p>This is by no means a catch-all solution for everyone. Each circumstance will be different, and the best course of action would be to engage your users and ask rather than trying to make the decision for them.</p>
<p>The reality is that if your site or application’s design or functionality looks bad or works poorly for a large enough number of your users because it does not support the software that they use, it can have potential ramifications to your business, through sales or reputation. Similarly, poor accessibility will have a negative impact if your users are using older versions of screen readers and browser combinations.</p>
<h2>But what about JAWS, ZoomText, System Access, <em>insert screen reader here</em>?</h2>
<p>At the risk of being slightly incendiary, I dislike the idea of paying for something that I can get for free. NVDA is a project that has brought screen readers to everybody – including those without the financial means to pay for it – so I support it. Along with the clear trajectory of its usage uptake, it is not unreasonable to expect that the majority of users will adopt it in the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, your best bet when it comes to identifying where your testing efforts should be placed is to talk to your users to find out what their needs are and what software they use. If you don’t have access to this information, the proposed testing scope above will suffice for the vast majority of your site or application’s users, and most likely will continue to do so in the years to come.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<b>Generational references</b> are a new memory management technique that's easy, deterministic, and <i>very</i> fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
This technique is the first ingredient in Vale's final <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory">hybrid-generational memory</a> design, which is even faster. Our eventual goal is to be as fast as Rust, and perhaps even as fast as C++, while being safer than both. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a>
</p>
<p>
This article explains how generational references work, how they compare to reference counting, and what makes it all so fast. <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it.
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want. <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>
</p>
<p>
In other languages, when a programmer frees an object and then accidentally dereferences a non-owning reference to it, it can cause memory unsafety and vulnerabilities. <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to detect this situation and react to it safely. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a><a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

 Generational Reference: More than just a pointer!</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A pointer to the object.
</li>
<li>
A "target generation" integer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.
</p>

<h3 id="dereferencing">
 Dereferencing</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To dereference a generational reference, we do a "liveness check" to see whether the allocation's generation number <b>still matches</b> our reference's target generation. <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a>
</p>
<p>
This prevents use-after-free problems, and makes Vale completely memory safe.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It's as if the reference is saying:
</p>
<p><b>"Hello! I'm looking for the 11th inhabitant of this house, are they still around?"</b>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
and the person who opens the door says:
</p>
<p><b>"No, sorry, I'm the 12th inhabitant of this house, the 11th inhabitant is no more."</b> <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><b>"Yes! That is me. Which of my fields would you like to access?"</b>

Generational references are only the first steps towards hybrid-generational memory, but we decided to run some early experiments to see how it compares to existing memory models.
</p>
<p>
For this experiment, we benchmarked <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a> three flavors of Vale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unsafe</b>, with no memory safety, the equivalent of C++ (minus caveats, see below!)
</li>
<li>
<b>RC</b>, where we use naive reference counting for all our objects.
</li>
<li>
<b>GM</b>, which uses generational references.
</li>
</ul>

 Here, we benchmarked against other flavors of Vale, to isolate the differences between unsafe, reference-counting, and generational references.
</p>
<p>
Once we implement full hybrid-generational memory, we'll be benchmarking against C++ and Rust, stay tuned!

Generational references have only 10.84% overhead, <b>less than half the cost of reference counting!</b> These are very promising results, and suggest that full hybrid-generational memory could be incredibly fast.

Try it out! In the Vale release, you can find a benchmark folder with scripts to run the benchmarks. You can find the source code for the various approaches <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/tree/master/Midas/src/c-compiler/region">here</a> (feel free to swing by the <a href="https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH">discord server</a> and we can point you to the right files).

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a> for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

 Why is this so fast?</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.
</li>
<li>
Liveness checks' branching is easier to predict than RC decrements' branching.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
We explain these two differences more below.

<h3 id="no-aliasing-costs">
 No Aliasing Costs</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For example:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>launchShip</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>, <span><span><span>armada</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>List</span>&lt;<span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>)</span> <span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<br>    <p>  <span><span>armada</span><span>.</span><span>add</span>(<span>ship</span>)</span>;</p><p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  
<p>
As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.
</p>

</section>

      </div>
  


    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
  
<section>
<p>
Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

</section>

      </div>
  
<div>

      <div>
        <div>
    
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
 Half of these are aliasings and half are dealiasings. Aliasing happens whenever we access a member (e.g. <span>person.name</span>) or make a new reference (e.g. <span>&amp;person</span>).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note12" data-noteid="12">
<p><span>12</span></p><section>
<p>
 Many languages are able to skip a lot of the adjustments, using static analysis. For example, Lobster can remove up to 95%. Our experiment doesn't have those optimizations; it compares naive RC to naive generational references.

January 6, 2021 | https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/founder-guide-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/founder-guide-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><p>We’ve learned a lot at Aesthetic about how early stage companies can best leverage design to become more valuable. We’re excited to share our learnings from working with 100+ companies over the last 18 months. We hope this will be helpful to the entire startup community, especially founders that are just getting started on their journey and are new to design.</p><p>Design is a highly diverse discipline, with dozens of different fields and specialties. Similar to software product development, the scope and scale of design teams is highly variant and meant to reflect the needs of their organization. For early stage startups — those that are pre product-market fit, or have early market traction — the design needs tend to follow a similar pattern, and then tends to vary based on the specific business model of strong product market fit companies.</p><h2>The 3 most important types of design for early-stage companies</h2><p>At the highest level, founders of early stage companies should focus on:</p><ol><li>Product design</li><li>Web design</li><li>Brand design</li></ol><p>Here’s a breakdown of what each of these types of design means:</p><ul><li><strong>Product design is the user experience for your service or product.</strong> This doesn’t just include software that you build yourself, but also includes every other touchpoint you have with your customers or prospects. Product design isn’t just about creating user interfaces, but also developing wireframes, user research, and user experience testing.</li><li><strong>Web design is a company’s front door to the world.</strong> In 2020, your website is the most basic currency of reputation for every company, and needs to make it clear what you do and what people should care. For most companies, a website is step 0 for starting to get customers.</li><li><strong>Brand design is the why behind your company’s what.</strong> It’s how you explain who you are to people, by codifying the way you represent yourself across every surface. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand">Paul Rand</a> says, it’s “what people say about you when you’re not in the room.” This isn’t just your logo, fonts, colors, aesthetic and tone, but also the slide decks, emails, ads, and one pagers that you put out into the world.</li></ul><h2>What kind of design should my early-stage company focus on?</h2><p>How much effort should companies apply to each of these three types of design? It of course depends, but there are some easy rules-of-thumb you can follow:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-product-market fit companies should focus almost entirely on product design</strong> — with less effort on web design and brand design. This means spending as much time as you possibly can working on your product, and then bookmarking a few hours each week to make copy edits to your website. Don’t focus too much on the visuals at this stage, but rather your messaging and information architecture.</li><li><strong>Early-market-traction companies should maintain focus on product design, but start to ramp up web and brand design.</strong> These companies should do spike projects to develop more website content and begin developing their first marketing channel(s) and content roadmap(s) to activate their audience.</li><li><strong>Strong-product-market-fit companies should focus across the board.</strong> Spend time clarifying your brand identity, and take the time to review your entire user experience. Then, up the ante on production across all channels by turning brand design into a service center that can be consumed by your cross-functional orgs (ie, marketing and sales).</li></ul><p>It depends on the current phase your company is in:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-product-market fit companies should focus on talking to customers.</strong> You should be spending most of your time talking to users to understand their problems. All of the tools listed above are approachable, even if you’ve never “done design” before. You can read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515">Don’t Make Me Think</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/B07L5Y9HND/ref=sr_1_1?crid=260ZQHLO710HE&amp;keywords=design+of+everyday+things&amp;qid=1578340207&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=design+of+%2Cstripbooks%2C270&amp;sr=1-1">Design of Everyday Things</a>, <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research">Just Enough Research</a> and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9urYWGx2uNk">Gary Tan’s YouTube lectures</a> as good primers on the subject if you’re interested.</li><li><strong>Early-market-traction companies should consider hiring contractors to help with web and brand design.</strong> At this stage, it’d be hard to justify staffing for product design unless the founding team still maintained all user research, and just needed support with UI/UX. It might also make sense to staff web design if you have proof it’s a really useful channel for you today.</li><li><strong>Strong-product-market-fit companies should start hiring staff designers.</strong> Think of the trade-offs for hiring full-time versus working with outside support. Think of how you’d invest into these three areas of design, and what the top goals would be from anyone you worked with to get help. Then, start staffing by hiring full-time design, freelancers, and/or working with an agency.</li></ul><p>If you’re new to design, here are a few concrete actions and tools we recommend:</p><ul><li><strong>User research:</strong> The Aesthetic team recommends scheduling 2–3 user research interviews each week, ideally at the end of the week so you can also do usability testing on new features from the week.</li><li><strong>Take notes and record sessions:</strong> Make sure the entire team’s in each interview and take notes, record the sessions and do an affinity mapping exercise to formalize your learnings. We recommend <a href="https://fullstory.com/">Fullstory</a> for recording app and website user sessions.</li><li><strong>Design your website:</strong> Aesthetic loves <a href="http://webflow.com/">Webflow</a> for this phase, not just because they’ve built an awesome product and great people, but also because they’re YC alum and former batchmates :)</li><li><strong>Iterate on your brand design:</strong> Aesthetic uses <a href="http://figma.com/">Figma</a> for all of our marketing template designs, and the Adobe suite for developing our (vector based) brand identities. Depending on the specific tech stack, there’s a wide variety of solutions for helping deploy design systems to enable reusability and consistency across your product teams. Figma’s collaboration and animation support is second to none.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>One of the best window managers out there, i3 is a <strong>tiling window manager</strong> designed for <strong>X11</strong>. A <strong>window manager</strong> is a part of the desktop environment that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface (<strong>GUI</strong>). A desktop environment consists of even more components like compositors, file managers, display servers, etc. along with a windows manager which together gives the looks and feels of the GUI. Using a windows manager can be really helpful if you don’t need all those fancy tweakings and just want to use a lightweight and highly customizable GUI. 
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LZGBJ.png" alt="Desktop envornemnt"></p>

<p>i3 is a <strong>tiling</strong> windows manager which stacks your windows in proper stacks and tiles to efficiently use all the space. According to its official website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The usual elitism amongst minimal window managers: Don’t be bloated, don’t be fancy (simple borders are the most decoration we want to have). 
However, we do not enforce unnecessary limits such as a maximum amount of source lines of code. If it needs to be a bit bigger, it will be.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Easy configuration using a plain text file which can be executed during runtime with restarting the services.</li>
  <li>Well-maintained documentations (one of the best I’ve seen for any windows manager).</li>
  <li>Uses a tree as the abstraction (and underlying data structure) for window management.</li>
  <li>Implements different modes, similar to the text editor vi and vim. That is, keys have different functions depending on the mode that the window manager is in.</li>
  <li>Uses asynchronous <strong>XCB</strong> library instead of the old, synchronous <strong>XLIB</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>i3 is available for the following operating systems/distributions:</p>

<p><img src="https://sachinkumarsingh092.github.io/assets/i3wm.png" alt="Available systems" title="Available systems"></p>

<p>You can also download the official tarball from their <a href="https://i3wm.org/downloads/">downlaoad page</a>.</p>

<p>To run it, simply add the following line in  <code>~/.xsession</code> or <code>~/.xinitrc</code>:</p>


<p>Logout and then during logging in, click on the gear icon on your display manager (GDM if you’re using GNOME) and select <code>i3</code>.</p>

<p>On your first login, you are presented with the i3 configuration screen. Press ENTER to generate a config file in your <code>~/.config/i3</code> directory. Later you can use this config file to further customize i3’s behavior. On the next screen, you need to select your <strong>Mod</strong> key. This is important, as the <strong>Mod</strong> key is used to trigger most of i3’s keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>To open up a terminal, press <code>Mod + ENTER</code>.
The default keybindings are illustrated <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_default_keybindings">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Video Resource</strong></p>

<p>A three-part series of screencasts created by Alex Booker illustrating what i3 is, how to use it, how to configure it, and how to customize its appearance can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4&amp;list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h2>

<h5 id="operation-modes">Operation modes</h5>

<p>Traversing through these windows is just like tree traversal. Now you have different modes of operation, and each mode tweaks the layout, but all in all, it is just a tree data structure underneath. For example, when you start i3 with a single monitor, a single workspace and you open two terminal windows, you will end up with a tree-like this: 
<img src="https://i3wm.org/docs/tree-layout2.png" alt="two terminals on a workspace"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Splitv Mode</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This mode is used for opening windows that are vertically split. To activate this mode, simple press <code>Mod + v</code>. 
<img src="https://sachinkumarsingh092.github.io/assets/splitv.png" alt="Splitv" title="Splitv"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Splith Mode</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This mode is used for opening windows that are horizontally split. To activate this mode, simple press <code>Mod + h</code>.
<img src="https://sachinkumarsingh092.github.io/assets/splith.png" alt="Splith" title="Splith"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stack Mode</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Stack mode will place every tab on top of each other like a stack. To activate stack mode press <code>Mod + s</code>.
<img src="https://sachinkumarsingh092.github.io/assets/stack-mode.png" alt="Stack Mode" title="Stack Mode"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tabbed Mode</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The tabbed mode is exactly like the stack mode, the only difference being that it visually places the windows as tabs (the kind you might see on a browser). To activate it, press <code>Mod + w</code>.
<img src="https://sachinkumarsingh092.github.io/assets/tabbed-mode.png" alt="Tabbed mode" title="Tabbed mode"></p>

<h5 id="i3-bar">i3 bar</h5>

<p>The bar at the bottom of your monitor is drawn by a separate process called i3bar. By default, it is placed at the bottom but, of course, can be modified to be at the top with a lot of other customizations.</p>

<h5 id="workspaces">Workspaces</h5>

<p>Workspaces are shown in the bar and are numbered from 1-9 by default. You can change the name of the workspaces and a lot of other customizations according to your specific needs. To change to a different workspace press <code>Mod</code> + <em>workspace-number</em>.</p>

<h2 id="configurations">Configurations</h2>
<p>The i3 configuration lies in <code>~/.config/i3/config</code> file. It uses an easy to use the syntax for defining parameters, all of which are properly explained in details in the <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html">official documentation</a>. After making any changes, press <code>Mod + Shift + r</code> for the change to take effect and you’re good to go.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mod keys</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can change the default <code>Mod</code> key to be either <code>Alt</code> (<strong>Mod1</strong>) or <code>Windows</code> (<strong>Mod4</strong>) in the config file.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Keybindings</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>i3 allows you to bind commands either on keycodes or key symbols (keysym). The syntax to set keybindings and keysyms are:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bindsym [--release] [&lt;Group&gt;+][&lt;Modifiers&gt;+]&lt;keysym&gt; command
bindcode [--release] [&lt;Group&gt;+][&lt;Modifiers&gt;+]&lt;keycode&gt; command
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Restart
bindsym $mod+Shift+r restart

# Notebook-specific hotkeys
bindcode 420 exec --no-startup-id /home/sachin/bind.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more details visit <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>i3 bar</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Configuring your workspace bar starts with opening a <code>bar</code> block. You can have multiple bar blocks to use different settings for different outputs. The default bar block is shown below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bar {
    status_command i3status
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve customize my bar like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bar {
    status_command i3status
    font pango:monospace 10
    mode dock
    position top
    tray_output eDP1
    workspace_buttons yes
    strip_workspace_numbers yes
    colors {
      background #000000
      statusline #FFFFFF
      # &lt;colorclass&gt;     &lt;border&gt;  &lt;bg&gt;  &lt;text&gt;
      focused_workspace  #ffffff #ffffff #E57910
      active_workspace   #000000 #ffffff #000000
      inactive_workspace #000000 #ffffff #000000
      urgent_workspace   #900000 #900000 #ffffff
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For further details for each bar components, go <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_configuring_i3bar">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>dmenu</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the handy <code>dmenu</code> which is opened by pressing <code>Mod + d</code> by default. Just type the name (or a part of it) of the application which you want to open. The corresponding application has to be in your <code>$PATH</code> for this to work.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>TouchPad</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Using <strong>libinput</strong> we can configure settings for our touchpads. It’s not i3 specific, but I struggled with it a bit, so I think it’s worth mentioning it here.</p>

<p>Add the following in <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-touchpad.conf</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    Driver "libinput"
    Option "Tapping" "on"
    Option "TappingButtonMap" "lrm"
    Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"
    Option "ScrollMethod" "twofinger"
EndSection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More options <a href="https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/libinput.4">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>xinput</code> for particular touchpad tweaks. Just add the <code>xinput</code> option in the following form in  the configutration file:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>exec xinput set-prop &lt;device-name&gt; &lt;propery-name&gt; &lt;values&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="third-party-customisations">Third-Party Customisations</h2>
<p>There are many other available tools that are not part of the official i3-wm but can really add to the aesthetics of your GUI when using a windows manager.</p>

<h5 id="polybar">Polybar</h5>

<p>Polybar helps you to build beautiful status bars apart from the default i3-bar (which you can disable). There’s a bit of learning involved to get the syntax to create your own polybar but it’s worth learning if you want full control over the bar customization. You can learn all about it <a href="https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki">here</a>.</p>

<h5 id="picom">Picom</h5>

<p>Picom is a standalone compositor for Xorg. A compositor is a software that provides transition animation, transparency, and shadow and 3D effects to the windows. Picom is a fork of compton, which is a fork of xcompmgr-dana, which in turn is a fork of xcompmgr (how neat!).</p>

<p>You can learn all about it on the <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom">project’s repository</a>.</p>

<p>After making changes in your picom configuration file (<code>~/.config/picom/picom.conf</code>), add the following line in your i3 customization file:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>exec_always --no-startup-id picom --config ~/.config/picom/picom.conf 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="wallpapers">Wallpapers</h5>

<p>You can use <code>feh</code> to set the wallpapers. Add the following line in your customization file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>exec_always feh --bg-scale /path/to/image
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>i3 is free of bloat, is very easy to learn, and a very light-weight alternative to the conventional desktop environments. Its excellent documentation which encourages collaboration along with a great community makes it one of the best windows managers out there. There are still many more like dwm, Awesome, Bspwm, etc. each of which have their own flairs. But for now, I’m gonna stick with i3.</p>

<p>Not convinced yet? Check out the beautiful customizations by wm users on this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">subreddit</a>.</p>

	<p>Published 2020-09-02</p>
	

	
<p>There's a classic old idiom, "don't put your eggs all in one basket". The reasoning goes, what if the basket breaks? What if the basket isn't big enough, or gets stolen, or was cursed by a witch or something? It's important to have redundancy, to spread the eggs across many basket so that there's no one single point of failure.</p>
<p>But if we look at society, if we look at the internet, if we look at the communities we've built ourselves around... unfortunately, I believe that's exactly what a lot of us are doing. Being able to be yourself, being able to choose how you present yourself to the world, being able to tailor your living environment to your needs and desires? That's all very, very important. But if you give the keys to your self-expression and the options for the communities you belong in to one small, largely unknown group of people, that's not good.</p>
<p>In this ludicrously in-depth article, we'll be discussing how society limits both individual and community self-expression both online and offline.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The Third Place</h2>
<p><img alt="A house, labeled '1', an office complex, labeled '2', and a '3' with a question mark" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thirdplace.png"></p>
<p>Very, very broadly speaking, a working-class person (that is, not an "owner" like a CEO, landlord, or investment banker) lives their life in three kinds of places. The first place is home. It's where you sleep, it's where you do your hobbies, it's where you have privacy and family and possibly friends if you want to invite them over. The second place is work, where you do a job to contribute to society and receive wages.</p>
<p>But clearly, we do more than that. We go to other places. Grocery stores and shops, of course, but besides that. The "third place" is where you spend your time in public, in your community. American urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who came up with the concept of "the third place" in his 1989 book "The Great Good Place", defines the third place as (commonly seen as) eight characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no obligation to be here for legal, survival, political, etc. reasons. You can just <em>not show up</em>.</li>
<li>Everyone is equal. The rich, the poor, the minorities and the majorities all intermingle together in one common space.</li>
<li>Conversation and socializing is the main activity. You go here to "hang out".</li>
<li>They're accessible and accommodating for anyone who wants to visit.</li>
<li>It's a place where people regularly go, and whose regulars give the space its vibe and characteristics.</li>
<li>The physical place is not overly pretentious or imposed. It feels like <em>the community</em>, like an extension of home.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, the vibe here is more calm and friendly and playful than actively hostile and argumentative.</li>
<li>You feel like you have genuine ownership in the place, as if it's almost a communal home for you and the people you care about.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a relatively high bar, when spelled out like that. In pandemic-era America you'd be very hard pressed to name a place like this. Offline, anyways. But this sort of pattern has shown up a lot in history, because as it turns out people <em>like</em> having a communal space to just vibe in.</p>
<h3>The Town Square</h3>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo.jpg"></p>
<p>The most obvious example in urban environments is the town square or the plaza. It's an open area in the middle of town, usually with benches and close access to shops and homes and such. Pictured is <em>La Plaza del Zócalo</em>, the main square of Mexico City. It's been a meeting spot for the people of the area since the Aztec times, an important location for numerous historical events, and significant enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page. That's really amazing for a 240 m^2 slab of concrete. What's even more amazing is that it <em>wasn't</em> always a slab of concrete. Here's a model of how it looked in 1910.</p>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo1910.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a big park area! With a bunch of trees and benches and everything. Unfortunately, the very shaky politics of 20th century Mexico left the area in major disrepair by the 1970s, and it became that. I am not from Mexico, nor do I know anyone from the region, so I can't comment on what that did to the community in Mexico City. But as an outsider, I'd consider the 1910 Zócalo much more friendly and inviting than the modern one, which is literally a flat surface with a flagpole in the middle all surrounded by a busy road.</p>
<p>Obviously that isn't the only example. These tend to be a staple of small European and Hispanic towns. Just, a place, in your neighborhood, to go and chill. Other famous examples include the Roman Forum, the Greek Agoras, the National Mall of Washington D.C, and the "quads" or "diags" of most college campuses.</p>
<h3>Shopping Malls</h3>
<p>It is incredibly worth pointing out that town squares only make sense in urban contexts, where there's a dense population of people who live, work, and shop in one general area. The appeal of town squares is that they're basically on the way to wherever you're going, so it's a really nice spot to meet up with friends or just go if you're bored.</p>
<p>Suburbia is <em>not</em> that. Or, more accurately, it is that, <em>at the scale of the car.</em> See, America's fascination of suburban sprawl has a long detailed history to it. Paraphrasing from (imo) a very good book, "Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited" by Douglas S. Kelbaugh, the blame of sprawl can be pinned down largely on cultural reasons. First off, Americans always solved their resource and land division issues by expansion, growth, "moving out west". It was the safety valve to avoid actually thinking about difficult problems. At the time this was seen as the country's "manifest destiny", which eventually led to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQBTPY7gk">unnervingly cheery songs on children's television happily glossing over the genocide of Native Americans like it was no big deal</a>. And, heck, if we got all this elbow room, why not make everything really, really big? Big houses, big rooms, big parcels of land. And really, really cheap too, because of the glutton of natural resources. And sure, that'll get old and worn sometime, but some of the population will leave for greener pastures anyways, so there's no need to change anything.</p>
<p>So, around the early-to-mid 20th century, when cities were getting too full of colored people who were just demanding rights too loudly, most of the rich white people just up and left. They settled suburban areas outside the cities, less densely populated, with all the backyard space you need to cook out with your neighbors. And via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>, it was possible to dig very deeply a concrete "us vs. them" line in the dirt. The newfangled highway system just made it easier to separate the houses from the factories, to drive a wedge in the population. Also, just to drive the point home, federal, state, and local governments have subsidized services like sewer pipe connections, energy, and road building, often funded by taxes generated from the more urban, more productive areas.</p>
<p>An incredibly good example of this is to compare Flint and Burton, MI to the surrounding cities of Grand Blanc, Flushing, and Davison. I could spend a lot of time on this but I'd rather just do a visual comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/grandblanc.jpg">
<img alt="Section of the Flint River of Flint, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/flintriver.jpg"></p>
<p>It should be laughably easy to tell which one is which. (The first pic is the Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, which was the first image Google gave me. The second pic is a section of the Flint River between downtown Flint and Kettering University. I took that pic during an urbex tour a few years back, because Flint was somewhat nearby and makes for <em>amazing</em> urbex pics.)</p>
<p>Where this starts to cause issues is that instead of having one core neighborhood with residential, commercial, <em>and</em> industrial areas (in a SimCity-esque model), we've split those sections into their own, largely independent areas, often harshly split on racial or class boundaries. We've got gigantic swaths of houses with maybe a corner store and a gas station, we've got giant industrial parks or office complexes, and we've got the commercial districts.</p>
<p>It's the commercial districts I really want to highlight here. If the residential areas are home, and the industrial/office parks are work, then clearly the third place is the commercial district. Now, there's two ways to approach that. </p>
<p><img alt="A strip mall" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/stripmall.jpg"></p>
<p>The most common approach is to just put a bunch of boxes next to each other, surround it with a parking lot, and call it "a strip mall". Occasionally there will also be a "big box" store, like a Wal-Mart or a Target or a Best Buy or a Kohl's or a Home Depot, either attached or detached.</p>
<p>In the very worst scenarios, you're subject to drive through the <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad">"stroad", or street-road</a>, where all the shops each have their own driveway and their own parking space and it's hostile to both people <em>and</em> cars.</p>
<p>You drive here (or take the bus, if you're poor and you're fine with the once-an-hour service), you shop, you drive home. You don't really spend time here. There is literally nothing here besides concrete boxes. And also the constant issue of cars driving past you. Hope you like sprinting across five lanes of traffic moving at 40 mph!</p>
<p>Enter Austrian-born architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Gruen">Victor Gruen</a>. After fleeing to America from the Nazis, on account of being a Jewish socialist, he slowly worked up the career ladder, from draftsman to architect. And he absolutely saw the issues of suburban sprawl. In the 1950s he gave a speech where he called the suburbs "avenues of horror ... flanked by the greatest collection of vulgarity ... ever collected by mankind."</p>
<p><img alt="The Strand Arcade in Sydney CBD, Australia, opened 1892" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/arcade.jpg"></p>
<p>As an alternative, he envisioned a single building, a few shops surrounded by a shared courtyard, protected from the weather. Something of an iteration of the old "arcades", like the Strand Arcade in Sydney, Australia as pictured above. The courtyard was the most substantial improvement, it was somewhere to go <em>in between</em> shopping. The arcade was just a straight hallway normally, literally just shops in a building. The shopping mall was a <em>destination</em>.</p>
<p>Victor has larger goals in mind. He expected this to be just <em>one</em> part of a new, dense, suburban community. He imagined indoor malls with housing, with schools and libraries and doctor's offices and offices, perhaps surrounded outside by high density housing …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many DevRel and community teams struggle to demonstrate how their activity impacts key metrics, like revenue.</p><p>We recently learned of a new SaaS metric proposed by <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/">OpenView Partners</a> that we think can help, since it can contextualize the results of community activity within a broader business situation, and help show the impact of community on business growth.</p><p>It’s called <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/new-saas-metric/">Natural Rate of Growth</a> (NRG), and it’s essentially, “<em>how fast a company grows without even trying—before layering on incremental investments in sales and marketing</em>.” Here’s the equation:</p><pre><code>NRG = 100 x Annual Growth Rate x % Organic Signups X % ARR from Products</code></pre><p>In other words, <strong>if your company immediately halted paid search, banner ads, outbound efforts of the sales team, and big marketing campaigns, how much and how quickly growth increase?</strong></p><p>As it turns out, <em>many companies are asking this very question</em>, which creates the perfect opportunity for DevRel and community teams to shine by influencing NRG.</p><p>NRG exists to measure a product's ability to grow through a combination of non-paid traffic and product-centric upsells, like inviting teammates and upgrading one’s plan. <strong>These are areas community teams already influence, but most don’t have a great way to communicate the impact of their effort</strong>. We think NRG is one way to tell the story.</p><p>So how can a company drive more organic signups and ARR from products?</p><h3>Community drives NRG</h3><p>At <a href="http://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>, we think<strong> one way community delivers business value through the generation of organic signups</strong>, which has the side effect of driving ARR from products.</p><p>If you have a high gravity community with engaged and passionate users, they’ll continue engaging with each other whether or not your company is actively participating.</p><p>Just look at <a href="https://community.airtable.com/">Airtable’s community forum</a>. It sees hundreds of posts per week, with the vast majority of engagement coming from non-Airtable community members. If the Airtable team stopped replying to messages for a month, the community would continue to operate.</p><p>Search engines would continue indexing discussions that happen there, and other users would continue to find helpful community-generated content. That content would drive more usage, and lead to deeper product usage and interest in paid features, like Blocks, leading to in-product upgrades. In other words, NRG would increase.</p><p>If community drives growth, how can you increase and measure and expand your community?</p><h3>Gravity helps measure a community’s growth</h3><p>In the <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">Orbit Model</a>, Gravity is the attractive force of a community that acts to retain existing members and pull in new ones, and we think it’s a key top-level metric company leadership should track.</p><p>It’s based on <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model#reach">reach</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model#love">love</a>, so an increase in gravity means two things.</p><p>First, it means the community has increased its ability to drive awareness about the community and the product it's built around (Reach). Second, it means the community has increased its level of activity, through PRs, content creation, active discussions, and more (Love).</p><p>When a community's influence and activity increase, so does its gravity.</p><h3>Gravity, NRG, and revenue</h3><p>So what about key SaaS metrics, like revenue and NRG?</p><p>Revenue is the end goal, but if community teams try to influence revenue directly, they risk alienating users with sales-centric tactics. Gravity will drop as everyone leaves the community.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/2c753578f9d8bcee8154d76bbfd88ad523c01c94-1220x470.png" alt="Text: Revenue is a natural second-order effect of high gravity. " title="Revenue &amp; Gravity"></p><p>For most communities, <strong>revenue is a natural second-order effect of high gravity</strong>. Just think of an ice cream cone. The larger the scoop on top of the cone, the more ice cream that drips down. With communities, <strong>as gravity increases, more users will end up in the adoption funnel</strong>.</p><p>That means DevRel and communities teams should focus on growing the Reach and Love of their community, leading to higher gravity, which then leads to more organic signups.</p><p>In most cases, <strong>higher gravity leads to more organic signups which leads to increased revenue.</strong></p><p>We think one effective way to demonstrate the impact of community activities, then, is by calculating NRG and showing how community and DevRel contribute.</p><p>As a result, we think DevRel leadership should consider NRG as a metric it reports on, and clearly demonstrate how community and DevRel investments move this important metric.</p></div></div>]]>

    <section id="description" data-title="Description">
      <p>Embedded applications with strong security requirements use sophisticated cryptographic algorithms and protocols. These algorithms and protocols are usually considered resistant against cryptanalysis (even if the algorithms sometimes rely on a kind of "very hard" problem which we don't know exactly how "hard" it is...) Inside the complete system they are implemented either in software or hardware form. Unfortunately any computation is eventually performed by a piece of hardware (microprocessor or hardware dedicated accelerator) and every hardware device leaks symptoms of its activity (power consumption, electromagnetic emanations, computation time, sounds, temperature variations, etc.) Attackers can exploit such "side channels" to retrieve embedded secrets. They can also inject and exploit faults by modifying the power supply, the clock frequency, shooting lasers on devices or even by modifying them. This course offers a survey of several well known hardware attacks. For each of them the conditions of success are explored and some counter measures are derived.</p>

And 14% are in distress—either challenged to meet their financial obligations or under operational pressure that requires significant restructuring. That represents a 43% increase over the previous year. The lack of additional government stimulus puts many of these companies at risk.</p><p>Those are among the most significant findings from the BCG TURN Radar index. The index, developed by BCG TURN, BCG’s special transformation, turnaround, and restructuring unit, tracks a company’s distress based on over 20 key performance indicators in three categories: financial, market, and qualitative. The Radar index reports on over 25,000 publicly-traded companies, with more than $100 million in revenue, across 80 countries and 20 industry sectors. There were 721 US companies tracked for distress. A company is measured against its peers, its industry, and the overall sample, and its score places it in one of three groups—either stable, stressed (underperforming in its industry or under internal or external pressure), or distressed.</p><p>The US picture is bleak, but not the worst on a global basis—in Central Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, the number of companies in distress has gone up 83%.</p><p>Overall, the BCG TURN Radar index portrays the US and global economy struggling as the pandemic maintains its grip.</p><h2><b>The US is hard-hit, and key sectors suffer, but others, boosted by pandemic demand, outperform</b></h2><p>Some US sectors have been particularly hard-hit—notably, those directly affected by the pandemic and those already challenged before the pandemic’s economic downdraft took hold.</p><p>Among the US industries suffering the most are automotive and mobility (52% stressed, 16% distressed), travel and tourism (61% stressed, 16% distressed), and retail (67% stressed, 18% distressed).</p><p>Health care providers, biopharma, the technology industry, and transportation and logistics have been the least impacted. All of these sectors have been boosted by pandemic-related demand. Health care providers and biopharma are showing significantly less stress than in the same period last year. Both have benefited from pandemic-related activity and investment. In 2019, almost 42% of biopharma companies were in distress. In 2020, that figure fell to 25%. In multiple sectors, there are big gaps between winners and losers, and research shows that large companies may achieve a stronger recovery.</p><p>“BCG TURN Radar confirms the impression created by stories of business failures and layoffs—the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deep, structural changes that are likely to be long-lasting,” says Luke Pototschnik, BCG senior partner, and head of the firm’s Transformation practice and BCG TURN in North America. “The impact may be most severe on companies that were challenged to begin with. But the good news is that there are actions companies can take—such as generating short-term cash to fund long-term investment—that can mitigate the worst of the downturn and help set them on the path to recovery.”</p><h2><b>Some subsectors stand out even in stressed industries, and the gap between winners and losers grows</b></h2><p>While the Radar index raises alarms about several major sectors of the US economy, it also finds winners even in underperforming sectors.</p><p>Many of the sectors faring worst are those that faced pre-pandemic structural challenges. “The automobile industry is struggling more than others,” says Pototschnik. “Even before the pandemic, it was dealing with significant changes such as the shift to electric vehicles, which requires investment. But in the pandemic economy, investment may be hard to come by.”</p><p>Similarly, the bankruptcy rate has been high in the already-challenged oil and gas sector, and Radar suggests that bankruptcies are likely to continue, with over 57% of the sector under stress and over 10% in distress.</p><p>Of more note is the widening gap between winners and losers in several sectors as some industries suffer while other outperform. “In most cases, outperformance is driven by pandemic-related consumer and business spending,” Pototschnik says.</p><ul><li>Most of the retail sector has moved from “stable” to “stressed,” with over 52% of restaurants in distress—but large groceries are doing well, with over 43% in stable territory.</li><li>Similarly, IT services are suffering, with over 50% in distress, but digital devices and services are thriving, with over 42% stable. The numbers reflect the sudden and massive shift from office work to remote work.</li><li>Shipping companies are performing strongly thanks to the upsurge in e-commerce, with 32% stable, while 47% of logistics companies are stressed as the result of an overall slowdown in global trade.</li></ul><p>“In several sectors, the gap between winners and losers is widening,” Pototschnik says. “Some of this may be the result of pandemic-related behavior patterns that will normalize over time. But some of these patterns, such as the shift to remote work, may be long-lasting, and some industry sectors may be permanently reshaped.”</p><h2><b>Bankruptcy rates will increase, data providers may thrive, and large companies have an advantage</b></h2><p>The Radar index does not predict future performance, and, as Pototschnik notes, “Prediction is made difficult by the complex dynamics of the pandemic. But the index, combined with our observation of certain macro trends, does suggest some outcomes.” Among BCG’s projections:</p><ul><li>Bankruptcy rates will increase, partly as a result of the robust and trustworthy bankruptcy process in the US and North America.</li><li>Bankruptcy is already underway in retail and in oil and gas. Telecom is in distress, in part due to its high investment requirements. Restructuring will come to manufacturing as supply chain networks are revisited, but instead of bankruptcy, transformation may take the form of changes in market structures.</li><li>Severe uncertainty is driving an appetite for data; industries and companies that provide data and analytics are likely to be strong performers. Technology will perform well in the long-term, even if the nature of office work is fundamentally changed. Travel and tourism will rebound once a vaccine Is developed, trusted, and distributed at scale. Sectors such as retail that have deeper business model problems apart from the pandemic are likely to lag.</li><li>Size may also be a predictor of survival. Radar shows that large companies, even in distressed industries, have more upside potential. “There are reasons why this makes sense,” Pototschnik says. “Large companies typically have healthier balance sheets. They have greater access to capital markets. They have more diversified product lines and portfolios. And they are less vulnerable than smaller companies to private-equity and activist intervention. All of these factors seem to add up to a greater margin of safety.”</li></ul><h2><b>Companies can take action to improve their odds</b></h2><p>Finally, individual companies can act to improve their odds for recovery. Separate BCG TURN research identifies the steps that leading companies take in times of crisis that lead to superior performance. Leading companies act proactively, investing in projects that generate short-term cash in order to fund long-term investments. They increase the pace of innovation, streamline the organization to maximize efficiency and capitalize on digital, and build crisis management and scenario planning capabilities to increase their resilience. “Companies that took these steps during the 2008–2009 financial crisis recovered faster and performed better than their peers,” Pototschnik says.</p><p>“The COVID-19 pandemic is a massive historic event—it is stressing companies, industries, and national and global economies to the limit,” Pototschnik says. “BCG TURN Radar indicates that that the stress is severe, and many organizations will be forced to restructure. But those that take a strategic view of restructuring and look at it as an opportunity to rethink their business stand a better chance of leading when the recovery ultimately arrives.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fmore-than-half-of-us-companies-are-under-financial-or-operational-stress-and-14-are-in-distress-as-pandemics-economic-impact-deepens-301201503.html&amp;t=ZTMyMTJhNzE2YjU3YzBiOTY4OTRmMTE3YjRmNWNlMDU5OTkzZWQzOCxQMVFpanA2SA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F639600728973934592%2F60-percent-of-us-companies-are-under-stress&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182415">Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/624363186289852416/new-normal-for-tech-webinar">Shaping the new normal for tech post COVID-19 (webinar)</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A team of scientists at Freie Universität Berlin has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) method for calculating the ground state of the Schrödinger equation in quantum chemistry. The goal of quantum chemistry is to predict chemical and physical properties of molecules based solely on the arrangement of their atoms in space, avoiding the need for resource-intensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments. In principle, this can be achieved by solving the Schrödinger equation, but in practice this is extremely difficult. Up to now, it has been impossible to find an exact solution for arbitrary molecules that can be efficiently computed. But the team at Freie Universität has developed a deep learning method that can achieve an unprecedented combination of accuracy and computational efficiency. AI has transformed many technological and scientific areas, from computer vision to materials science. “We believe that our approach may significantly impact the future of quantum chemistry,” says Professor Frank Noé, who led the team effort. The results were published in the reputed journal <em>Nature Chemistry</em> (DOI: <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0544-y">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0544-y</a>).</p><div><p>Central to both quantum chemistry and the Schrödinger equation is the wave function – a mathematical object that completely specifies the behavior of the electrons in a molecule. The wave function is a high-dimensional entity, and it is therefore extremely difficult to capture all the nuances that encode how the individual electrons affect each other. Many methods of quantum chemistry in fact give up on expressing the wave function altogether, instead attempting only to determine the energy of a given molecule. This however requires approximations to be made, limiting the prediction quality of such methods.</p>
<p>Other methods represent the wave function with the use of an immense number of simple mathematical building blocks, but such methods are so complex that they are impossible to put into practice for more than a mere handful of atoms. “Escaping the usual trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is the highest achievement in quantum chemistry,” explains Dr. Jan Hermann of Freie Universität Berlin, who designed the key features of the method in the study. “As yet, the most popular such outlier is the extremely cost-effective density functional theory. We believe that deep “Quantum Monte Carlo,” the approach we are proposing, could be equally, if not more successful. It offers unprecedented accuracy at a still acceptable computational cost.”</p>
<p>The deep neural network designed by Professor Noé’s team is a new way of representing the wave functions of electrons. “Instead of the standard approach of composing the wave function from relatively simple mathematical components, we designed an artificial neural network capable of learning the complex patterns of how electrons are located around the nuclei,” Noé explains. “One peculiar feature of electronic wave functions is their antisymmetry. When two electrons are exchanged, the wave function must change its sign. We had to build this property into the neural network architecture for the approach to work,” adds Hermann. This feature, known as “Pauli’s exclusion principle,” is why the authors called their method “PauliNet.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the Pauli exclusion principle, electronic wave functions also have other fundamental physical properties, and much of the innovative success of PauliNet is that it integrates these properties into the deep neural network, rather than letting deep learning figure them out by just observing the data. “Building the fundamental physics into the AI is essential for its ability to make meaningful predictions in the field,” says Noé. “This is really where scientists can make a substantial contribution to AI, and exactly what my group is focused on.”</p>
<p>There are still many challenges to overcome before Hermann and Noé’s method is ready for industrial application. “This is still fundamental research,” the authors agree, “but it is a fresh approach to an age-old problem in the molecular and material sciences, and we are excited about the possibilities it opens up.”</p>

									<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: In an equity round, including seed equity, any post-closing dilution is shared proportionately between investors and common stockholders (founders and employees). This is fair. Assuming no shenanigans and the business is increasing in value, why shouldn’t dilution be shared? Convertible notes and pre-money SAFEs have a math formula that makes them more dilutive to founders than an equity round with an equivalent valuation, by “protecting” seed investors from some post-closing dilution. Post-Money SAFEs are&nbsp;<em>even worse</em>. The solution is fairly simple: “fix” or harden the denominator in the conversion price formula, instead of having it dependent on complex language and variables. This gives everyone the benefit of a “floating” valuation that is so valuable in convertible instruments, while making post-closing dilution mechanics equivalent to an equity round.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are 3 main instruments being used by startups in seed rounds: equity, convertible notes, and SAFEs. From a historical standpoint, equity (issuing actual stock at a fixed price) is the default instrument, but for reasons of speed and flexibility (on pricing), convertible notes and SAFEs have gained traction in early rounds smaller than about $2 million in total funding (the number in Silicon Valley is a bit higher).</p>
<h3>Equity Math</h3>
<p>While glossing over a few nuances, the formula for setting the price of stock sold in an equity round is fairly simple: <strong>pre-money&nbsp;valuation</strong> divided by&nbsp;<strong>capitalization.</strong> The higher the valuation, obviously the higher price. But importantly, the higher the capitalization (the denominator), the&nbsp;<em>lower</em> the price. In equity term sheet negotiations there is often some (necessary) back-and-forth around what actually gets included in the capitalization denominator. For example, being forced to put any increases in the option pool is fairly common. Somewhat less common but still extremely impactful is being forced to put all of your existing convertible instruments (notes or SAFEs) in the denominator. In this sense, two startups can have the same “pre-money valuation” but dramatically different actual stock prices (price paid by investors) if they negotiated different denominators.</p>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<p>Pre-money Valuation: $10 million</p>
<p>Capitalization on your date of closing, including option pool increase in the round: 10 million shares</p>
<p>Math: valuation ($10 million) / capitalization (10 million shares) = investors pay $1 per share of preferred stock.</p>
<p>Simple enough. Fixed valuation, fixed capitalization, and you get a fixed price for easy modeling. Any financings (excluding down rounds) that happen after your equity round dilute the <em>entire</em> cap table proportionately.&nbsp;But the “math” for convertible notes and SAFEs is not so simple, and not as favorable as an equity round.</p>
<h3>Convertible Note and Pre-Money SAFE Math (more dilutive)</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/03/04/notes-safes-extra-dilutive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Convertible Notes and SAFES are extra dilutive</a> I explained how&nbsp;the typical math of convertible notes and SAFEs makes them&nbsp;<em>extra dilutive</em> to founders/startups compared to an equity round. To summarize: because convertibles fail to “harden” the conversion math for the investors, convertibles allow seed investors to pack more shares into the denominator. Remember: higher denominator = lower price, which means the seed investors pay less and get more of the cap table even without changing the “valuation.” In an equity round, increases to the option pool after you close get absorbed by your seed investors pro-rata, but not so in&nbsp;<em>typical</em> convertible note math. Your seed note holders get “protected” from that dilution by including the pool increases in their denominator up until closing.</p>
<p>The fact that the denominator in convertible notes (and SAFEs, which are derived from convertible notes) isn’t fixed is actually a remnant from when convertible notes were traditionally used mostly for “bridge” rounds closed only a few weeks or months before a Series A. When your convertible round is truly a “bridge” for an equity raise in a few weeks, having your note investors get the same denominator as your Series A investors makes sense. But&nbsp;<em>today</em> seed rounds are being closed 2-3&nbsp;<em>years</em> before a Series A. Keeping the denominator “open” for that long does not make sense.</p>
<p>So, keeping valuation constant, <strong>convertible notes and traditional pre-money SAFEs are&nbsp;<em>more</em> dilutive</strong> than an equity round because the denominator is larger. Why do startups use them then? Speed and flexibility.</p>
<p>First, given how early-stage fundraising and company-building has evolved, many (but certainly not all) seed rounds lack a true lead willing to hire their own counsel and negotiate hardened seed equity terms. Also, at the very early stages of a startup, pegging the exact valuation that investors are willing to pay can be difficult given the lack of data and track record. The&nbsp;<em>valuation cap</em> concept in Notes and SAFEs allows startups to set a proxy for the valuation, while flexibly allowing seed investors to get a lower price if the Series A valuation ends up in fact being lower than what was originally expected. <strong>Valuation flexibility (via a cap, as opposed to a fixed valuation) is a big reason why</strong>,<strong> despite the advantages of seed equity, many young startups still opt for convertibles.&nbsp;</strong>The ability to incrementally increase the cap over time, as milestones are reached, is also seen as valuable flexibility offered by convertible instruments.</p>
<h3>Post-Money SAFE Math (even more dilutive)</h3>
<p>A while back Y Combinator completely re-vamped the math behind their SAFEs, converting it to a&nbsp;<em>post-money</em> formula. See: <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2019/05/01/startups-shouldnt-use-yc-post-money-safe/">Why Startups shouldn’t use YC’s Post-Money SAFE</a>. Rather than setting a&nbsp;<em>pre-money</em> valuation cap, startups using the post-money SAFE are now required to set a&nbsp;<em>post-money</em> valuation, including all money they expect to raise as seed. YC’s stated reason for changing the math on the SAFE was to make it “easier” to model how much a company is giving to seed investors, but as discussed in the blog post, anyone who’s deep in this game and unbiased knows that claim is smoke and mirrors. The formula change made the SAFE structure&nbsp;<em>far</em> more favorable to investors (including YC) economically.</p>
<p>What was really happening was that because pre-money SAFEs had exactly zero accountability protections relative to seed equity and convertible notes – the maturity date in notes constrains the ability of startups to keep raising more and more rounds without converting the seed round into equity – seed investors in SAFEs were getting burned by startups raising SAFE rounds for years and years without ever converting. As an investor, YC itself was getting burned. So they changed the SAFE to be more investor friendly, benefiting YC and all seed investors.</p>
<p>But in the opinion of&nbsp;<em>many</em> ecosystem players, including lawyers focused on representing companies (and not the investor community), the change was egregiously one-sided. It effectively forces founders and employees (common stockholders) to absorb all dilution for any other convertible note or SAFE rounds that they raise after the post-money SAFE round, even if the valuation cap is higher. That’s an extremely high price to pay just for making modeling seed rounds a little easier. I have a better (fairer) idea.</p>
<h3>“Fix” the Denominator in Notes and Pre-Money SAFEs (same dilution as equity round)</h3>
<p>The benefit of convertible notes and SAFEs is flexibility and speed. They are simpler, and allow you to have a “floating” (flexible) valuation (cap) that helps companies and investors get aligned despite the uncertainty. This “floating numerator” is important and valuable.</p>
<p>But as discussed above, while the benefit of notes/SAFEs is a more flexible numerator (valuation), the benefit of seed equity math is you get a hardened denominator. That hardened denominator ensures that everyone (common stock and investors) shares&nbsp;<em>pro-rata</em> in post-closing capitalization changes, like future rounds and option pool changes. Everyone has appropriately-apportioned “skin in the game.” Another benefit of this hardened capitalization (denominator) is that it makes modeling the round easier. Wasn’t that what YC&nbsp;<em>says</em> they were trying to do with the Post-Money SAFE? Why not make modeling easier without hurting founders with harsher dilution?</p>
<p><strong>So the “best of both worlds” solution is: do a convertible note or pre-money SAFE, but harden the denominator with the capitalization at the time of closing.</strong> You can even ensure it has an appropriately sized pool to account for expected equity grants until the next raise, much like you would in an equity round. Flexible numerator, but hardened denominator.</p>
<p>Making this change in a convertible note or SAFE is extremely easy. You simply delete all the language used for describing the denominator (the fully-diluted capitalization) and replace it with a number: your capitalization at the time of closing. Now both sides have the benefit of a valuation cap that adjusts if there is a “down round,” but a hardened denominator that allows everyone to model the expected dilution of the round; while ensuring that&nbsp;<em>future dilution</em> is shared proportionately between both founders and investors.</p>
<p>On top of being far more aligned with equity round economics (the default approach to fundraising), this approach can save common stockholders several percentage points on their cap table; a <span>very</span> high impact from just deleting a few words and replacing them with a number. <strong>When a seed equity raise won’t do, my recommendation is usually a low-interest, lengthy (2-3 yrs) maturity convertible note with a valuation cap and hardened denominator. </strong>As a lawyer who represents&nbsp;<em>zero</em> investors (all companies), I’ve felt that pre-money SAFEs are too company-biased, and post-money SAFEs are too investor-biased. SAFEs in general are also far less respected by investors outside of Silicon Valley than convertible notes are.</p>
<p>We’ve been explaining this issue to clients and investors and are happy to say that there has been a positive reception. We hope to see it …</p></div></div>

This is in some ways a rational response to elite failures, in some ways an inevitable consequence of the public becoming better educated, in some ways an unavoidable side effect of better information technology, and in some ways a deplorable thing that we should try to reverse. </p><p>But something I’ve become increasingly convinced of is that policymakers need to acknowledge that it’s a real feature of the landscape and adjust their decision-making accordingly. </p><p>In particular, they need to adjust it in an appropriate way. A very large share of the people involved in politics and government are lawyers, and their lawyerly instinct about the problem seems to be that you need to layer on more layers of process. If people are worried about the discretionary use of power, you need to make sure the decision-makers go through an elaborate compliance checklist. But as Princess Leia tried to explain to Grand Moff Tarkin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wntX-a3jSY">“the more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.”</a> </p><p>When you try to address low trust through compliance, you end up where Andrew Cuomo is —&nbsp;he’s creating an elaborate checklist for vaccine prioritization which is hard to follow, so he’s ramping up penalties for people who don’t comply, which is slowing vaccine administration and further eroding trust. </p><p>But the same basic problem pops up everywhere from fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing to <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2020/12/31/streets-before-trust/">bike lanes</a>. </p><p>The correct way to respond to a low-trust environment is not to double down on proceduralism, but to commit yourself to the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2020/12/31/streets-before-trust/">“it does exactly what it says on the tin”</a> principle and implement policies that have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li><p>It’s easy for everyone, whether they agree with you or disagree with you, to understand what it is you say you are doing. </p></li><li><p>It’s easy for everyone to see whether or not you are, in fact, doing what you said you would do. </p></li><li><p>It’s easy for you and your team to meet the goal of doing the thing that you said you would do. </p></li></ul><p>That’s not a guarantee of political or policy success. Maybe you will pick terrible ideas and be a huge failure anyway. But this triad for success under conditions of distrust at least creates the <em>possibility</em> of success, where people will look back and decide that what you did worked. Committing yourself to that triad may involve some waste and inefficiency relative to a more theoretically optimal scheme with more means-testing. </p><p>And it will almost certainly involve a bit more high-handedness and less community consultation. But it allows you to establish yourself as conditionally trustworthy in the sense that your policies do exactly what it says on the tin. And if you pick policies that work, you’re then in a position to rebuild trust as people see that confidence in you is rewarded.</p><h4>The vaccine prioritization fiasco</h4><p>In my December 18 post, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/vaccinate-elderly">“Give The Vaccine To The Elderly,”</a> I argued in favor of a pretty strict age-based prioritization system primarily because that would be a transparent and easy to implement mechanism. </p><p>As I researched it, I came across the fact — which has been flagged by others as well — that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was recommending a more complicated scheme in part on racial justice grounds. Because everyone loves culture war arguments, this became a huge controversy and several conservative states like Texas made big shows of rejecting the Social Justice Warrior concepts. That’s fine, but unfortunately, they did not accept the wisdom of implementing a transparent and easy to implement mechanism. </p><p>Instead, operating under the principle that everyone wants to be vaccinated in Group 1 they have divided Group 1 into three subgroups — 1A, 1B, and 1C. But then Group 1A is <a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/immunize/vaccine/EVAP-Phase1A.pdf">subdivided into two separate tiers</a>, and we’re still awaiting word on how Group 1C will be subdivided, to say nothing of Group 2 or Group 3. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c22295e8-22ca-4271-b6f1-392f1e0b1c59_1286x540.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:1286,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:280147,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>So while New York and California, with their presumably more social justice-inflected vaccine distributions, have managed to disburse only 31 percent and 28 percent of their vaccine doses (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html">I’m going by New York Times data</a>), Texas and Florida, who made a big deal of rejecting ACIP, are not doing much better at 36 percent and 31 percent. The very worst performances are in Kansas, Georgia, Arizona, Mississippi, and Idaho, so there’s clearly a lot more afoot here than pure partisan politics. </p><p>And in many ways we still haven’t gotten to the real pain point of prioritization systems, which is going to be where people with “at least one chronic medical condition” get to cut the line. In the abstract, of course if you’re 52 and have a bad heart then you need the vaccine more than someone who’s 64 and in perfect health. But in practice, this means you are allocating vaccines not based on <em>actual</em> population health, but based on who is in possession of a note from their doctor. </p><p>The system, as implemented, will not do what it says on the tin. As people notice that, they will become more aggressive about wanting to cheat the system. And as backlash builds, pressure will build for tighter enforcement, which will further slow down administration. </p><p>A pure age-based system — “show up at CVS or Walgreens and they’ll give you the shot if you’re over 75” with the age cutoff steadily dropping over time —&nbsp;is not perfect. But it’s really easy to check people’s IDs, the rich and powerful have no good way to game that system, and the smooth operation of the system itself will build trust.</p><h4>Checks for everyone </h4><p>I cover American public policy professionally, and I would have trouble explaining to you exactly how the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program">Paycheck Protection Program</a> works. </p><p>Formally speaking, it’s a Small Business Administration loan guarantee program rather than a direct payroll subsidy like many European countries did. But when you peak under the hood, one of the key advantages of the PPP loan is that it will be forgiven if you meet certain criteria, including <a href="https://onpay.com/covid-19/ppp-loan-forgiveness">not laying off your employees</a> and using the money for certain <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program#section-header-5">specific eligible expenses</a>. </p><p>Because the program is complicated, it’s generated an endless series of compliance complaints:</p><ul><li><p>Because it’s supposed to be a small business program, a whole genre of journalism emerged complaining that too much PPP money was going to bigger companies —&nbsp;but of course, bigger companies employ more people.</p></li><li><p>Because it’s supposed to be a loan program but in practice a lot of the loans are forgiven, you get complaints about monetary losses to the government.</p></li><li><p>Because you’re <em>allowed</em> to accept a loan without applying for full forgiveness, some PPP recipients got money and did layoffs, generating complaints that it didn’t really protect payrolls.</p></li></ul><p>And on top of all that, there were significant administrative burdens associated with the program which generated a lot of complaints from business owners, the very people who are supposed to be enthusiastic about PPP.</p><p>Instead, a myth developed that the government — which put hundreds of billions of dollars in small business assistance on the table — was barely doing anything.</p><p>Fundamentally, I would say that the problem with the program is that it didn’t do what it says on the tin, in part because it’s not at all clear what it said on the tin. It seems to have started with the thought that the Fed keeping interest rates low was helping big businesses because they could sell bonds to ride out the pandemic, so there should be a comparable lending program for smaller companies. But if the government is going to help out smaller companies, it should make sure that it’s actually saving jobs. And if we’re going to give companies loans to maintain payroll, but they’re often not going to be able to pay the loan back, there should be loan forgiveness. In the end, Congress backed itself into something that was a lot closer to a European-style payroll subsidy program than to a loan program, but with most of the trappings of a loan program.</p><p>By contrast, sending $1,200 to almost everyone was seen as a huge success, and <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/12/28/78-of-likely-voters-support-2000-relief-checks">sending more checks is wildly popular</a>. </p><p>The checks did what they said on the tin. They didn’t attempt to distinguish between the deserving and the undeserving. They didn’t specify whether you had to use the check to make rent or could just blow it on a new iPhone. And they <em>also</em> didn’t attempt to address any particular racial social justice concerns. Critically, they didn’t claim to do any of these things. The only claim was that almost everyone would get some money, and they did. </p><h4>QE for the people </h4><p>A policy from the Great Recession that really flunked the “what it says on the tin” test was quantitative easing. </p><p>I think if you really understand how monetary policy works and have confidence in the Federal Reserve staff, then you’ll see that having the Fed buy a bunch of longer-term bonds is really not that exciting or weird. But most people don’t. </p><p>And unfortunately, as you become better-informed about monetary issues, it doesn’t actually become that much clearer why the Fed decided this would be a good thing to do. During a funny 2014 Brookings appearance, Ben Bernanke <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b164d2e-4f03-11e4-9c88-00144feab7de">quipped</a> that “the problem with quantitative easing is that it works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory.”</p><p>But think about that in terms of a low-trust society; the guy we’re supposed to trust to do the QE himself says he can’t give an explanation of how it works. </p><ul><li><p>Now of course you can read <a href="https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/10/bernankes-speech-how-does-quantitative-easing-work-will-it-work.html">Tim Duy offer five mechanisms through which QE could work</a> back in 2010 — but he’s skeptical that the tools are powerful.</p></li><li><p>By 2016, Roger Farmer says that Bernanke is wrong and QE <em>does</em> work in theory, and <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/why-unconventional-monetary-policy-works-theory">offers a theoretical account of why it works</a> that is somewhat different from any of Duy’s theories.</p></li><li><p>By 2020, Bernanke has come around to the view that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2020/01/04/the-new-tools-of-monetary-policy/">he now understands why QE works in theory</a>, though his view is closer to Duy’s than to Farmer’s. </p></li></ul><p>If you’re an insider to macroeconomic policy discussions, Bernanke’s quote is funny.

<p>Whilst UnixBench might seem like an unusual benchmark for a router lets look at this as if it was another cheap SBC. It performs about as expected coming in slightly faster than the first generation Raspberry Pi. </p>

    <h2 id="how-i-decided-to-write-a-spellchecker-and-almost-died-trying">How I decided to write a spellchecker and almost died trying</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had a fun idea for a “weekend project”: pure-Ruby spellchecker. Ruby is my language of choice, and no-dependencies spellchecker seemed a small useful tool for the CI environment: for example, to check comments/docs spelling without installing any third-party software. I actually <em>could’ve</em> pulled out the project in its limited scope (only English, only spot misspelled words without fixing, limited dictionary) with just a flat list of known words, but that’s not what happened.</p>

<p>Back then, I decided to make a moderately generic tool, at least able to work with multiple languages. Fortunately (or so I believed!), there were many already existing and freely available spellchecking dictionaries distributed as LibreOffice and Firefox extensions. All of those dictionaries are in the format defined by the <strong><a href="http://hunspell.github.io/">Hunspell</a></strong> tool/library—which is an open-source library that is used for spellchecking in Libre/OpenOffice, Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird), but also Google Chrome/Chromium, macOS, several Adobe products, and so on.</p>

<p>The dictionaries looked like easy to reuse text files with some (“insignificant” as it seemed) metadata, and the whole “use Hunspell dictionaries from pure Ruby spellchecker” project <em>still</em> felt like a “weekend-long” one, for the first few weekends. Only gradually the underwater complexity of the multilanguage word-by-word spellchecking uncovered. Eventually, I was distracted from the project and abandoned it, but I still had the fascination with the seemingly-simple, actually-mind-blowingly-complicated Hunspell, the software everybody used daily and hardly ever notice.</p>

<p>The idea to dig deeper into it, to <em>understand</em> it and <em>explain</em>, grew on me and bothered me for quite some time. And what is a better way to understand something, if not to retell it in your own words? After several lazy and not very far-progressed attempts to write something Hunspell-alike (twice in Ruby, once in Rust, once in Python), eventually, in February 2020, the task I settled down to solve is: “explanatory rewrite” of the Hunspell into high-level language with a lot of comments. I achieved this goal by December 2020, with the first release of the <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> project: <strong>the port of Hunspell’s core algorithms into modern, well-documented, well-structured Python</strong>.</p>

<p>And now I want to share some insights of what I uncovered on the road: about spellchecking in general and Hunspell in particular.</p>

<p>In the ongoing article series, I’ll cover these topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Hunspell, why is it significant, and why try to “explain” it (current article)</li>
  <li>Base spellchecking concepts: lookup and suggest, as seen by Hunspell</li>
  <li>How lookup (checking if the word is correct) works, and why it could be much more complicated than “just look in the list of the known words”</li>
  <li>How suggest (proposed fix for the incorrect word) works, and how hard it is to estimate its quality</li>
  <li>A closer look into Hunspell’s dictionary format. It is the most widespread open dictionary format in the world, and we’ll see what linguistic and algorithmic information it <em>potentially</em> can carry, and what part of it is actually used in existing dictionaries</li>
  <li>Some details on Spylls implementation process and results</li>
  <li>Closing thoughts on the big picture of word-by-word spellchecker problem, and Hunspell’s approach to it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-hunspell">What is Hunspell?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The information on Hunspell’s origins and history is mostly my guesses, following partial and incomplete sources everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hunspell (<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell">Wikpedia article</a></small>), initially <strong>Hun</strong>garian spellchecker, emerged as an alternative for previously existing aspell/ispell/myspell somewhere in 2002 (I guess?). It was created by László Németh, in a need of supporting languages with complicated suffixing/prefixing rules and word compounding (such as Hungarian). Hunspell’s design seemingly proved itself to be flexible enough to support most of the world’s languages, and in a few years, it became the most used spellchecker in the world. You have most probably used it even if you’ve never heard the name before today: Hunspell is the default spellchecking engine in Chrome and Firefox, Libre/OpenOffice, Adobe products, and macOS (not an exhaustive list). Dictionaries in Hunspell format exist for almost all actively used languages for which the concept of word-by-word spellchecking makes sense<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Currently, Hunspell is maintained <a href="https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell">on GitHub</a> (repo has only around 1k stars, will you believe it?). It seems that maintenance is not that easy if you’ll weight the number of open issues and PRs, and the latest commits timeline: at the time of writing it (Jan 2021), the last commit to master was of May 2020, and the last release was 1.7 on Dec 2018. Hunspell’s codebase is mostly “old-school” C++. It is being slowly modernized and it has very few comments; there are thousands of two-branch <code>if</code>s to handle non-Unicode and Unicode text separately. There is also an attempt to rewrite Hunspell from scratch in a modern C++, which at some point was developed under the <code>hunspell</code> GitHub organization. Now it is independent and called <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> (and, while not yet supporting all of the Hunspell features, already “achieved” version 4.2.0).</p>

<p>Obviously, there are open-source spellcheckers other than Hunspell. GNU aspell (that at one point was superseded by Hunspell, but still holds its ground in English suggestion quality), to name one of the older ones; but also there are novel approaches, like <a href="https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell">SymSpell</a>, claiming to be “1 million times faster” or ML-based <a href="https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell">JamSpell</a>, claiming to be much more accurate.</p>

<p>And yet, what makes Hunspell stand out is its coverage of the world’s languages. It is not ideal, but the amount of dictionaries ready to use immediately, and amount of <em>experience</em> of dealing with typical problems and corner cases, coded into the codebase, is hard to beat.</p>

<h3 id="why-rewrite-it">Why rewrite it?</h3>

<p>As I’ve already stated above, the goal of the Spylls project was to create an <em>explanatory</em> rewrite: E.g., the “retelling” of how Hunspell works in a way that is easy to follow and to play with.</p>

<p>The necessity of this approach came to me from three facts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hunspell is used almost everywhere and is taken for granted;</li>
  <li>It is much more complicated than one might naively expect;</li>
  <li>This complexity—and years of human work that was spent growing the project—is notoriously hard to follow through the Hunspell’s codebase and grasp in full.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, I wanted to <strong>make the knowledge behind Hunspell more open</strong>.</p>

<p>The way I have chosen was not, of course, the only one possible. I could’ve just read through the original code and write a series of articles (or, rather, a book?) on how it works. I could’ve thoroughly commented and republished the original source code. But I felt that <em>reimplementing</em> is the only way of understanding what’s and why’s of the algorithms (at least for somebody not being a Hunspell’s core developer); and that implementation in a high-level language will allow focusing on words and language-related algorithms, not memory management or fighting with Unicode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that there are also a few “pragmatic” ports of Hunspell into other languages (in order to use it in environments where C++ dependency is undesireable), namely <a href="https://github.com/aarondandy/WeCantSpell.Hunspell">WeCantSpell.Hunspell</a> in C# and <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/nspell">nspell</a> in JS (very incomplete); and aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> can also be considered a “port” (from legacy C++ to a modern one).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-python">Why Python?</h3>

<p>My language of choice is Ruby. It was also the first language that I’ve tried to port Hunspell into. I’d be happy to proceed with Ruby if my goal has been just a “pragmatic” library. And yet, when I decided that my goal is to make the knowledge of Hunspell’s algorithms accessible to a wide audience, I understood that Ruby is not the best choice: language reputation (slightly esoteric and mostly-for-web) would make my project lest noticeable; and my preferred coding style (mix of OO and functional, with lots of small immutable domain objects and fluent chains of iterators), while allowing me to be very effective, would make the code less accessible to other languages users.</p>

<p>What I needed was a high-level language, with as low boilerplate as possible; as mainstream as possible; as easy to experiment with and prototype as possible. Without diving into too much argument here, Python and modern JavaScript seemed to be the most suitable options, and, to be honest, Python was just closer to my soul. So, here we are!</p>

<p>The code style is mostly imperative (as it corresponds to how Hunspell is structured), with large-ish, but clearly structured methods, and a small number of classes/objects (mostly they are either “whole algorithm as a class” or almost-passive “structs” – or, in Python, dataclasses). I tried to limit myself in the usage of complex Python-specific features (like functools or itertools), but have a decent use of “list comprehensions” (as they are quite readable and Pythonic) and generators (lazy lists). Overall, I wanted the code to be good Python, but not too smart. Whether I succeeded, is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> has <strong>≈1.5k lines of library code</strong> in 14 files. It conforms (with <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#completeness">some reservations</a>) to all Hunspell’s integrational tests. Those tests look like a set of files each, consisting of “test dictionary + what words should be considered good, what words should be considered bad, what should be suggested instead of the bad words”, and there are <strong>127 of such sets to pass</strong>. There are <strong>2 thousand comment lines</strong> in the code, explaining thoroughly every detail of the algorithm and rendered at the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell.html">Spylls documentation site</a>; note that besides docstrings at the beginning of each class and method, there are also inline comments in code—that’s why the documentation site uses custom theme with inline “Show code” feature.</p>

<hr>

<p>With this being said, I am wrapping up the introductory post.</p>

<p><strong>In the next series: An introduction to Hunspell’s “lookup” and “suggest” concepts; and deeper dive into the lookup.</strong></p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" name="2015-06-16.1" href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16.1">A constructive look at the Atari 2600 BASIC cartridge</a></h3>

<!-- Atari 2600 VCS, Atari 2600 BASIC, BASIC, IDE, integrated development system -->

<p>I installed <a href="http://stella.sourceforge.net/">Stella</a>
(an <a href="http://www.atariage.com/2600/">Atari 2600 VCS emulator</a>),
downloaded the <a href="http://atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=15">Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> cartridge</a>
and have been playing around with it for the past few days.
If I'm going to do some <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/14.1">Stupid Twitter Trick™</a> with it,
I might as well know how it works,
right?</p>

<p>And thus,
this review.</p>

<p>Honestly,
I don't think the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> has ever had a fair review.
It's pretty much reviled as a horrible program,
a horrible programming environment
and practically useless.
But I think that's selling it short.
Yes,
it's bad (and I'll get to that in a bit),
but in using it for the past few days,
there are some impressive features on a system where the <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> can't hold a full Tweet and half the <acronym title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</acronym> time is spent 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/026201257X/conmanlaborat-20">Racing The Beam</a>.
I'll get the bad out of the way first.</p>

<p>Input comes from the <a href="http://atariage.com/controller_page.html?ControllerID=4&amp;SystemID=2600">Atari Keypads</a>,
dual 12-button keypads.
If that weren't bad enough,
<em>I'm</em> using my keyboard as an emulated pair of Atari Keypads,
where I have to keep <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16/AtariKeypad.jpg" type="image/jpeg">this image</a> open at all times.</p>

<p>Okay,
here's how this works.
I want to enter this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>A←A+1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(Ah yes!
The “left arrow” for assignment.
Mathematicians rejoice!) 
Upon startup,
the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> cursor is white.
This is important,
because this tells you what mode you are in.
Hit a key when the cursor is white,
and you do the functions labeled in white above each key.
To get an “A,” you hit the bottom center button on the left controller
(the one with the arrow circling around it) until the cursor turns <em>blue</em>,
then you can hit the upper left key on the left controller (labeled “STATUS + A IF”).
It's a bit hard to see,
but yes, that “A” is indeed blue.</p>

<p>To get the “←” symbol 
(it's the top right button on the left controller)
you hit the bottom middle button the the left controller until the cursor cycles back to red,
then hit the upper right button on the left controller.
Then cycle the cursor back to blue to get the “A,”
then cycle to red to get the “plus” and the “1” 
(top left button on the right controller).</p>

<p>That's probably bad enough on the real thing.
On the <em>simulated Atarti 2600?</em>
Okay,
what key on my keyboard is the “cycle” key?
Then what key is the “A” key?
Here's what I have to type to get that line of code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>xx1xxx3x1xxx19
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But to be honest,
it's on par with other <a href="http://www.ganjatron.net/retrocomputing/zx81/zx81-kbd.jpg" type="image/jpeg">keyboards of the time</a> and may be a bit better,
having actual tactile feedback instead of a simple membrane.
I'm also <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2000/02/15.1">picky about keyboards</a> so I'm <em>always</em> going to bitch about the keyboard unless it's an 
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/why-i-use-a-20-year-old-ibm-model-m-keyboard/">IBM model M</a>.</p>

<p>And given that the Atari 2600 only has 128 <em>bytes</em> of memory,
it's expected that the programs are going to be rather short.
I at first thought that you had 64 bytes for the program,
but no—it's 64 bytes for the program, <em>variables and runtime expression evaluation!</em>
That actually surprised me.
Even worse,
running this program over and over again (spaces added for clarity):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>1 A ← 1
2 B ← 2
3 PRINT A,B
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><em>leaks memory!</em></p>

<p>No,
really,
that program,
if run multiple times,
will eventually exhaust all of memory.
But not all programs leak memory.
This program,
if run over and over again (more on this little program in a bit):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>1 D ← 1
2 HOR1 ← HOR1 + D
3 IF HOR1 =  0 THEN GOTO 5
4 IF HOR1 ← 99 THEN GOTO 2
5 D ← 99 - D + 1
6 GOTO 2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>won't leak so much as a byte.
Go figure.</p>

<p>Worse though,
is that each variabled used in the program
(and it doesn't matter if it's a predefined variable like <code>HOR1</code> or a user defined variable like <code>A</code>)
consumes <em>three bytes</em> out of the precious 64 bytes you get for your program!
On the plus side though,
unused variables (event the builtin ones) don't use space at all
(I figured this out by watching the <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> use in Stella).</p>

<p>The grahics are pretty pathetic as well.
There are two dots that can be manipulated.
The builtin variables <code>HOR1</code> and <code>VER1</code> control the horizontal and vertical position for one dot;
<code>HOR2</code> and <code>VER2</code> are used for the other dot.
The colors are fixed.
Oh,
and if the builtin variable <code>HIT</code> is 1,
the two dots are in the same position.</p>

<p>The positions are themselves limited to 0 to 99,
but that's because <em>all</em> variables are limited to the range 0 to 99.
The values wrap though—add 1 to 99 and you get 0.
Subtract 1 from 0 and you get 99.</p>

<p>Which leads us into the ugly.</p>

<p>Yes,
there are no negative values—everything is unsigned.
And the values are all limited from 0 to 99.
This stems from a unique feature of the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</acronym>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6507">the 6507</a>
(a cheaper variation on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a>).
That <acronym title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</acronym> can do math in either binary <em>or</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary-coded decimal</a>
and the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> uses the binary-coded decimal mode, which restricts the values from 0 to 99.
So while you don't have negative numbers,
you do in a way because of the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">the math works</a>.
99 plus 99 is 198,
but because the range is modulus 100,
the result is 98. 
Add 99 again,
and you end up with 97.  
I use this fact in the above program.
Line 5 negates <code>D</code>—it converts 99 to 1,
or 1 back to 99.
Essentially,
1 to -1 and back again,
causing the dot to slowly crawl back and forth across the screen.</p>

<p>But now we finally arrive at what's good,
or rather,
what's amazing about this program.</p>

<p>First and foremost,
it's an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>Dispite it being only 4,096 bytes,
there's a pretty credible,
windowed(!) integrated development environment in there.
If you look back at the <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16/AtariKeypad.jpg" type="image/jpeg">keypad</a>,
you'll notice the first six buttons on the left controller are labeled:</p>

<ol>
<li>STATUS</li>
<li>PROGRAM</li>
<li>STACK</li>
<li>VARIABLES</li>
<li>OUTPUT</li>
<li>GRAPHICS</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the various “windows” (and technically,
they <em>are</em> windows,
even if they don't overlap but are instead,
stacked vertically on the screen)
and the buttons there toggle the “windows” on and off.</p>

<p>The “STATUS” window 
(you can see it in the screen shot from <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/14.1">the other day</a>) 
shows memory usage (how many bytes,
called “symbols”) and how fast the program will run
(1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30 and 60 are the speed values and they reflect how often the interpreter is run—once a second,
twice a second, on up to 60 times a second).
The “PROGRAM” window obviously contains the program
(all nine lines if you have that many—and
the <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> automatically numbers the lines for you even though it doesn't use them or store them—more on that below).</p>

<p>The “VARIABLES” window contains a list of the variables used in the program, listed as:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>A is 1
HOR1 is 40
B is 2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>“OUTPUT” is the text output window;
output of <code>PRINT</code>.  “GRAPHICS” is the laughable graphics screen.</p>

<p>Leaving the “STACK” window,
which is a misnomer actually.
It's not a true stack,
since there is no concept of “subroutine” in the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym>.
You could think of it as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRON_command">TRON</a>” as it actually shows you the execution of each statment that is abolutely amazing!
Imagine each line below being shown one at a time and you'll get a feeling for how this works.
We'll be following line 5 from the above program (assuming D is 1):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>D
D←
D←99
D←99-D
D←99-1
D←98
D←98+1
D←99
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>One more example,
to show that the Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> also follows mathematical precedence.
Here, A is 1, B is 2 and C is 3.
The line of code we're following is:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>D←A+B*C
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and during execution:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>D
D←
D←A
D←1
D←1+B
D←1+2
D←1+2*C
D←1+2*3
D←1+6
D←7
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Strange as it sounds,
this blew me away.
I don't think I've ever seen anything like this.
Sure,
in debuggers where you execute a line at a time.
Or in assembly language,
instruction by instruction.
But never substeps in expression evaluation.
And of course,
you can always step through the code with the “STEP” button.
I just find it amazing that all of this,
as simple as it is,
can fit in 4,096 bytes of code.</p>

<p>How it stores the code internally is interesting.
Most <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym>s I'm aware of store the line number as part of the program,
but here,
that's not done.
Take this program for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>1 A ← 1
2 HOR1 ← HOR1 + 1
3 A ← A + 5
4 GOTO 2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Internally in memory,
it's stored:</p>

<table>
  <caption>Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> program layout</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Byte</th><th>Symbol</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E8</td><td>←</td></tr>
    <tr><td>01</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>F1</td><td>&lt;end of line&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B2</td><td>HOR1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E8</td><td>←</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B2</td><td>HOR1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E3</td><td>+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>01</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>F1</td><td>&lt;end of line&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E8</td><td>←</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E3</td><td>+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>05</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>F1</td><td>&lt;end of line&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A6</td><td>GOTO</td></tr>
    <tr><td>02</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FF</td><td>&lt;end of program&gt;</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Not a line number in sight,
which means <code>GOTO</code> statements do a linear scan of the program
(a typical design choice of <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> systems on 8-bit computers at the time)
but the end of each line <em>is</em> marked.
Weird,
but whatever works I guess.</p>

<p>Variables are stored after the program, sequentially:</p>

<table>
  <caption>Atari 2600 <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> variable layout</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Byte</th><th>Symbol</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>B2</td><td>HOR1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>EE</td><td>is (see below)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>02</td><td>current value</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BC</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>EE</td><td>is</td></tr>
    <tr><td>15</td><td>current value</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As best as I can tell,
the value <code>EE</code> is used when displaying the variables on the “VARIABLES” window,
and probably means “is.”  It's probably done that way to avoid a special case when displaying data—it can be treated the same when displaying the program.
I'm guessing there's not much space left what with the font data and code to support the <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> in addition to running a
(admittedly very simple) <acronym title="Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</acronym> interpreter for special casing the variables.</p>

<p>As a “proof-of-concept” it's an amzing piece of work.
As an actual product,
yes,
it <em>sucks</em>,
mostly because of the limitations of the hardware.
The ideas behind it are incredible though,
and I think it's gotten short shrifted because of the limitations,
which is sad.
There is something to learn from here.</p>

<div>

<h4>Update Wednesday, June 17<sup>th</sup>, 2015 at 1:56 AM</h4>

<p>I almost forgot—the <code>IF</code> statement is an expression!
You can do the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>A ← IF B = 15 THEN 40 ELSE 99
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and <code>A</code> will be 40 if <code>B</code> is 15,
otherwise <code>A</code> will be 99.
There aren't many languages I've used that have allowed this.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Do you ever feel like you have no idea what you’re doing? Like you’re just kind of going along with things, doing your <em>best</em> but not really sure if you’re doing it <em>right</em>?</p><p>Here’s a little secret I’ve learned over the years: <em>Nobody knows what they’re doing.</em></p><p>Denis, with his steadfast approach and surgeon-like precision? Hannah, with her pen and notebook, who writes down every detail to later review? Kendall, who is quick on the trigger to any bizarre question that upper management tosses her way and always leaves them with good laughs and big smiles?</p><p>All of them? <em>They have no idea what they’re doing.</em> They don’t <strong>have</strong> to know what they’re doing. They’ve unlocked the biggest secret that formal education has desperately tried to unteach us: Failing is <em>fine</em>! Failing is <strong>good</strong>! Failing is <strong><em>the fastest way to success</em></strong>!</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/WJeSMrXAhgHYU4fZHfaaH/ef143f37f81945a4a0710040145433b3/1OL6dFH.gif" alt="slimemold"></p><p>Brainless, single-cell slime hunting for food.</p><p>In the world of software development, we’ve already accepted this as scientific fact. We embrace this and weave it into the foundation of our methodologies and systems. We know, with absolute certainty, that nothing is certain. The winner will be the little boat whose chart is scribbled on the back of a napkin and can pivot on a dime, not the monolithic Titanic who, despite the captain’s best efforts, is going to collide with that iceberg.</p><p>However, even though we recognize the advantages and the <em>need</em> to be <strong>agile</strong> in this industry, that does not mean that we’ve mastered all the ways to optimize this. While different Software Development methodologies can have their place for different problem spaces (just as different programming languages are better suited for some problems over others), one particular approach to <strong><em>failing fast</em></strong> has gained a lot of traction over the past decade. The <strong>DevOps</strong> methodology was forged from the fires of Agile, and today DevOps has been crowned the champion of how to build great software, quickly and wicked fast. Modern technology companies that thrive to compete place DevOps on the forefront of their mind.</p><h2 id="what-is-devops">What is DevOps?</h2><p>If you’re not already familiar with DevOps, the term can be a little confusing. DevOps began as a cultural movement within companies. Rather than Developer teams taking their code and throwing it over the fence for the Operations team to deploy and monitor (while the Security team haughtily throws their arms in the air over any concern—be it major or minor—introduced by the other teams), DevOps works to tear down these artificial walls.</p><p>The way this works in practice is through tight feedback loops and blurring the edges of responsibility. “DevOps” has turned from an idea into a career where you build a racetrack for product development. This enables the idea-to-deployment cycle to hasten. No longer do we need to take months to plan, build, test, release, deploy, evaluate. No longer do we need to make sure every release is perfect “because there’s no going back”. Now we can do what we do best: <em>Make mistakes.</em></p><p>You’ve heard of (or worked with) companies that deploy their code tens to thousands of times a day. This is incredibly powerful. Ideas always look a little different in practice and sometimes they turn out to be bad ideas. But sometimes those silly ideas that would have you laughed out of a boardroom turn out to be the ones worth their weight in gold. With the ability to experiment and quickly reset, we can fractal our way to the perfect solution for any problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/75VdZ4jr0QwzXgpU6gk6vW/fff263c59f6582aaf3fd60d72312ebfb/ComplexGargantuanFluke-size_restricted.gif" alt="ComplexGargantuanFluke"></p><p>Twining motion of vines trying to find something to climb.</p><h2 id="why-do-i-need-environments">Why do I need Environments?</h2><p>If your company is big enough, has the capital, and understands the need, you may be lucky enough to have a team of DevOps Engineers who work to help make sure everyone has the environments they need, and the tools to build and deploy code.You have your build and deploy pipelines. Your code only takes one push, merge, and a couple button clicks to make its way into production. You’re. Living. The. Life. </p><p>Okay, sure, there are rough edges. The Developers and QA might be a little agitated that they have “bad data” in their databases. This bad data causes weird shadow bugs that wouldn’t exist “for a real user”. You have Product Managers and UX/UI Engineers digging around your QA and Staging Environments to make sure the feature matches the requirements, but they run into these shadow bugs and in a panic, hold a meeting to discuss “why the application is broken”. </p><p><em>C’est la vie.</em> Your environments are starting to drift apart, but it’s okay. QA finds a bug, but they can’t be sure when it was introduced. The Developer isn’t sure either, there are a few features that others were working on that have all been merged into here. One major feature is ready, but the others are blocked. Hours tick into the evening as the team scrambles to fix the concerns, introducing more in their haste, until finally QA calls to cancel today’s deployment. Disappointed and mentally taxed, everyone finally goes home frustrated.</p><p>This happens regularly. It’s a clog in the system, but it is manageable. However, what you don’t know yet is that your competitor has committed to allocating resources to addressing this problem directly. It took them twelve months (a bit off from their original six-month estimate), but now the tooling is built out and QA can create a build from any branch, on the fly. Now the data is fresh, every time, freeing QA to get their hands dirty in this sandbox. The Product team is excited to be able to look at new features side by side before they’re released, and features can even be put on hold or tinkered with in isolation. </p><p>Meanwhile, your company is falling behind. The only way you’d be able to keep up is to spend the money <em>and the time</em> to build this for yourselves. It’s a big investment, a big time commitment, and your company is worried. What if the project fails? There’s a lot at stake here.</p><p>Environments are the key to rapid prototyping and quick feature releases, while maintaining a solid, battle-tested product. But environments are also expensive. The upfront and maintenance cost put them outside the scope for many companies and by the time a strong need rears its head, the architecture has evolved into a technical labyrinth. </p><p>At Release, we understand this problem in depth. We have customers who use Release to give themselves a competitive advantage after they realized environments were holding them back. A new concept in DevOps has emerged called <a href="https://releaseapp.io/ephemeral-environments" title="What is an Ephemeral Environment?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ephemeral Environments</a> which eliminates the bottleneck of shared staging environments.  An Ephemeral Environment is automatically created when a developer does a pull request and has just their changes on their branch. This environment spins up for UAT testing and when the branch is merged, it disappears. Developers never wait for access to environments as they appear as part of their development workflow.</p><p>We’re using Ephemeral Environments which has put us on fast-track to shipping deliverables that we can stand behind. The unfortunate truth is that building this infrastructure is necessary to have a fighting chance against the heavyweights. But the problem is that the cost and time required can be astronomical. The <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" title="Release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Release</a> platform specifically aims to solve this problem directly by providing Environments-as-a-Service. This way, you get all the advantages of environments, without the costs or headache of Doing It Yourself, freeing you up to focus on the business and the product needs. </p><h2 id="in-short">In short…</h2><p>Remember: Nobody knows what they’re doing. And that’s okay. Nobody’s ever known what they’re doing; we’re all just stumbling around. But if we stumble with purpose, we can fall into something that works. If we fail fast, we get to success faster. Our methodologies in software development reflect this, but in practice, building supportive infrastructure is costly. If we can get to a place where we optimtimize failing fast by deploying early and often, we can more quickly find what our product needs to be. We can find success <em>without ever having to know</em> what we’re doing.</p><h2 id="ephemeral-environments">Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>Curious about Ephemeral Environments and what they can do for you? Check out <a href="https://releaseapp.io/ephemeral-environments" title="What is an Ephemeral Environment?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this article</a> on what Ephemeral Environments are and what they can do for you. </p></div></article></div>]]>

    <div>
            <div>
        
<p><span>This page will be an ever-evolving log of my backyard shedquarters. The last update was January 4th.</span></p>
<p>During 2020 I began working full-time from home in our 2 bedroom house. I completely took over the kitchen table
for a while because I thought the pandemic would only last a few weeks, which was adorable in hindsight. After a
couple of months I moved to the spare bedroom and set up shop in there. Our company has since decided to go
fully remote forever, so I needed a more dedicated space for working</p>
<p>Oh, also... my wife and I are expecting triplets sometime in the Spring of 2021!</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/triplets.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/triplets.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>So clearly our 2 bedroom is going to be tight with our soon-to-be family of FIVE.</p>
<p>I've always wanted a shedquarters because it seems so fun to build out the perfect workspace, so I decided to
pull the trigger on it sometime in October.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along on Twitter, here's the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About a month ago, I got a 10x20 shed
        delivered so I could build out a shedquarters office in my backyard. It's been a ton of fun (and
        work) so far! I'm going to share a lot of it on this thread over the next couple of months until it's
        done. (Also at <a href="https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk">https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk</a>.)

    (@aarondfrancis) <a href="https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis/status/1333866090573811723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December
        1, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h2>Build vs Buy</h2>
<p>The first question I had to answer was whether I was going to try to build a shed from the ground up, or buy a
pre-made one. Having never built anything before I thought it might be fun to try something relatively
low-stakes like a shed. I watched a ton of YouTube videos and felt pretty confident I could pull <em>something</em>
off.</p>
<p>However, in the end I decided that it would take <em>way</em> longer than I wanted to build it from the ground up, and
I have a lot of other projects that would suffer if I spent 3 months building a shed. I am so, so glad I decided
to buy a pre-made shell instead.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Builder</h2>
<p>There are lots of fancy options that come totally pre-done and look beautiful (<a href="http://kangaroomsystems.com/">Kanga
Rooms</a> being one of them). Those were way too expensive for my budget, and didn't
leave me quite enough room for customizing to my liking.</p>
<p>Those fancier options are really geared toward "turn-key home offices", while what I wanted was more of "a shed
I can turn into an office".</p>
<p>There are a shed load (get it) of shed manufacturers to choose from, at least here in Texas! The one I settled
on was <a href="https://www.lonestarstructures.com/">Lone Star Structures</a>. Their prices are great, their customer
service is amazing, and they have an online shed designer that lets you build out exactly what you're looking
for. They also delivered and leveled it for me, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from my 3D design:</p>

<h2>Building Size</h2>
<p>I decided to go with a 10x20 building, for two reasons. The first is that we only have about 10 feet of space in
the spot where the shed was going to go, so that limited the width. The second reason is that anything &lt;= 200
square feet does not require a permit.</p>
<p>We had an old shed that was 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, you can see how tight the width is:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/old-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The only access to our backyard is through a large gate that is just over 11ft wide.</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/gate.jpg"></p><p>I have some pictures and videos of the delivery, you'll see just how tight it was even with the 10ft model.</p>
<h2>Floor Plan</h2>
<p>We don't have a garage, so that old shed was serving the purpose of storing "garage stuff", which the new
building would have to do as well. To accomodate both the needs of a new office and "garage stuff", I decided to
split the shed into two sections. A 10x16 space for the office, and a 10x4 space for the garage stuff.</p>
<p>Lone Star Structures has the option to add a 4 foot "loft" in their configuration tool, so I added the loft and
then specifically requested that they build out a wall underneath.</p>
<p>Here's a floor plan overview:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here's what it looks like in real life:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/loft.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/loft.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The large, double doors open from the yard into the storage area. You can see the stud wall Lone Star built for
me to partition the space. Eventually there will be a proper wall there and the two spaces will be totally
discrete.</p>
<p>Here's a shot from the inside looking out. You can see the "loft" that will be accessible from the office and
give me a bit more air conditioned storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/pano.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/pano.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The astute reader will now note that when the wall is completed... there will be no way to get into the office!
More on that soon.</p>
<h2>Demolition of the Old Shed</h2>
<p>Before the new shed came, I had to get rid of the old one. I tried for a week or two to <em>give it away</em> on
Craigslist, but that failed hysterically. A couple of people asked if it would fit in their SUV. It's a 10x12
shed that weighs hundreds of pounds!</p>
<p>After being disappointed by Craigslist once again, I decided to borrow a sawzall and demolish it myself. It was
a lot of hard work, but this timelapse makes it look super easy:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxhCjshVRvU?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Preparing the Pad for the New Shed</h2>
<p>Since the new shed is 8 feet longer than the old shed was, I needed to make the pad 8 feet longer. Lone Star was
responsible for leveling the shed (which they did a great job of), I just had to provide a pad that was within
12 inches (!) of level.</p>
<p>The old pad was a few inches lower than the surrounding ground, so I wanted it to be a little more uniform.</p>
<p>I started by tilling the ground and then used the broad side of a pick axe to break it up more. I repeated that
process for... ever. Tilling, axing, raking, over and over.</p>
<p>After I got it all level enough, I wanted to compact it down. Since I didn't have a tamper and didn't want to
spend 40 bucks on one I'll never use again, my genius neighbor and I made a pretty janky makeshift tamper out of
a sledgehammer and some boards. It mostly kind of worked!</p>
<p>It also looks hysterical and insane.</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/tamper.jpg"></p><p>Turns out the best tamper is not a sledgehammer attached to some boards, but rather an SUV. Maybe my best idea
so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Again, the timelapse make it look super easy, but it was a lot of work. Please validate me!</p>

<h2>Delivery Day</h2>
<p>The day the shed was delivered I was nervously just waiting around for them to show up. We live on a quiet
residential street that is not super wide, so I was a bit worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down the
street. I was also worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down our driveway, which is also not very wide.</p>
<p>Then a full on 18-wheeler turned the corner and I thought to myself</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/mistake.gif"></p><p>Not only did he have my shed on there, he had another one too! Like it was no big deal!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-bHsgYG2KM?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the face of a concerned person whose neighbors are coming outside to see what the ruckus is.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/concerned.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/concerned.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here I am talking to him trying to figure out just exactly what the plan is here, as if I could help.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the guy that does this for a living (not me) was less concerned than the average software
developer (me), and apparently it <em>was</em> no big deal because he just tipped the magic trailer back and plopped it
in the street like a boss.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The guy (Joe) that drove the shed down the driveway and positioned in place was a wizard with his tiny little
forklift. I have no idea how he did it, because we had only inches to spare.</p>
<p>I'm so pumped for my new shed that I pre-emptively celebrate with a Diet Coke while Joe is toiling away
somewhere actually getting stuff done.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/celebrating.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/celebrating.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I did have to cut trees back in a few places on both sides of the driveway, so I wasn't <em>totally</em> useless.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/trees.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/trees.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here's the whole 1-2 hour process nice and sped up.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKfLARMYZ_o?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once it was in place, Joe spent another 30 or 45 minutes getting it all level.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/leveling.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/leveling.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And now I have a shed! Monster is concerned that it may be too much house for him to handle, I haven't broken
the news that it's not actually for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/monster-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/monster-1.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>Adding a French Door</h2>
<p>Because I'm going to be having two separate partitions in the building with a wall in between, I'll need a way
to access the office. The doors that are already present on the shed access the tool/yard storage area.</p>
<p>When I was designing the shed I had the option to add a door and some windows using their online design tool,
but everything they offer is geared towards sheds because... they build sheds. I wanted something that looked
a little nicer since this is going to be my office and take up a large portion of our yard.</p>
<p>One of my friends recommended that I put in french doors that can serve both as an access point and let in a ton
of light. I found a good <a href="http://www.craddocklumber.com/">local lumber company</a> that I bought the door from. I
was able to customize it so that it swings <em>out</em> instead of in, because there isn't a ton of room for an
in-swinging door in the office.</p>
<p>They also delivered it for me. Turns out it's very very heavy. And beautiful!</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg"></a></p>
<p>For this part of the project I recruited my Dad and my brother-in-law because I knew it was going to be a tough
one to do solo.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-team.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-team.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We started by clearing the studs out of the section that the door was going to fit in. The placement was figured
so that I have enough room to put my desk in one corner without it overlapping into the door. We used a combo of
sledgehammer + prybar to get the studs out.</p>
<p>Note that this shed is so small (and has the loft wall), that there is
basically no load carried by this wall, so we could just knock the studs out without worrying. We did of course
frame the door in, but there's just so little to worry about in this regard because of the size of the building.</p>
<p>If you do something like this, don't listen to some guy on the internet, ask someone who actually knows what
they're doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-placement.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-placement.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Once we got it framed up, we took a sawzall and just started cutting it out! There's no going back from this
point, which was very scary.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/49ee8650-596d-4471-9de9-eb2e3a220813/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg"></a></p>
<p>With the wall gone, it was time to dry fit the door and start getting it installed. This was the first time any
of us had ever installed a french door, so I was pleased that we got it pretty close! I think the rough
opening was bigger than it needed to be, but we added an extra 2x4 and lots …</p></div></div></div></div>

It was launched in 1965, stopped working after just 43 days, and has had <em>seven</em> “anomalous events” that caused nearly 50 trackable pieces of debris to be shed from the craft. It should stay in orbit for 3,000 years… unless it breaks up further. The other ~30 known fission reactors were launched in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-A" target="_blank">Soviet RORSATs</a>: nuclear-powered LEO ocean-surveillance radar satellites that required periodic boosts to prevent reentry. They were designed to launch their <sup>235</sup>U reactors to a higher orbit at the end of their operational lives. (These orbits will last 300-1,000 years, but the reactor fuel has a half-life of 70,000 years… so future generations may not love the plan.) But, these boosts didn’t always happen: in 1978, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954" target="_blank">Cosmos 954 RORSAT</a> malfunctioned, reentered, and broke apart over northern Canada with the reactor attached, scattering radioactive debris over an 800 km long path—the USSR eventually paid $3M for cleanup, about a fifth of the true cost. Other satellites have also broken up in orbit, spreading radioactive debris, like the US’s Transit 5BN3 (carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power#SNAP-9" target="_blank">SNAP RTG</a>) and the USSR’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1402" target="_blank">Cosmos 1402 RORSAT</a>. Others, including the higher power and higher orbit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1818" target="_blank">Kosmos 1818</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1867" target="_blank">Kosmos 1867</a> RORSATs, have leaked trails of radioactive NaK coolant. The usefulness of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on NASA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Maximum_Mission" target="_blank">SolarMax</a> mission was reduced by <a href="http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/RORSAT/RORSAT.html#Kosmos-1867" target="_blank">anomalous gamma ray emissions from these leaking higher-orbit reactors</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>It’s 2am. You finally have a Lambda function running in a VPC. And all it took was 40 Terraform <code>resource</code> blocks and 8 hours of your life. You breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that you are the embodiment of DevOps.</p><p>The next day, after getting a good night of sleep, you realize that maybe your <code>hello-world-test</code> Lambda function isn’t as unique as you thought it was, and maybe somebody else has created a Terraform module that could have saved you a few hours with a more production-ready result.</p><p>One year later, you look back fondly on your days of not knowing what the heck you were doing, as you now publish new Lambda functions in minutes with a trusty Terraform module. But is this module something you wrote, or is it open-source? And what difference does that make?</p><p>This post makes an argument that you should try to use open-source Terraform modules when you can, and that you’re likely able to much more often than you might think.</p><p>At Transcend, we use open-source Terraform modules as much as we can to ensure we are always building our software on secure, tested infrastructure, built with best practices. While we still have a few small private modules that we use internally, over 60% of our over 500 used modules are open-source.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-terraform-module">What is a Terraform module?</h2><p><a href="https://terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Terraform</a> has taken over as a dominant force in the infrastructure-as-code world. It’s easy to get started with, open-sourced, and is incredibly powerful across dozens of cloud providers.</p><p>Terraform lets you create <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">resource blocks</a> that define a cloud resource, such as a server, IAM user, or database. As an extension, you can also group resources together into reusable <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">modules</a>.</p><p>To use a module, you create a new block in any terraform file and specify the block type as <code>module</code>, and point the <code>source</code> field to any module on <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the open-source registry</a>.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>module</span><span> "vault" </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>source</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"hashicorp/vault/aws"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>version</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"0.14.0"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>In this example, the module points to the v0.14.0 version of <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/vault/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hashicorp’s official Vault module</a>. Pinning to a specific version is crucial with external modules, as it allows you to pin to a specific point in time.</p><p>I like to think of modules as a function. The <code>source</code> is the name of the function you want to call. The <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">variables you pass in</a> are the parameters, and the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">output blocks it defines</a> are the function result. The function body is updating cloud resources to match your defined <code>resource</code> configuration.</p><h2 id="arguments-for-using-open-source-modules">Arguments for using open-source modules</h2><p>While coding your own Terraform modules is tempting for those that like to get in the weeds and learn, there are some key reasons why leveraging existing open-source work is beneficial in the long run.</p><h3 id="1-major-components-of-your-infrastructure-are-not-unique">1. Major components of your infrastructure are not unique</h3><p>If each company could just copy-paste each others’ infrastructure and we could all have well-secured, easily maintainable, highly performant infrastructure at the press of a button, we wouldn’t need DevOps or Operations engineers. In the real world, things aren’t that easy as each company has its own requirements.</p><p>But even so, we often choose to rely on the same underlying technologies. Depending on your requirements, you might choose to deploy some apps directly onto servers like an EC2, or maybe you will containerize your app and deploy it to ECS or a Kubernetes cluster, or maybe your app works best on a serverless platform like Lambda. And in each of these cases, you still have many options to customize exactly how you want your infrastructure.</p><p>With nearly infinite different ways you can deploy and secure your applications, it may seem like using pre-built modules won’t work for your exact use case. But by accepting that you’ll still likely use services like VPCs, Lambda, Autoscaling groups, ECS/EKS, etc, we must admit that the level of “pre-built”-ness we need exists on a spectrum.</p><p>You wouldn’t use “we’re all unique” as justification for not using Terraform, or for not using Kubernetes, so we need to carefully evaluate if that argument applies for Terraform modules. And that leads us to…</p><h3 id="2-certain-open-source-modules-are-highly-reusable">2. Certain open-source modules are highly reusable</h3><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/a91P4mjYrtJM2FIOrAnv4/a1ae4616ec44b056e928a743656090f9/xavi-cabrera-kn-UmDZQDjM-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of Lego blocks."></p><figcaption>Use (and re-use) building blocks. (photo by Xavi Cabrera on Unsplash).</figcaption></div><p>Maybe you don’t want a single “web-app” module like <a href="https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this one</a> that manages all of your infrastructure for an app for you. For new applications, it might be a good option, but maybe you don’t want your logs going to CloudWatch, as you use something else. Maybe you want to use Kubernetes because you have an existing cluster. Maybe you have an existing CI/CD pipeline and don’t want to use Codepipeline.  Maybe you want to use Istio for service registration instead of AWS App Mesh.</p><p>But the all-in approach is just one end of the spectrum, and the other is not using modules at all, and just defining each resource you need in a tedious manner that could end up with hundreds/thousands of lines of code required per application.</p><p>At Transcend, we’ve found the happy medium of using modules that aim to handle all resources within a specific AWS service (or sometimes a small handful). This means that we don’t search for full web-app solutions, but for modules related to <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VPCs</a>, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lambda</a>, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IAM</a>, etc.</p><p>As an example, here is a usage of the VPC module from terraform-aws-modules:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>module</span><span> vpc </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>source</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>version</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"v2.62.0"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span>            </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"demo-vpc"</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>cidr</span><span>            </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"10.0.0.0/16"</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>azs</span><span>             </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"eu-west-1a"</span><span>, </span><span>"eu-west-1b"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>public_subnets</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"10.0.1.0/24"</span><span>, </span><span>"10.0.2.0/24"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>private_subnets</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"10.0.11.0/24"</span><span>, </span><span>"10.0.12.0/24"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>enable_nat_gateway</span><span>     </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>single_nat_gateway</span><span>     </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>one_nat_gateway_per_az</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>enable_flow_log</span><span>                      </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_log_group</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  </span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_iam_role</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>  </span><span>flow_log_max_aggregation_interval</span><span>    </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>If you are familiar with VPCs on AWS, this likely reads fairly easily regardless of if you’ve seen this module before. It creates a private cloud named <code>demo-vpc</code> that has public and private subnets in the <code>eu-west-1</code> region. The private subnets will have external internet access through a NAT gateway that is shared across AZs to save money. All network traffic will be logged to a new Flow Logs log group.</p><p>This short module declaration creates 25 unique resources in the AWS cloud and is highly customizable. Not only is it far quicker to write this module than it is to write out all 25 resources manually, but it is far less error-prone.</p><h3 id="3-open-source-modules-save-time">3. Open-source modules save time</h3><p>An excellent example of a module that makes use of other open-source modules is the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-awms-atlantis/blob/master/main.tf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">terraform-aws-atlantis</a> module used to create a CI/CD pipeline for your infrastructure code.</p><p>It creates a VPC, load balancer, ACM certificate, security groups, and an ECS service all using open-source modules. That likely made writing and maintaining that module much easier than using all custom resources, but the composition of all of those modules is what makes for the biggest time saver of all: You can directly use their pre-built solution if you want to, while also <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-atlantis/blob/master/variables.tf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">customizing it extensively</a>.</p><p>For larger applications like Atlantis, Hashicorp Vault, or Transcend Sombra, the initial setup can be daunting. But the Terraform community made a reusable <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/atlantis/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">module for creating Atlantis clusters</a>, Hashicorp paid <a href="https://gruntwork.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gruntwork</a> to create <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/vault/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a secure implementation of Vault</a>, and at Transcend we created a module for <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/transcend-io/sombra/aws/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our Sombra service</a> that can be self-hosted if our customers want complete control over the encryption of their data.</p><p>In particular I love the Hashicorp Vault module, as it let us scaffold up a working Vault cluster in a day or two, and we can be highly confident in the security of our cluster. For a server that’s main job is to hold our most sensitive secrets, that is a massive confidence boost.</p><p>When Vault came out with support for DynamoDb as a storage backend for secrets, we were immediately interested due to the global redundancy and high availability offered by Dynamo. Within a few weeks, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/releases/tag/v0.13.6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the Vault module was updated to support the new backend</a>, and migrating was easy.</p><p>If we had written our own Vault module, we would have had to change over the backend configuration ourselves, instead of just changing what flags/variables we passed to the module.</p><h3 id="4-open-source-modules-are-highly-configurable">4. Open-source modules are highly configurable</h3><p>In the above example, you’ll notice that we enabled <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VPC Flow Logs</a>. At one point, we were having some troubles with one of our VPC’s security groups and weren’t sure why some traffic wasn’t hitting it’s endpoint.</p><p>After researching flow logs and recognizing that they could help us debug, we added… </p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>enable_flow_log</span><span>                      </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_log_group</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>create_flow_log_cloudwatch_iam_role</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></p></pre></div><p>…to our module, which handles creating a log group, giving the VPC access via a new IAM Role to publish the logs, and configures the VPC to write out Flow Logs to that log group.</p><p>These three lines create five <code>resources</code> in Terraform per VPC, and with dozens of VPCs throughout Transcend, it was wonderful to already have this functionality built into the modules before we needed it. A single PR with a small diff added Flow Logs support to all of our VPCs, all without needing to look up any documentation on specific resources.</p><p>The high amount of customization many open-source modules offer makes them great for production-readiness. Instead of searching for one module that does everything, you can compose the smaller modules to quickly scaffold almost any infrastructure you want.</p><h3 id="5-open-source-modules-are-easy-to-make-more-configurable">5. Open-source modules are easy to make more configurable</h3><p>Whether you use open-source modules or homemade, you’ll likely want to add features to the module at some point.</p><p>As an example, at Transcend we were using a <a href="https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cloudposse module</a> to manage our frontend CloudFront distributions.

<p>Have you wondered what makes people ruder or meaner on the internet? Why do people resort to aggressive remarks, harshly criticize opinions, and fight over comments? Or so freely share sensitive traumatic experiences on forums? Why do people do things on the internet that they wouldn’t do offline? The answers lie in the online disinhibition effect. </p>












<h2><span id="What_is_the_Online_Disinhibition_Effect">What is the Online Disinhibition Effect?</span></h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1094931041291295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">The online disinhibition effect</a></strong> (ODE) occurs when we fail to regulate our impulses, feel less restrained, and feel more open to self-expression because of the anonymity and distance the internet provides. Online personas are different from real-world personas because the internet offers anonymity and psychological distance that allows us to lower our filters, increase impulsivity and aggression, and drop inhibitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The online disinhibition effect essentially explains the difference between our material-world behavior &amp; internet behavior.</p>



<p><a href="https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/4335/3402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">People tend to self-disclose</a>&nbsp;and express more because of perceived invisibility. The lack of real-life feedback (eye contact, physical presence), the shrugging of responsibility, the invisibility, the digital mask &amp; shield, and the ability to trivialize consequences can make people do things they wouldn’t normally do in the offline world. Actions can’t always be traced back to a specific someone in material life. These factors also make it easy for us to share things with strangers <em>because they unknown strangers</em>. </p>



<p>ODE is why people become keyboard warriors or become mean and rude when they have a digital mask on. The anonymity or digital cloaks we put on, much like the invisibility cloak from harry potter, makes it easier for us to magnify our emotions. We believe we can get away without facing the consequences of our actions, shift blame, or easily disown our actions because it is harder to verify who did what. In extreme cases, the mentality is “if no one knows who I am, I don’t need to care about what I do.”</p>








<h3><span id="Benign_vs_Toxic_ODE">Benign vs. Toxic ODE</span></h3>



<p>The ODE has positive consequences like easier <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934215.2019.1607516" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">self-expression</a> and negative consequences like <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2955129.2955138" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">cyberbullying</a>. The negative effects of online disinhibition like hate-speech are often called <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ITP-07-2015-0167/full/html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">toxic disinhibition</a>. Sometimes it simply affects how people reveal themselves online (called benign ODE). For example, <a href="https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/4335" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">one study</a> found that invisibility, lack of eye-contact, and anonymity promote the usage of First-person words like “I” in revealing details about oneself.</p>



<p>With the online and offline lives being different from one another, relationships and marriages have an additional problem – emotional cheating via the internet. <a href="https://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=07334273&amp;AN=137901535&amp;h=b7Nzp7%2bWRpJSCdS0ER3eKgZZzdWCi9%2fbOtA09LFTt7glBOII%2fVGey55x6xrWz4mo1%2bPeJqW0TLfX1DaYklZ3nw%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d07334273%26AN%3d137901535" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Research suggests</a> that online disinhibition explains a slowly growing attachment to another person via the internet, creating detachment or unrest between an existing relationship. Emotionally cheating partners could deny and disown their online behavior that facilitates emotional cheating. They may unconsciously justify it as communicating with someone else within their own private cyber-mental space.</p>



<p>Our social media behavior is both <a href="https://cognitiontoday.com/effect-of-social-media-on-mental-health-well-being/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">active &amp; passive</a>, and the ODE can affect both forms of behavior. We may passively engage in consuming content that we would feel bad about in real-life or actively voice an opinion we are too scared to disclose at a family dinner.</p>








<h2><span id="What_causes_the_online_disinhibition_effect">What causes the online disinhibition effect? </span></h2>



<p>Researchers have identified at least <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1094931041291295" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">6 factors</a> that create ODE. Studies suggest that online behavior &amp; identity are not true reflections of character. Online identity is a different “constellation” of traits &amp; behaviors that are just different from offline identity. Neither is one’s true or original self. Both realities – online &amp; offline create different versions of the self.</p>







<h3><span id="1_Dissociative_anonymity">1. Dissociative anonymity</span></h3>



<p>It is not always easy to identify a person through identity cues on the internet. People tend to obscure them or hide them. When people go online with a significant amount of anonymity, they dissociate from their real identity, making them feel less vulnerable. That discourages self-guarding behavior and encourages self-disclosing behavior. People’s online identity becomes a compartmentalized version of the self, removed from material reality. Once dissociated from reality, related morals, ethics, and norms change too. It is easier for people to shrug responsibility for negative actions and not accept publically verifiable responsibility by denying actions, using smoke-screens, or playing the blame-game. You never know who is sus &amp; faking tasks. </p>








<h3><span id="2_Invisibility">2. Invisibility</span></h3>



<p>When dealing with just a username and text-based content like comments, posts, and surveys, there is perceived psychological &amp; physical invisibility due to the lack of eye contact, facial expressions, body language, movement, etc. People feel gutsy, less scared, and more motivated to take risks because of that. They are less worried about how others might judge or perceive them. They feel less anxious about sharing intimate details that cause negative emotions, such as embarrassing stories, trauma, or confessions. This invisibility is one of the main reasons people create safe spaces to share their thoughts and experiences. The value of invisibility is so high in some communities that explicit rules prevent doxxing, which is the act of publishing details of someone’s identity that connects an internet message to an identifiable real person.</p>







<h3><span id="3_Asynchronicity">3. Asynchronicity</span></h3>



<p>Online communication occurs asynchronously, which means they take place with unpredictable gaps between 2 interactions. We can reply to an email in 10 days or have a real-time WhatsApp conversation that suddenly pauses for 7 hours. When we don’t wish to continue a conversation immediately, it can disinhibit us because it disconnects us from a conversational feedback loop. A continuous flowing conversation has many elements coming from multiple people that guide the conversation. The flow promotes certain conversational elements and discourages some elements. Asynchronous disconnection kills the feedback loop and prevents a natural response to an earlier message.</p>







<h3><span id="4_Solipsistic_introjection">4. Solipsistic introjection</span></h3>



<p>The lack of face-to-face cues and real-time feedback between people can lead to fuzzy self-boundaries. In some sense, other people on the internet become a part of one’s shared mind via the internet. Their thoughts feel like your own thoughts (this is called introjection), which occur within the shared cyberspace. Other’s minds feel like a part of your mind when we introject. People have aggressive or harsher thoughts within the confines of their mental space, which is separate from the outside world. Similarly, aggressive thoughts in the form of comments can be introjected and expressed within the confines of cyberspace, which has merged with one’s own psyche.</p>








<h3><span id="5_Dissociative_imagination">5. Dissociative imagination</span></h3>



<p>One way to look at going online is escaping from reality, where people get to create their own new, modified versions. This imagined self that one portrays over the internet is disconnected from the physical self. This version of the self can evolve differently from the biological self. It could adopt new behaviors that follow a different set of rules. The motivation to create that identity could be unmet psychological needs that amplify one’s self-worth &amp; assertiveness, or fantasies and wishes that allow bold behaviors because they seem attractive. Dissociative imagination could be a coping mechanism.</p>








<h3><span id="6_Minimization_of_authority">6. Minimization of authority</span></h3>



<p>On the internet, status &amp; social classes are ambiguous and social hierarchies based on age, experience, respect, fame, expertise, etc., mean little (in most contexts) unless they are particularly relevant to an online post. At most places on the internet, people have an equal opportunity to share what they want to share. Many times, such sharing is limited to particular social classes in the material world. And, authority figures can’t effectively use their authority to exert dominance the same way they can in the material life using body language, clothing, voice, etc. The minimized effects of authority and status encourage people to voice their thoughts freely in ways they like; sometimes, in a crass, rebellious way; sometimes, in a judgment-free way. It helps the disadvantaged and stereotyped people express freely, without worrying about their hurdles in real-life.</p>







<p>Another way to look at online disinhibition is to assess it from a psychological distance point of view. <a href="https://cognitiontoday.com/creative-cognition-construal-level-theory-psychological-distance/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">Among other things</a>, one important aspect of psychological distance is how it <a href="https://cognitiontoday.com/third-person-self-talk-is-an-effective-way-to-reduce-anxiety-and-regulate-emotions-applying-the-construal-level-theory/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">affects the intensity of emotions</a>. Increasing psychological distance makes it easier to digest stronger emotions. This has 2 effects. </p>



<ol><li>People are likely to create emotionally loaded messages thinking the distance will dilute them. </li><li>People are likely to trivialize harsher messages on the internet because the distance makes it easier to digest.</li></ol>








<h2><span id="Does_the_ODE_always_occur">Does the ODE always occur?</span></h2>



<p>It seems intuitive that all of us are permanently experiencing online disinhibition at various levels based on what we do on the internet. However, research shows that sometimes the exact opposite occurs – online anonymity reduces our tendency to overshare or act emotionally. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/18/3/283/4067498" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">In one study</a>, researchers analyzed 154 personal blogs and found that those who share their own image in the blog post tend to disclose more about their thoughts. They concluded that anonymity was linked to lesser (not more) self-disclosure; not as expected because of ODE. However, this is not completely in contrast with ODE because there is a fair chance that some people have different motivations for online behavior. Motivation to fully express oneself could include sharing photos as well as opinions where feeling “exposed” (that could restrict expression) on the internet isn’t seen as a problem.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is the most underrated generational shift in the world.</p><p>It saves everyone one hour per day in commute. It creates the biggest labor market in the world — a city in the cloud with hundreds of millions of people. It unlocks opportunity for everyone, regardless of where they live. It gives people more flexibility in working hours. The list goes on and on.</p><p>Remote work would be an unqualified panacea, if it wasn’t for one downside: it makes it harder to work together.</p><p>There’s less alignment than before. Conversations that used to take half an hour now stretch over days filled with Zoom meetings. And most importantly — work is less <em>fun</em> than it used to be. There’s less camaraderie, as it’s become harder to build culture and relationships between coworkers.</p><p>That’s certainly borne by the data. Buffer’s survey of 3,500 remote workers found that the two biggest struggles of remote workers are loneliness and “collaboration and communication.” And that was <em>before</em> the pandemic.</p><figure id="w-node-791ec061a5f0-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff4ffaaacc8fb2ac2c890bc_Biggest%20Struggle.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Beers on Friday evenings have been replaced by awkward “Zoom happy hours.” It’s become harder to build culture and camaraderie — the friction to jump onto a call is high enough to kill 90% of the chats that would have happened in the office.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-529857530ec2-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff5111a5c10c36583323985_Graph.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Taken individually, none of these interactions are very important. They’re of the “how’s it going?” variety. But collectively, they’re what culture is made of.</p><p>Ignoring the problem can be tempting. Work is still happening, after all. But it would be hard to overstate how important this issue actually is. There’s a reason why management books emphasize culture and team bonding so much — few things are more important, since everything else depends on this. In Brian Chesky’s words, “<a href="https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4">Don’t fuck up the culture.</a>”</p><p>This too is supported by the data. <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams">An MIT study of 2,500 white-collar workers</a> found that: (emphasis mine)</p><blockquote><em>“</em><strong><em>35% of the variation in a team’s performance can be accounted for simply by the number of face-to-face exchanges among team members.</em></strong><em> [… T]he least valuable forms of communication are e-mail and texting.”</em></blockquote><h3>Virtual offices: how to have our cake and eat it too<br></h3><p>Fortunately, we think there is a way to have our cake and eat it too — to have all the upside of remote, and none of the downside.</p><p><strong>We believe we can make collaboration software that’s so powerful that remote work becomes not only as good, but significantly better than being in the office.</strong></p><p>We’ve called it Teamflow.</p><p>Teamflow is a virtual office for remote teams. It recreates the casual, unplanned chats and the seamless collaboration that people miss from physical offices.</p><p>Here’s how it works: you see your video in a bubble on a virtual floor plan. You can move that bubble around, and only hear people around you. That means that, to chat with someone, you just drag your bubble over, and start talking.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff5138f5508e8986a0174eb_teamflow-steps.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-3944ae63fcff-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff4f7229abf13808ad3c99d_Steps.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We’ve been running Teamflow in private beta for the last six months, and were blown away by the response.

<div id="Waitlist-signup"><h3>Sign up to get access to Teamflow</h3>
<div><p>Thanks for signing up. We'll be in touch soon.</p></div><div><p>Oops! Something went wrong while signing up.</p></div></div></div><h3>Spatial Interface</h3><p><a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">John Palmer’s essay on spatial interfaces</a> is what inspired us to make space core to Teamflow.</p><p>In short, space comes intuitively to people. We had to become experts at it for our very survival — our sensorimotor skills are so good that roboticists talk of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">Moravec’s Paradox</a>” to designate the fact that AI was kicking our world champions’ butts at chess as early as in the 90s, but it still can’t do things like driving, which any teenager can learn.</p><p>We were skeptical at first, but after more than 50,000 hours of meetings on Teamflow, we’ve seen spatiality deliver on its promise.</p><p>One of our customers’ new hires told me that it’s only when they started using Teamflow, a full 4 weeks after he onboarded, that he met some of his coworkers for the first time — and that’s with a company of only 25 people.</p><p>This is hardly a unique experience — people underestimate how jarring it can be to start a new job at a remote company. On their first day at work, nobody is going to click on a list of names on Slack just to introduce themselves. But when you see your coworkers’ face in the same space as you, it feels natural to drag yourself over and say hi.<br></p><h3>Integrated Apps</h3><p>The real job-to-be-done of videoconferencing tool is to help people work together — and collaboration is much more than communication. So we think it’s only natural that you’d be able to open your work tools right where your meeting is happening.<br></p><p>Teamflow lets you open apps in the space. For now, these include:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>A scratchpad</li><li>A whiteboard</li><li>A countdown timer</li><li>A universal embed app, letting you open links to your applications like Trello, Figma or Google Docs</li></ul><p>Now, don’t tell anyone, but that’s kind of our world domination plan right there. We aim to be the “meta-coordination layer” that Kevin Kwok wrote about in <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">The Arc of Collaboration</a>:<br></p><blockquote><em>There is a need for a layer across all the applications. A layer for things that should be shared across the apps as well collaborative functionality across them. There is some mix of presence, collaboration, coordination, and identity that should be ubiquitous across whatever apps are being used. A layer more attached to the people doing work and what they’re trying to accomplish—than which specific app they’re in.</em><br></blockquote><p>We believe that opening all your apps in the same space as your meeting is a much more natural way of working, eliminating what we call “Cmd + Tab fatigue.”<br></p><p>It’s a more natural way of sharing, too. No more “okay, hold on one sec, I’m paaaastiiiing the link here in the chat… Can everybody see it?” You just open the link in the space, and everyone sees it immediately.<br></p><p>Finally, it’s a more natural way of collaborating. The default way people collaborate with Zoom is by screensharing, something we view as fundamentally uncollaborative — not only can only one person screenshare at a time, they’re also the only ones who can drive. It instantly makes a meeting feel like someone is speaking <em>at</em> you. This stands in contrast with Teamflow apps, which everyone can use at the same time, making for more engaging meetings.</p><figure id="w-node-be233c7bbe62-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5ff4f82741be0c3b2aa5d5f8_Illo-Persistence.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><div>

Imagine if you couldn’t keep anything on your desk, or put anything on the walls of your office. Humans are territorial animals — we need a space to call our own.<br></p><p>At the office, when a deadline looms for an important project, it’s common to set up a “war room” — a space dedicated to the project. These war rooms are very effective — the only reason we don’t use them more often is that space is so scarce.</p><p>So it’s ironic that we’re now given a medium with <em>unlimited space</em>, and instead of taking advantage of it, we limit it <em>even more</em> than what we had previously. We could have infinite war rooms — but instead, we get zero of them.</p><figure id="w-node-937b8f368b56-0b21c108"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fe12e458f19d935f547424f/5fe52df1d588368cdb032da6_image3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>This could be us but you playing</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Teamflow takes advantage of this infinite real estate. It lets you create one room for each of your projects, and the apps you open in that room persist: they’ll still be there when you come back. Imagine your Google Docs meeting notes, your Figma design, your project’s metrics dashboard — all together in one place.</p><p>This turns the current collaboration paradigm on its head. The way our tools work today is very app-centric. But the way we think about work is <em>project</em>-centric. Google Docs, Trello, or Jira don’t matter — the projects they enable do.</p><p>These three pillars — the spatial interface, integrated apps, and persistent rooms — form a cohesive whole. Apps live in the space, and persist. And together, we think they can make remote work better than being in the office.</p><h3>Making remote better than being in the office</h3><p>It may sound like a lofty goal, but it needs not be. It’s not like the quality of in-office work was a physical constant, the speed of light of collaboration.</p><p>In fact, there are many ways in which the physical world stands in the way of collaboration — and the benefits of a virtual office become obvious when cast under that light:</p><p>‍<br></p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As I reflect back on 2020, a year that was tough on human civilisation
as a whole, I am nevertheless grateful for the many positive experiences
of this year. This post is not a ‘humblebrag’ or a denial of the many
negative things of 2020<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but rather a brief recipe and reminder to
my future self to&nbsp;(further) develop and maintain an attitude of
gratitude. This post is written in the form of questions that I used to
ask myself, as well as the current set of answers I came up with. It is
my hope that readers will find some wisdom here.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I be grateful?</strong> Because, fundamentally, your life is not
about you. At least, it is not <em>just</em> about you. You are interacting<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
with so many other people and doing a lot of things on a daily basis.
You take all of this for granted—until it is not available any more.
So why not make an effort to be cognisant of their positive impact in
your life?</p>
<p><strong>Can I <em>choose</em> to be grateful?</strong> Yes, you can&nbsp;(see below for more
concrete tips). It is not built into most of us—and as the last year
mercilessly demonstrated, we often take things for granted, until they
are gone, and only <em>then</em> do we start bemoaning their loss.</p>
<p><strong>But is focusing on the positive not a denial of the negative?</strong> Our
brains are—at best—capable of producing medium-fidelity
representations of events in our lives, told from our perspective. While
some parts of our memory are more reliable than others, we are still
plagued by ‘bugs’ such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_effect">misinformation effect</a>.
Hence, why not make use of this and deliberately store the positive
things? In my experience, negative events, such as the loss of a loved
on or a severe illness, do not need additional reinforcement to be
remembered. But the small stuff, such as receiving a nice ‘Thank you’
note, will probably fall through the cracks. So, without denying that
bad things happen, why not pay attention to the positive ones?</p>
<p><strong>Will gratitude not stymie my efforts?</strong> This is a though one that
I admittedly wrestled with for a long time. If I am grateful for what
I already <em>have</em>, will I not stop wanting to be <em>more</em>? Setting aside
the question of whether it is useful to want ‘more’, I realised that
gratitude also brings a certain amount of clarity with it. For example,
I realised how grateful I was for the interactions with my colleagues
and students this year. This gave me a good idea of how large I want
my future research group to be—so in this sense, I now know that
I do not necessarily require a larger group, but this does not stifle my
application efforts or my research efforts in the slightest. On the
contrary: it makes me appreciate the time I can spend on these things
even more! I think that it is possible to be grateful for what you have,
and still aspire to improve your skills, your life situation, your
relationships, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>How to be grateful and remain it?</strong> Living on the command-line and in
<a href="https://www.vim.org/"><code>vim</code></a> for many of my working and waking hours,
the easiest solution for me is to have a file in which I can journal
things I am grateful for. This could be anything, from having a nice cup
of coffee while reading a well-written paper in the garden to receiving
a nice e-mail about my research or blog, thus reminding me that this is
not a solipsist adventure<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Put everything in there whenever you are
moved to do so, and after a few months, you can go back and re-read the
list—I promise you that you will be positively surprised!</p>
<p>As a parting thought, I can also encourage you to be included in other
people’s gratitude files: do not hesitate to express your gratitude to
those that helped you, inspired you, and went out of their way to
support you in any way<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> With that, I wish you a blessed 2021. May of
all you find lots of things to be grateful about. Until next time!</p>

<p>And for all of us, there were plenty of these! <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Maybe not in person, but certainly through other media… <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>One of my&nbsp;(many) blind spots is not being aware of the impact

                    <p>New Year is a great time to summarize the past year! So let’s see what happened with GitLab product.</p>
<p><span>This time I decided to focus on new features that were released in 2020 and to represent some interesting data and insights as charts. </span></p>
<p><span>As providers of DevOps and ALM solutions (and partners of GitLab company for 4+ years and using GitLab ourselves for 5+ years) we work intensively with customers using GitLab or those who are looking for solutions that can be provided by tools like GitLab.</span></p>
<p><span>The data we’re based on is open source and available online so we used GitLab API and GitLab CI to generate some interesting charts (and we even used GitLab runners to process some data).</span></p>
<p><span>The data below is based on the last 12 monthly releases, i.e. 12.7 (January 2020) to 13.7 (December 2020)</span></p>
<p><b>Total: 711 new features were released in that period.</b></p>
<h3>The most 10 popular features created over the past year:</h3>

<h3>Final notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We sometimes used 12.07 instead of 12.7 to avoid confusion (e.g. there’s a version named 12.10 which was released later than 12.7)</li>
<li>The numbers in the table above are valid for January 4th (those numbers might be changed in the future)</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="8.7.1"><div dir="ltr"><div><h3 id="viewer-foo"><span><span>We live in a digital age, technology has drastically changed how we live and keeping fit is no exception </span></span></h3><p id="viewer-9veah"><span>Because of the pandemic, more and more people have had to transition to working out at home, and as with most aspects of going into lockdown, technology has helped make that transition a lot easier. Here are 6 ways that technology is revolutionising working out at home whilst gyms have been closed! Will we ever need to go back?</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6dj21"><span>Wearable Technology </span></h2><p id="viewer-d9mjp"><span>Although it's been around for a while, wearable technology plays an important part in people fitness routines, such as fitness trackers which are always gaining in popularity with <span>one in five Americans now owning one. However, </span><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>it is debated</u></a><span> whether or not thes</span>e devices <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>help you to move more and get healthier</u></a>, because people mistake them for <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>motivational tools</u></a> whereas, in fact, the reason devices like Fitbit and Apple Watch exist is to help improve your fitnes<span>s routine, not make you stick to it. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-4eokf"><span>Wearable technology can provide you with valuable data and analysis into your performance, whether you're running, swimming or working out, by giving information about your heart rate, calories burned and more. The <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>new Apple Watch</u></a> will even tell you about your <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>blood oxygen level!</u></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-rnpl"><span>Virtual Training Apps</span></h2><p id="viewer-ei0tn"><span>Mobile fitness apps have also taken the world by storm and with lockdowns around the world due to the pandemic, many people have turned to these apps to make the most of their time at home. Nowadays there are hundreds of fitness apps available covering almost any aspect of fitness and health you can think of.</span></p><p id="viewer-6ujkj"><span>There is no doubt that these apps are having an enormous impact on the industry, thanks to the practicality of having a "virtual trainer" on your phone but that isn't to say that they're better than having a personal trainer and a gym membership. Although some of these apps, especially home workout apps, may promise amazing results, for the moment they still can't compete with the advice from a personal trainer and the variety of equipment available at a gym. </span></p><p id="viewer-8caip"><span>These apps are probably best for when you're on the move, tracking things like running and cycling or if you simply haven't got the time to go to the gym. </span></p><h2 id="viewer-f5fkr"><span>Gamification</span></h2><p id="viewer-7p4vf"><span>Despite being a relatively new addition to the fitness world, this new gym trend seems quite promising. Gamification is <span>the application of typical elements of game playing like point scoring, competition with others and rules of play to other areas of activity, in this case, fitness.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-fc5od"><span>When gamification is present in a fitness experience, it creates a fun, challenging environment for participants by creating <!-- -->lead boards and a sense of achievement and competition. This tech often exists in training apps, allowing you and your friends to see each other's performance like in the Strava and Nike Training apps, but gyms are now trying to integrate it too.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-e1g3g"><span><span>Suggested Articles:</span></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-aqpj0"><p><span>⌚️</span><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Fitness Trackers: Helping us Get Fit or Just Another Gadget</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-2udnu"><p><strong>🍎 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Apple Event September 2020, everything you need to know</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-2o9hk"><p><strong>📱 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/smartphones-the-true-cost-of-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Smartphones: The True Cost of Upgrades</u></strong></a><strong> ♻️</strong></p></li></ul><h2 id="viewer-98ft4"><span><strong>Smart, Connected Equipment </strong></span></h2><p id="viewer-evclh"><span>Some Gyms are now starting to offer smart and connected equipment to their members, offering them the ability to move from one gym to the other and <!-- -->continue to feed into their own personal data bank of performances. </span></p><p id="viewer-4c64s"><span>This new generation of equipment includes <!-- -->Bluetooth connectivity equipped spin cycles, treadmills and step machines and more! </span></p><h2 id="viewer-r6lc"><span>Virtual Reality Fitness</span></h2><p id="viewer-2i1v5"><span>Some gyms have even started using Virtual Reality (VR) fitness equipment with machines such as <!-- -->VirZOOM,<!-- --> a blend of stationary bikes and VR games and the <!-- -->Icaros flying machine<!-- -->, a core &amp; upper body focused VR. The main benefit of this is, of course, adding a bit of fun to your workouts, because there is no doubt that training your core while flying through space on your Icaros will be a bit more exciting than a set of lame crunches!</span></p><p id="viewer-915mg"><span>This ability to make have fun whilst working out and not have it all be about data and performance could be a game-changer for the industry, but in it's current state, VR fitness is by no means perfect. The obvious disadvantage is the awkwardness of working out in a headset, but that's not all, being a relatively new technology, debates on how long you should spend using a VR headset and what effects it could have on you brain and eyes in the long term are being had.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-d446h"><span>The Full Gym Experience - At Home! </span></h2><p id="viewer-77nna"><span>We've talked about virtual training apps, fitness trackers and connected equipment, but what if all this was to come in one, ultimate home fitness package?

			<p> After trying out Deno I got passionate about it. This post introduces my first Deno module, a simple preprocessor for HTML files that runs Deno where the new `&lt;deno&gt;` tag is specified. How useful can a simple file preprocessor be? What can it help build? </p>

		<p>Deno is gaining traction. A TypeScript runtime based on the Rust language and the V8 engine commonly associated with Node.js, or seen as the "new Node.js". After trying it out, I feel that Deno is much more than that. </p>
<p>Deno is a new thing. A new thing that gets it right and manages to improve even the few parts that were already top-notch in Node.js/JS.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/deno_deal_with_it.png" alt="Deno with the pixel sunglasses from the &quot;Deal With It&quot; meme" title="Deal with it"></p>
<h2 id="how-cool-is-deno">How cool is Deno?</h2>
<p>Technicalities apart, the heart of Deno resides in the URL. It is how modules get referenced, and your work gets exposed to the world—giving you the flexibility to distribute it as you please (in your super-private VPN org, maybe?).</p>
<p>Having the URL as the core is a driving force for a few base design decisions.
Naming things as closely as possible to what they are is a very nice improvement to the already great JavaScript module system. No more extension assumptions when importing modules. </p>
<p>This means that <code>import Rabbit from "magic"</code> no longer works: where is "magic" located? is it a <code>.js</code> ? a <code>.ts</code>? a folder with a default <code>index.js</code> export? Some 3rd party "package" in your packages cache? Which version? or is it any other kind of file that your chosen bundler decides to import for you?</p>
<p>Deno also carefully shares a set of API's with the browser, allowing lazy devs like me to compound the knowledge of <a href="https://deno.land/manual/runtime/web_platform_apis">standard JavaScript browser API's</a>, bringing it to places outside the browser.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://deno.land/manual@v1.6.3/runtime/permission_apis#permission-descriptors">security model</a> granularity resembles the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man2/pledge.2">OpenBSD pledge</a> approach. It forces the module execution into a restricted-service operating mode set by each permission specific flag and allowances. If your module tries to do something that was not whitelisted, it will throw an exception.</p>
<p>The Deno <a href="https://deno.land/manual/contributing/style_guide">style guide for contributors</a> is a great read and can serve as a base for the code style guide in companies that lack it. The included linter rules (<code>deno lint</code>) already do a great job at enforcing a part of these guidelines.</p>
<p>If you are now starting a new project or trying to refresh some old codebase, then Deno might give you that fresh edge that your project needs.</p>
<h2 id="deno-as-a-preprocessor-of-html">Deno as a preprocessor of HTML</h2>
<p>One of the things that attracted me initially to Deno was that it includes with its single binary <code>deno</code> the ability to bundle dependencies and run tests. No more Webpack. No more Jest. Think of it as TypeScript with batteries included - btw, why doesn't <code>tsc</code> resolve imports and outputs bundles? Because it's a "compiler" and not a "linker"... yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>With Deno, I get in its single binary, a simple API, and a set of tools to use from the Command Line Interface.</p>
<p>Now, what if it would be possible to run Deno from within an HTML file?</p>
<p>Yes, like PHP but with Deno munching TypeScript. </p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/deno_spectrum.png" alt="Deno logo next to the PHP logo with a rainbow heart in between" title="Its a spectrum..."></p>
<h2 id="nevermind-the-php-here-s-the-deno-tag">Nevermind the <code>&lt;?php&gt;</code> here's the <code>&lt;deno&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/HugoDaniel/deno_tag/">deno_tag</a> is my first Deno module. I have been using it in the simple drawing web app I am building (Shape The Pixel).</p>
<p>The idea is that you can include a <code>&lt;deno&gt;</code> tag in your project's HTML files and then preprocess them into regular HTML files.</p>
<p><em>What does this new tag do?</em></p>
<p>It runs the <code>deno</code> command on the specified file and replaces the <code>&lt;deno&gt;</code> tag with its output.</p>
<p>Here is an example, suppose you have this file called <code>advanced_logic.ts</code> with this content:</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>("</span><span>PHP is the best computer language ever invented!</span><span>");
</span></code></pre>
<p>Just an example. The <code>&lt;deno&gt;</code> tag would transform something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;Super Advanced Concepts Inc. Like Alien Magic Actually.&lt;/</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>deno </span><span>run</span><span>="</span><span>advanced_logic.ts</span><span>" /&gt;&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Into this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;Super Advanced Concepts Inc. Like Alien Magic Actually.&lt;/</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;PHP is the best computer language ever invented!&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>It runs something similar to <code>deno run advanced_logic.ts</code> and pipes the execution's output directly into the location of the <code>&lt;deno&gt;</code> tags. </p>
<p>The tag can handle other attributes besides <code>run</code>. It can also bundle your modules with <code>&lt;deno bundle="my_app.ts" /&gt;</code>. Perfect for including within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags and having the HTML file include a bundle of your code and its imports.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;Super Advanced Concepts Inc. Like Alien Magic Actually.&lt;/</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>deno bundle</span><span>="</span><span>my_app.ts</span><span>" /&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Just call the <code>deno_tag</code> CLI on your build scripts or release playbooks to have the HTML files ready to go.</p>
<h3 id="the-possibilities-are-endless">The possibilities are endless</h3>
<p>Preprocess your static assets?
Bundle the SVG's into a single string?
Call mom?
Ping the coffee machine?</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;deno&gt;</code> tag is here for the rescue!</p>
<p><em>Why not use PHP?</em></p>
<p>I love PHP and use it whenever appropriate. It is my favorite backend language for the web. The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php">PHP "include"</a> logic is great and resembles this somehow (<code>&lt;?PHP include "something.php"; ?&gt;</code>). However, I tend to like to work closer to front-end development, and keeping these HTML/Web parts in TypeScript is the wave to surf these days 🏄‍♂️.</p>
<p><em>Why not use /bin/sh?</em></p>
<p>I don't know why 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/HugoDaniel/deno_tag/"><code>README.md</code></a> file in the deno_tag repository includes a couple more examples and a more detailed description of its parts. <a href="https://github.com/HugoDaniel/deno_tag/">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>This is also available as a <em>deno.land/x</em> third-party module <a href="https://deno.land/x/deno_tag">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
<p><em>Editor’s Note: When many people think of the U.S. Secret Service, they picture the unruffled agents who protect the president and other dignitaries. But the agency’s founding mission—and one that it still carries out—is to safeguard the U.S. financial system from counterfeiting and other crimes. Over the last few decades, many of those crimes have shifted online: Hackers breach companies for financial information, sell stolen credit card numbers, encrypt corporate data until a ransom is paid, and trick victims into wiring funds to scam accounts. As a result, cybercrime has become the focus of much of the Secret Service’s work, and the agency plays a key role in investigating a range of computer-related incidents.</em></p>



<p><em>The details of this work sometimes emerge in court cases and law enforcement actions. Secret Service agents are often the ones who investigate and arrest high-profile </em><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2014/07/07/us-secret-service-arrests-one-worlds-most-prolific-traffickers-stolen-financial"><em>hackers</em></a><em>, darknet </em><a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2020/06/russian-national-sentenced-prison-operating-websites-devoted-fraud-and"><em>vendors</em></a><em>, and other perpetrators of computer-related crime. But much of their work happens in the shadows, with undercover agents, million-dollar </em><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-offers-2-million-reward-in-global-search-for-ukrainians-accused-of-hacking-sec-database/30741867.html"><em>bounties</em></a><em>, and other methods that can sound like they’re lifted from the pages of a spy thriller.</em></p>



<p><em>Until recently, Richard LaTulip was one of the Secret Service’s special agents who went undercover to better understand cybercriminals. On occasion, he would even befriend hackers. “I opened the door and there on the other side was the target standing with a liter of vodka… a gift from their home country,” he recalled. LaTulip, who left the agency in July to join the private sector, opened up about his experiences at the Secret Service in a recent interview with Recorded Future expert threat intelligence analyst Dmitry Smilyanets. The two first met in 2012, when Smilyanets himself was interviewed by LaTulip in relation to his involvement in a major data breach investigation. The interview below was conducted via email, and has been lightly edited for clarity.</em></p>



<p><strong>Dmitry Smilyanets: You recently retired and are now a civilian after 22 years of service with the U.S. Secret Service. Do you miss your badge yet?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Richard LaTulip:</strong> When I reflect back and contemplate my career, I can honestly say it was a rewarding and meaningful experience.&nbsp;Along the way, I was able to contribute at all levels, gained a lot of invaluable knowledge, and traveled extensively. During this time period, I met a wide range of people, professionally and privately. These opportunities left an impression in my life and it was regardless of the length of time spent with these people. For example, some I may only have spent hours with, others were moments in time, and still others whom I now consider friends impacted my life because I learned from their experiences, gained an understanding from their perspective, understood more about their cultures and this allowed me the unique opportunity to grow as a person and to mature.&nbsp;Far too often we move through life; experience unique things and forget to stop and truly appreciate the experience and opportunity.&nbsp;This prepared me for the other adventures in my life I had yet to know or understand or even knew were coming my way. During my career, I learned how to better appreciate people, places, cultures, and countries. This has made me a better person and I am forever thankful for this chance.&nbsp;But your question was do I already miss the badge? To some degree, I will always miss the badge.&nbsp;Working as a special agent was a large part of who I am and what I represented.&nbsp;However, because I was fortunate enough to be employed by the U.S. Secret Service, I feel I can now take these experiences and share them with others.&nbsp;This is a new page in a long novel, and I am looking forward to meeting new people and continuing to grow and share.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What were some of your most exciting experiences at the Secret Service? Which were most challenging?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Thailand_2006-1.png" alt="LaTulip in Thailand" width="396" height="531" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Thailand_2006-1.png 625w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Thailand_2006-1-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption>LaTulip (right) engaging with a suspect on a 2006 undercover mission in Thailand. <em>Courtesy of Richard LaTulip</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>RL:</strong> My career spanned 25 years, but 22 years were with the U.S. Secret Service so as one can imagine I had a lot of exciting experiences. But I can say the most exciting was working the various cybercrime investigations and of course this included my time working on the various underground online forums.&nbsp;From 2005 through approximately 2009, I worked online as an undercover U.S. Secret Service agent who purported to be a buyer of stolen data.&nbsp;In order to establish a level of credibility, I relied on the guidance of an informant.&nbsp;This informant was and had been working in the underground community for a period of time and became established&nbsp;within a specific group of online cybercriminals. The informant provided a level of bona fides within the community and I was able to seize this opportunity and expand upon it. The informant was by my side often, then not too much, and then at various points in time to assist in the investigation, but we’ll come back to this later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working online as a cybercriminal by night and then a U.S. Secret Service agent by day represented challenges that are not easy to explain.&nbsp;I had to translate the successes from the online world to understandable and meaningful language to those who have not experienced nor understood the challenges.&nbsp;In addition, and unlike what is seen at times in the movies or TV, I was writing reports, recording evidence, documenting online conversations, participating in conference calls with USSS headquarters representatives. You know, all the nitty-gritty work that is not as glamorous but was required to ensure a successful investigation and eventual successful prosecution.</p>



<p>Anyhow, the informant and I worked odd hours because the case was global. We needed to match time zones and seize on the opportunities when others, the target of the investigation, were online and working.&nbsp;Now talking online and creating rapport behind a computer represented challenges but our goal was different.&nbsp;Our goal was to be the first investigation, at that time, to take our online behind the computer undercover world, the digital world, and turn this into real-world operations.&nbsp;We planned and designed the case so we would travel, as needed, too far away destinations and meet face-to-face with those with whom I was speaking to online on a regular basis. Obviously, this presented unique challenges—we contemplated “the Who” to meet, “the where” to meet, and tempered this with “Where” we were able to meet. The planning and preparing for this style of operation was exciting, demoralizing, interesting, stressful, and rewarding all at the same time.</p>



<p>Because I was able to establish a positive relationship with the informant—one that, in my opinion, was based on mutual respect and understanding of each other—I feel because I gained the respect of the informant this translated to a higher level of devotion and more energy was invested to meet the investigative goals.&nbsp;Again, we speak of challenges, on one hand you have those that live in the world of law enforcement, those who chose an opposite path than those in law enforcement, and then the rest of the world.&nbsp;So, if you were going to be successful, you needed to have a unique personality, in order to bridge the gap between the rest of the world and those who chose the other side of law enforcement.&nbsp;One needed to establish a level of mutual respect.&nbsp;I will say not everyone is geared for this and to be able to work between these worlds is not easy. But for me, I saw it differently.&nbsp;I saw everyone, probably because of my fortitude to travel extensively, as good people—some just chose a different direction, but still they are good people.&nbsp;Therefore, I did everything in my power to never treat anyone differently or treat them in a way I would not want to be treated.&nbsp;For me, this worked well because when I spoke with a member of law enforcement—U.S. or International, a citizen or a “cybercriminal”—I treated them all with the same level of respect.</p>



<p>But where is this all going or where did it end within three months, we were able to arrange the first International meetings which are a completely different and interesting story on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I spoke about a lot of what I did but let’s not forget everything I did or accomplished relied on the guidance, assistance, goodwill, hard work, and determination of my colleagues in the USSS, other U.S. government agencies, and international partners. Without this assistance and goodwill, I would not have been able to achieve this level of success. However, what I described to you was the most exciting and challenging time in my career.</p>



<p><strong>DS: You were not just a Special Agent—you were one of the most experienced in the Service’s Cyber Intelligence Section. Can you please explain the significance of CIS? What are the main differences between CIS and the Criminal Investigative Division?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RL:</strong> So, to understand the significance I should start by explaining the CID. In the U.S. Secret Service, there are several different divisions, and CID is one of the divisions. CIS is an investigative section within CID. Over time, CIS has gone through several name branding changes. However, the assessment was that the USSS field offices had a lot of responsibilities, management identified a gap, and determined the USSS needed a group of dedicated professionals who either assist or manage the USSS’s most significant investigations. From the beginning, management’s vision was that CIS will be reserved for the USSS’s most accomplished investigators and specifically designed to investigate, locate, identify, and arrest the advanced persistent threat. This same group of dedicated professionals is not only tasked with managing significant investigations, but these agents were also tasked with debriefing the arrested top-tiered cybercriminals, building relationships with international partners, managing significant operations, act as liaisons with federal prosecutors, working with federal, …</p></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Megaphone is a podcast hosting provider. All podcast hosting providers collect listener stats, but that's only seen by the hosting provider and the podcaster themselves. Stats are fine, but Megaphone collects listener data in order to serve targeted ads to listeners. Not only that, they are sharing this data with big ad tech like Neilsen Media Research. Which is bad for privacy and creepy. So bad that some anti-tracking tools are blocking all podcasts hosted on Megaphone.</p><p>Full discloser: I use Megaphone as the hosting provider for my podcast.</p><h2 id="what-is-going-on">What is going on?</h2><p>Here's a video made by Megaphone explaining what they are doing and what MTM is.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/281670844?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="Megaphone for Advertisers"></iframe></figure><p>In short they have a service called Megaphone Targeted Marketplace (MTM) which tracks listener behavior and pairs it with Nielsen segments to present listeners with ads that are targeted for them. It's actually some amazing tech because if you think about it, all that has to be done on demand in real time and new ads are stitched into the mp3 as it streams over to the listener. </p><p>A more longer version is that when you request an mp3 from Megaphone to listen to, you first request it from traffic.megaphone.fm. Then it redirects to adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud, which grabs all kinds of listener data such as geo location and type of device and sends that to <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/">Neilsen Media Research</a> to find a an ad for the listener. It then redirects the listener to the actual mp3 which is hosted on dcs.megaphone.fm. The problem is, listener data is now being collected by an advertising agency. Which means podcast listeners may be tracked across multiple shows even.</p><p>Megaphone <a href="https://megaphone.fm/adchoices">has a website which explains</a> their ad choices and even gives you a link to Neislen to opt out of targeted ads. However it's not clear that if you opt-out in the browser if it also opts-out for the podcast players too.</p><p>Also from <a href="https://www.megaphone.fm/terms/privacy">Megaphone's privacy policy</a> it explicitly says they are collecting listener data:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-4.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-4.png 1484w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And later in the privacy policy it says this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-6.png 1554w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So Megaphone makes it clear they are collecting listener data and sharing it with ad tech companies (such as Neilsen) to insert targeted ads into podcasts.</p><p>And of course when people listen to podcasts they have no idea where it's hosted, and aren't going to look through this privacy policy to even know their data is collected and shared with advertisers.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-a-problem">Why is this a problem?</h2><p>Well as it turns out people don't like being tracked. And there's a whole suite of anti-tracking privacy tools out there. There are DNS sinkhole services like <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">pi-hole</a> and <a href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS</a> which block domains that track you, there are browser plugins to block this like <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdBlockPlus</a>, <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>, and <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">PrivacyBadger</a>, and there are browsers that block this too like <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>. These tools work tirelessly to figure out what website are tracking us and it blocks them so they can't do it anymore. Megaphone tracks listeners. </p><h2 id="megaphone-is-now-blocked">Megaphone is now blocked</h2><p>For the first time this has become an issue. At no point in the history of podcasting has this ever been an issue before, but now it is (thanks to Megaphone). In the last few months certain blocklists have began adding Megaphone to them. This means that people who use some of the tools above may not be able to play some of their favorite podcasts.</p><p>For instance when you go to my podcast website and try to play my podcast with an up to date version of Brave, you cannot play the audio. When you hit the play button you get a big red exclamation point.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image.png 998w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Then when you investigate what's going on you see that Megaphone was blocked.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-1.png 754w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And there's the real problem, Brave blocked traffic.megaphone.fm because it considers it a tracker. This means podcast listeners cannot play podcasts if they use certain privacy tools and tracker blockers. It's not like Brave can block just the tracking part of Megaphone and let through the audio. No it blocks the audio which fundamentally breaks the podcast listening experience.</p><h2 id="what-blocklists-is-megaphone-showing-up-on">What blocklists is Megaphone showing up on?</h2><p>Once again, when someone goes to listen to a podcast (mp3) hosted on Megaphone it first goes to traffic.megaphone.fm which is just a CNAME for adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud. And this <a href="https://blocklist-tools.developerdan.com/entries/search?q=adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud">does show up on some blocklists</a>. </p><p>(The ones with the green check marks means it appears in the blocklist. The red ones mean it was on the list previously.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-3.png 1486w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>That's 6 blocklists that lists Megaphone! </p><p><strong><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> is blocking Megaphone</strong>. This is a privacy focused browser which has a feature called shields which blocks ads and trackers by default. Specifically it blocks traffic.megaphone.fm because that<a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=cname%3atraffic.megaphone.fm&amp;run=toolpage"> has a CNAME</a> resolution to adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud, which does appear on one of their blocklists. <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates-6/">Brave blocks CNAMES</a> which resolve to domains on the blocklist. </p><p><strong><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> is blocking Megaphone.</strong> This is a browser plugin to block ad content. It sees that when you go to download an mp3 it sends you to adserver.va3.megaphone.cloud and blocks it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-5.png 600w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-5.png 1000w, https://blog.lime.link/content/images/2021/01/image-5.png 1256w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now the reason Brave and uBlock are blocking Megaphone is because they use the standard <a href="https://easylist.to/">EasyList blocklist</a>. But if you search EasyList you won't see Megaphone. Instead it's hitting the rules that look like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>.adserver. 
/adserver/*
_adserver.
###AdServer
##.ADServer
&amp;adserver=
</code></pre>

I have a podcast hosted on Megaphone. I even used MTM in the past, but it's always felt creepy to me, so I switched it off because I don't feel comfortable tracking listeners like that. Which means I am leaving money on the table, but choose my listeners privacy over the extra money the show would generate. And I have confirmed that by disabling MTM, Megaphone won't share my listener data with Neilsen. Yet, because my show is hosted by a company that does track some listeners, I'm being negatively impacted by this. I have to tell listeners to whitelist my hosting provider so they can play my show. My show is suffering from collateral damage. And this is particularly bad because I make a podcast about all the nasty stuff that goes on over the internet. I look like a damn hypocrite for hosting with Megaphone. But it's not so easy to up and move hosting providers. First of all not many hosting providers do dynamic ad insertion, which is what I need, but second it would mean losing all my stats and having to do tech support on helping tons of listeners move over to the new RSS feed. And I like Megaphone as a host, they have a good service and I continue to use them even though I don't use MTM. Which means MTM isn't their secret sauce to success. It is only a small feature they offer and it isn't crucial to their business. They don't need it and they can succeed just as well. So I'd rather not leave them. I'd rather they make a better decision on what kind of company they want to be.</p><h2 id="tracking-listeners-like-this-is-creepy">Tracking listeners like this is creepy</h2><p>Megaphone's competitor is <a href="https://art19.com/">Art19</a> (Megaphone is bigger).

                    <hr> 
                    <p>The web is thirty years old, counting from the date the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/08/history-of-the-web/origins.htm">first web server was launched in December 1990</a>. I first saw it emerge on August 6th, 1991, when the web was publicly announced. But after 30 years, I think we’ve lost sight of its original purpose. Here’s what I mean.</p>

<p>In 1991 I was writing for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> magazine, which was a lot of fun because I got to work with, and write about, people who were doing fascinating things with computer technology. Working for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> led to writing the book <em>Taking the Next Step</em> and a short stint at Steve Jobs’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> as a technical writer.</p>

<p>The most innovative project I encountered that year was not NeXT. Rather, it was something developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a researcher at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, the European particle physics laboratory. He used a NeXT computer to develop a networked information system for high-energy physicists. If I hadn’t been reading  the <em>comp.sys.next</em> Usenet newsgroups carefully, I would have missed the announcement of “a hypertext editor for the NeXT.”</p>

<p>Not many people used “WWWNeXTStepEditor version 0.12.” The NeXT community was small, and many NeXT computer users did not yet have Internet access, which was required to access Tim Berners-Lee’s experimental “WorldWideWeb” documents. To me, the name WorldWideWeb seemed a bit of a conceit since the only users at the time were high-energy physicists at a few research institutes.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, as soon as I’d installed and tried the software, I wanted to get involved. I told everyone about it, including a fellow editor at <em>NeXTWORLD,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>. Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, and co-founder of the (then-new) Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor">Mitch Kapor</a> to say, here’s “Something called World Wide Web, which sounds rather like Project Xanadu emerging from the Matrix almost without design. This could be cool.”</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-barlow.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you don’t recognize Barlow’s references, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Project Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a> was a visionary hypertext project that predated the Internet. The <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/Matrix.html">Matrix</a> is not the movie universe created by the Wachowskis but rather the totality of computer networks that existed before the commercialization of the Internet (as described by the researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quarterman">John Quarterman</a>).</p>

<p>Subsequently, I joined the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0001.html">www-talk mailing list</a> and also contacted Tim Berners-Lee directly. I wanted to know if he was interested in technology I’d heard about from friends at Adobe Systems. Adobe’s editable PostScript specification (which came to be named PDF and became the basis for a product named “Acrobat”) seemed to me a better match for distributed hypertext than the very-limited SGML-based “HTML tags” that Tim Berners-Lee was using. HTML offered only minimal layout and styling possibilities; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> was a better page description language.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-timbl.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee was reluctant to publicize that code for the web was available for free, as management at CERN had not yet agreed to release it publicly (that didn’t happen until <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399">April 1993</a>). Plus, the editors at <em>NeXTWORLD</em> were not interested in a product that was only useful for a few NeXT users with Internet access, so I wasn’t able to write about it for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> (too bad, as I could have been the first journalist to write about the web!).</p>

<p>A year later, editable PostScript was released, and in 1993, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> of CERN visited me in California. I arranged a meeting between Cailliau and management at Adobe Systems. He met with John Kunze of Adobe at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and demonstrated the WorldWideWeb — the first time management at Adobe had seen the web. By that time, HTML was firmly entrenched as the native language of the new web. Adobe later invested in Netscape Communications and produced an Acrobat plug-in for the Netscape web browser, establishing the basis for viewing richly formatted PDF pages in web browsers.</p>

<p>For some years afterward, I regretted that the Adobe/WWW meeting had not taken place the previous year, because I imagined the richer PDF language might have eclipsed the sparse and limited HTML language as the primary syntax of web pages. With the adoption of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/">Cascading Style Sheets specification</a> (from 1999 forward), my views changed. I’ve come to appreciate that the technical underpinnings of the web are optimal, reflecting both the genius of Berners-Lee’s original vision and the rich contributions of the worldwide developer community.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, it is easy to overlook the web’s origins as a tool for sharing knowledge. Key to Tim Berners-Lee’s vision were open standards that reflected his belief in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower">Rule of Least Power</a>, a principle that choosing the simplest and least powerful language for a given purpose allows you to do more with the data stored in that language (thus, HTML is easier for humans or machines to interpret and analyze than PostScript). Along with open standards and the Rule of Least Power, Tim Berners-Lee wanted to make it easy for anyone to publish information in the form of web pages. His first web browser, named Nexus, was both a browser and editor. The NeXTSTEP SDK made editing easy to implement; editing was abandoned in subsequent non-NeXT web browsers.</p>

<p>I think we’ve lost sight of that original vision. Facebook or Wix makes it easy to author web pages but at the cost of lock-in to proprietary systems. And when developers choose complex software such as React or Rails to build simple websites, I cringe at the violation of Rule of Least Power. I still have a “deep case of net religion” (as John Perry Barlow said in 1991), and I’m now writing about ways to build websites without frameworks and build tools (see my articles, <a href="https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/build-websites-the-yax-way/index.html">Build Websites the Stackless Way</a>). My current project, <a href="https://yax.com/">Yax.com</a>, is a do-it-yourself website builder that uses new web standards (including web components) to help people build simple sites. Thirty years on, we still have a lot of work to do to realize the web’s original goals. I hope I’m not the only one who sees this.</p>

<p>I never anticipated that Berners-Lee’s NeXT hypertext project would become a medium to supplant print and television. In 1991, during idle moments, I imagined the world’s books and magazines might be reborn as hypertext (many others had imagined this earlier, including Ted Nelson, with his Xanadu project). But I never honestly believed that Berners-Lee’s software project could change the world. By 1999, as web addresses appeared on billboards and the sides of buses, I started to accept that Berners-Lee naming his project “the WorldWide Web” was not vainglorious but merely prescient. Still, I hope its utility as a platform for commerce does not eclipse our original vision of the web as a means for sharing the world’s knowledge.</p>

<p>I’m probably going to have to eat this blog post 2 years from now…. oh well. I still believe that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Async</a> has been mostly a failure since introduced in Python 3.4. Maybe I should be more specific, there seems to be a failure to adopt Async in the Python community and major packages at large. Sure, there are glimmers of hope like <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/">aiohttp</a>, but for the most part all the Async work and adoption seems to be on the fringes of the Python world. Why is this?</p>



<h2>Why has the adoption of Async in the Python community at large failed?</h2>



<p>I believe there are a few pretty straight forward reasons for this.</p>



<ul><li>It isn’t easy to use or understand how to use. It just isn’t Pythonic.</li><li>Its implementation has changed drastically over some minor Python versions, early in Async’s journey.</li><li>A combination of multithreading and multiprocessing can give the same speed improvements, in more straightforward way.</li></ul>



<p>Let’s cover each of these.</p>



<h3>It isn’t easy to use or understand how to use. It just isn’t Pythonic.</h3>



<p>Some of the examples and tutorials you run across right away might appear simple, try to lure you in. I can almost guarantee writing a fully async problem in the real world won’t be as straight forward and easy the first 100 times as you think it will be. Part of the reason Python has become so popular is that it is so approachable for the average person. It lowers the bar, for better or worse, of the programming entry point.</p>



<p>Async raises that bar again. Here is extremely simple example. </p>



<pre><code>import asyncio
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from datetime import datetime


async def fetch(url, session):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.read()


async def run():
    urls = ['http://www.cnn.com',
            'http://www.foxnews.com',
            'http://www.nbcnews.com',
            'http://www.abcnews.com',
            'http://www.usatoday.com/news',
            'https://www.bbc.com/news/world']
    tasks = []

    async with ClientSession() as session:
        for url in urls:
            task = asyncio.ensure_future(fetch(url, session))
            tasks.append(task)
        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return responses

t1 = datetime.now()
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
future = asyncio.ensure_future(run())
responses = loop.run_until_complete(future)
for response in responses:
    print(response)
t2 = datetime.now()
timer = t2 - t1
print(f'Process took {timer} seconds')</code></pre>



<p>At first glance this might appear not too bad. But start to look closer, find all the <strong>async, await, ensure_future, gather</strong> etc. They are sprinkled throughout the code. It just isn’t that obvious. All the sudden the simple task of calling a bunch of website content. Granted it is pretty fast. <strong>Process took 0:00:00.896876 seconds</strong>.</p>



<p>Writing good async code just requires a different through process and approach from the normal Python routine. You have to think about understand the blocking parts of your codebase, figure out if the libraries you are using are async compatible or have async versions. You have to think about futures, awaiting, and event loops. It’s just a different way of thinking and once you commit to it, your codebase is going to look substantially different. And most likely trouble shooting is going to take on a new meaning. </p>



<h3>Its implementation has changed drastically over some minor Python versions, early in Async’s journey.</h3>



<p>When I first started to dabble with and write async Python code, when reading documentation and tutorials, it quickly became clear it mattered which version of Python I was on. It was evident that the form and function of writing Aync code had/has changed a lot between 3.4 and 3.6+. Enough where the code just wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>It was extremely confusing and frustrating at that point. When you have a new paradigm that is as hard to embrace and understand as Async, the last thing you want to do is the bait and switch. Also, the numerous different ways to express and accomplish the same tasks didn’t help either. </p>



<h3>A combination of multithreading and multiprocessing can give the same speed improvements, in more straightforward way.</h3>



<p>Let’s re-write the above example in a Multihreading way.</p>



<pre><code>from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import requests
from datetime import datetime


urls = ['http://www.cnn.com',
        'http://www.foxnews.com',
        'http://www.nbcnews.com',
        'http://www.abcnews.com',
        'http://www.usatoday.com/news',
        'https://www.bbc.com/news/world']


def get_url(url: str):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.content


t1 = datetime.now()
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=6) as thready:
    results = thready.map(get_url, urls)
for result in results:
    print(result)
t2 = datetime.now()
timer = t2 - t1
print(f'Process took {timer} seconds')</code></pre>



<p>Not bad, straightforward code, and by George it’s a little faster. <strong>Process took 0:00:00.793653 seconds</strong>. This is most likely the problem with Async being adopted into the mainstream Python community as a whole. It’s a hard sell to move from easy to write code and can be maintained and tested, to much more complex and hard to troubleshoot async code.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love async and write code as such when I get a chance. I think it’s a good mental exercise and I wish certain popular packages would support async. Pushing yourself to understand new way of writing code is always a good exercise. But I have my doubts about if Async will ever be a “mainstream” way of writing Python code now and in the future for most programmers. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-hacking-coronavirus-pandemic-russia-350ae2fb2e513772a4dc4b7360b8175c" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SolarWinds</a> hack continues to make news and every day some more details reach the surface. Fortune 500 companies, large U.S. federal government agencies, security vendors and operating system vendors are affected and its putting the spotlight on how fragile and sensitive the software development cycle is. Using best practices and digital certificates make you check some boxes on your checklist, but this hack shows clearly the need of additional protection. The bottom line is - if your CI/CD pipeline and your code release is unsafe, the door is wide open and invites people with bad intentions. Furthermore, all the money and effort you put into automation, vulnerability scanning and DevOps training is wasted.</p>
<p>This blog post covers the hack as well as the trusted CI/CD pipeline on a high level. If you're interested in the technical details please check our <a href="https://codenotary.com/blog/solarwinds-sunburst" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other blog post</a> as well. </p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-happened-here">What exactly happened here?</h2>
<p>SolarWinds, a popular IT monitoring and management vendor, made clear that hackers breached its systems and inserted malware into the software build process of its <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Orion platform</a>. As this was undetected for a long time, product updates shipped with the vulnerability for several months. That malware introduced a backdoor to access running <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Orion</a> servers on customers infrastructures. </p>
<p>As many customers are using the Orion platform and do their job in having the software always updated, it's estimated that roughly 18.000 customers installed the backdoor and many got <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/fireeye-solarwinds-hack-genuinely-impacted-50-victims-a-15637" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">breached</a>. </p>
<p>Those affected include <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and FireEye, a cyber security vendor which first <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detected</a> the attack this month after the hackers stole <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/unauthorized-access-of-fireeye-red-team-tools.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proprietary security tools</a> it offers to its clients.</p>
<h2 id="the-legitimate-malware">The legitimate malware</h2>
<p>The real problem of this hack is its scope. </p>
<p>The attackers found a way to <strong>legitimize the malware</strong> by injecting it into the build pipeline. That build pipeline started to produce digitally signed and trusted software for over 18.000 customers worldwide. Currently it's not known, how many customers really installed the malware, but none of them would have questioned software signed and introduced by SolarWinds. And that's the real problem, the build pipeline produces builds and they are digitally signed with the SolarWinds certificate trusted by the Certificate authorities in Microsoft Windows, macOS and your browser. Revoking the digital certificate revokes the good and the bad software, as you can't differentiate between these.</p>
<p><strong>This given trust in digital certificates and company brand is the real issue.</strong></p>

<p>Let's make it clear! SolarWinds didn't run a security lacking, lousy maintained development lifecycle - they already did a lot to secure the build process and delivery by having architectural reviews, static and dynamic code analysis, open-source analysis, vulnerability checking and more.  After the hack was realized, they added more security related steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further restricting access rights to its build environment</li>
<li>Using a new code-signing certificate for new builds</li>
<li>Reviewing the build environment’s architecture, the privileged and non-privileged users with access to it, and the network surrounding it</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-avoid-these-attacks-in-the-future">How to avoid these attacks in the future?</h2>
<p>It wasn't a big open hole, the attackers used - it was a very sophisticated attack. Not entirely true, as there were some <a href="https://threatpost.com/solarwinds-default-password-access-sales/162327/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FTP credentials</a> in a public Git repository. Nevertheless, it's unclear if that FTP account was even part of that attack.</p>
<p>Of course, the big question to answer is, what can be done to avoid these widespread hacks in the future? Every vendor and security expert has its own favorite answer to it, but it all comes down to: There is a need for a comprehensive, holistic <strong>DevSecOps</strong> strategy, that aims to provide full observability:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is being used (bill of material)</li>
<li>when are certain components or open-source projects used</li>
<li>what is currently running in my build process</li>
<li>what is currently running in my production environment</li>
<li>who did introduce what component</li>
<li>who did approve what artifacts before being used/deployed</li>
<li>what is effected if the component will be updated or <strong>removed</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-trusted-cicd-pipeline">The trusted CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that highly sophisticated hacker can use the tiniest flaw to get into systems and won't stop to be very innovative. But that's not a reason to give up, only to make it harder for them every single day.</p>
<p>A trusted CI/CD pipeline where every used open source project, artifact, or module (hopefully) is known and compatibility tested before being integrated into a release that is going to be shipped or deployed is the most important start. </p>
<p>Therefore, our customers use CodeNotary to notarize every step and artifact within the pipeline by people (Developers, QA) or systems (vulnerability checker, compatibility testing software aso.).</p>
<p><img alt="trustedcicd" src="https://codenotary.com/images/blog/trustedcicd.jpg"></p>
<p>You can think of having the unique identity of every single artifact and the bill of material of your build cryptographically verifiably stored on an immutable ledger. Using CodeNotary Ledger Compliance you can choose to use a fast (up to 60.000 TX/min) worldwide distributed consortium blockchain (CodeNotary Ledger Compliance CI/CD) or an ultra-fast (up to 10.000.000 TX/sec) on-premise deployment (CodeNotary Ledger Compliance) or both.</p>
<p>When integrating the CodeNotary solution into your CI/CD pipeline, you gain <strong>4 main benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tamperproof history of all digital artifacts (single artifact and bill of material of the build)</li>
<li>Machines and people can notarize and authenticate every individual artifact inside or outside of your premises</li>
<li>Notarization can be done for every individual artifact using different states (Trusted, Untrusted, Unsupported)</li>
<li>Authentication can be done publicly by anyone with internet access (i. e. to check the current state of the download or build)</li>
</ul>
<p>The CI/CD protection can <strong>uniquely identify</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>git repositories (source code)</li>
<li>CI/CD pipeline (<a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TravisCI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a> and many more)</li>
<li>Container images</li>
<li>Files and folders (i. e. configuration files, build files, CI/CD recipes, installer binaries and many more)</li>
</ul>
<p>One benefit that should not be underestimated is the possibility to change the trust level of any digital object at any time and that everybody that should have access to that information can verify it. When using digital certificates you can only revoke that certificate for everything you ever signed, using CodeNotary you can precisely change the status of a certain release or artifact. </p>
<p><strong>Unlike the digital certificate approach using CodeNotary you can untrust your release the moment you realize there is a malware or even a non-approved component in it without giving up your whole trust chain.</strong></p>
<p>That allows fine grained observability of your build and release lifecycle as well as fine grained revocation of artifacts that have gone bad.</p>
<p>The combination of machine and user identity (separated from your SSO or inhouse user management), unique digital artifact identities and trust level (<strong>including a timestamp</strong>) is already powerful but worthless if stored in a normal database.</p>
<p><strong>Key is to store that information in an immutable ledger, that is always accessible and maintains the full history of changes.</strong></p>
<p>That is exactly what CodeNotary provides - tamperproof trust at every stage of your pipeline from source to deployment and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="secure-physical-access">Secure physical access</h2>
<p>Last but not least , we need to cover the physical access (SSH, Console, KVM) to the systems that run and distribute your code and builds.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're always looking to integrate security technology that allows protecting physical access as well. Crypto cards to secure the cryptographic root signing by the server or integrating Intel SGX and its protected enclave mechanism are just some examples how we make sure, that even a local physical access to manipulate artifacts can be observed and alerted on or of course protected against.</p>

<td>The need of support for handling measurement units does not require any approval.
It is in particular true for the Ada programming language with its stress
on safety and maintainability. The proposed set of packages represents a
possible solution of the unit problem. Dimension checking is performed at
run-time, so performance is sacrificed for safety. However, an attempt was
made to reduce performance hit. The type Measure used to represent dimensioned
values can be constrained to a specific unit. Operations on constrained subtypes
of Measure could be potentially as efficient as floating-point operations.
They are declared inlined, so that at least theoretically, a decent compiler
could perform discriminant calculation and check at compile time.<p>
The key features of the approach:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    The type Unit denotes the dimension of a physical entity. The type Measure
    represents a dimensioned value;
  </li><li>
    Mixed unit arithmetic. Values in SI
    (<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/index.html">Le
    <b>S</b>ystème <b>I</b>nternational d'Unités</a>) units can
    be mixed with irregular units (such as foot and yard) as long as the result
    is defined;
  </li><li>
    Shifted unit support (a widely used instance of a shifted unit is degree
    of Celsius);
  </li><li>
    The type Measure is generic, parameterized by a floating-point type. A
    non-generic version based on the type Float is also provided;
  </li><li>
    String to Measure conversion supports as wide set of irregular units as 
	possible;</li><li>
    Currently the powers of the base unit components lie in the range -8..7. 
	This limitation has an implementation reason (absence of 64-bit modular 
	integers in some Ada compilers). For further discussion of this topic
    <a href="#64-bit">see</a>;</li><li>
	<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> widgets for a comfortable visual 
	measurement unit editing and selection. The rest of the library can be used 
	independently on this part as well as on <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>.</li></ul>

The units converter and mapper are small utilities provided as exercises to 
illustrate use 
of the software. The unit converter is a small dialog box where you can enter a 
dimensioned value and then convert it to SI. The unit mapper is a dialog box 
that converts value from one unit to another as you type it.
The source code is discussed in the section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a>.

Types</h2>
<p>
<a name="Measures"></a>
Two types are used for dealing with units. The type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a>
denotes the dimension of a physical entity. The type
<a href="#Measure">Measure</a> represents a dimensioned value it is defined in a
generic package <a href="#Measures">Measures</a> which is instantiated with the
desired floating-point type as the parameter:
</p><blockquote>
  <p><tt><span color="#0000FF">generic</span><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <span color="#0000FF">type</span> Number <span color="#0000FF"> is digits
  </span> &lt;&gt;;<br>
  <span color="#0000FF">package</span> Measures <span color="#0000FF"> is</span><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="Float_Measures"></a>The package <a href="#Float_Measures">Float_Measures</a>
is an instance of <a href="#Measures">Measures</a> for the standard Float type:
.
</p><p>
<a name="1.1"></a><a href="#1"><img src="http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/prev.gif" alt="[Back]" width="29" height="29"></a><a href="#6"><img src="http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/index.gif" alt="[TOC]" width="29" height="29"></a><a href="#1.2"><img src="http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/next.gif" alt="[Next]" width="29" height="29"></a></p><h3>1.1. The type Unit</h3>
<p><a name="Unit"></a><a name="Units"></a>The type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a> is defined in the package
<a href="#Units">Units</a>. A value
of the type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a> corresponds to a kind of physical entity,
like energy, charge or velocity. The package itself is rather useless, because
there are few things one can do with units. They are:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Exponentiation, the power is an integer;
  </li><li>
    Multiplication;
  </li><li>
    Division;
  </li><li>
    Square root;
  </li><li>
    Conversion to String.
</li></ul>
<p>
Or in Ada terms the following functions are defined:<br>
</p><blockquote>
  <tt><span color="#0000FF">function</span>
  "<span color="#FF0000">**</span>" (<b>Left</b> : Unit; <b>Right</b> : Integer)
  <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit; <br>
  <span color="#0000FF">function</span> "<span color="#FF0000">*</span>"&nbsp;
  (<b>Left</b>, <b>Right</b> : Unit) <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit;<br>
  <span color="#0000FF">function</span> "<span color="#FF0000">/</span>"&nbsp;
  (<b>Left</b>, <b>Right</b> : Unit) <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit;<br>
  <span color="#0000FF">function</span> Sqrt (<b>X</b> : Unit)
  <span color="#0000FF">return</span> Unit;</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Values of the type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a> build a group. A value of
<a href="#Unit">Unit</a> type can be viewed as an unordered set of seven
base components (mass, length, time, current etc.). Each component has
integer exponent part. The function Sqrt is defined for only units which
components have even exponent parts. The exception Constraint_Error is propagated
when the result of an operation is illegal.
</p><p>
The package also declares the exception Unit_Error and the type:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
  <tt>
  <span color="#0000FF"><a name="Units.Code_Set"></a>type</span> Code_Set <span color="#0000FF"> is</span>
  (ASCII_Set, Latin1_Set, UTF8_Set);</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the procedure:</p><blockquote>

Some words about the design. I didn't make the type <a href="#Unit">Unit</a>

<a href="#Measure">Measure</a> discriminated seems to be very important.
It allows to define subtypes of <a href="#Measure">Measure</a> with fixed

sake too, <a href="#Unit">Unit</a> is a modular number. As …</p></div>

    Performance is an important goal for pgagroal and effort have been made
    to make pgagroal scale and use a limited number of resources.
    </p><p>
    This report describe pgagroal in relationship to 3 other <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
    connection pool implementations, which we will call "a", "b" and "c".
    </p><p>
    The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgbench.html">pgbench</a> program was used in the runs. All pool
    configurations were made with performance in mind.
    </p><p>
    All diagrams are using the same identifier for the connection pool in question, so "a" is "a" in all
    diagrams and so on.
    </p><p>
    The runs were performed on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">RHEL</a> 7.7 /

I track my fitness, diet, sleep, mindfulness, mood, goals, good habits, bad habits, time spent, and personality traits.</p><p>For a full dive into how I started quantifying my life, the categories of data that I track, and the reasons why I do it, please check out <a href="https://dailyvis.com/posts/quantified-self-why-i-track-my-life-in-data/">my most recent post</a>.</p><h2>Why I analyze my quantified self data</h2><p>I don't collect data just for the sake of collecting data, trust me I have more interesting hobbies than that. I collect this data to discover meaningful relationships between the aspects of my life that I care about, and learn new things about myself that I can use for future decisions, both big and small.</p><p>Besides uncovering insights for future decision-making, it's just <em>fun</em>. I've always been a data-driven person, and have enjoyed visualizing data and finding the hidden meaning in it. It's one thing to experience that feeling on a data set, but a completely another one to have the data set be something that has such direct implications on your day-to-day.</p><p>Seriously, if you could answer questions like "What makes me happy?" or "When do I feel my most healthy?" in an objective and unbiased way, wouldn't you want to do that?</p><h2>The analysis that I do on my personal data</h2><ul><li><strong>Stats</strong>: Basic computations like <em>"Going to the gym 4 times a week on average"</em></li><li><strong>Trends</strong>: Movement of certain metrics over time, like <em>"Coffee consumption down 20% over the past year"</em></li><li><strong>Correlations</strong>: Calculating relationships between metrics, like <em>"On days you work out, your mood in the evening tends to be higher"</em></li><li><strong>Timespan Insights</strong>: Looking at a time range to find what makes it unique and answer questions like <em>"How has the COVID lockdown changed my day-to-day?"</em></li></ul><p>I'm going to focus on correlations today, mostly because I find them fascinating &amp; insightful, and they make some pretty charts that I'm excited to share with you.</p><h2>Poke around my data</h2><p>The following interactive visualizations contain about 3 years of my personal non-sensitive data. Select a metric that looks interesting to you and we can check it out.</p><h2>My self-analysis</h2><p>The data in the charts above is probably much more fascinating to me than to you, as it helps tell the story of the past couple of years of my life.</p><p>With that in mind, I've spent a lot of time diving into all of these correlations. Here are the top conclusions that I've come around to realizing.</p><h3>The metrics cluster up</h3><p>I've found "families" of metrics that tend to move together and often fall in the same category of "good" or "bad" metrics. For example, days/weeks when I don't eat a healthy diet, I'm much more likely to also be sleeping poorly, working out less, drinking more alcohol, and feeling worse about myself, all at the same time! Likewise, some of my good habits like doing yoga, meditating, flossing, eating healthy, are most likely to be recorded on the same day.</p><p>What can I say, I prefer to live life at either end of the extreme. It's not as fun in the middle!</p><p>Jokes aside, that's actually quite a valuable insight. Since recognizing this, I've gotten more serious about my morning routine, making sure I start the day off on the right foot.</p><h3>Not always clear what causes what</h3><p>Because of the above insight on metric clusters, I'm interested to see if there's a particular metric that could be the trigger for a "good" or "bad" cluster of data for the day. My current analysis just looks for correlation, but not causation, so I can't determine what those triggers might be... yet...</p><p>I'll be diving into that in a future analysis. If you're reading this and have some resources for me to look into to do a causal analysis, please reach out!</p><h3>Obvious vs surprising relationships</h3><p>I plugged in all of my data (77 metrics at the time) into my <a href="https://dailyvis.com/exploration/compare/">correlation notebook</a> and did the correlation analysis on the daily timeframe. Even when looking at the last year of data, and filtering for a p-value of &lt;= 0.05, I had <em>197 highly statistically significant relationships</em>.</p><p>Wow, that's a lot! I decided to cut it down to the top 50 from that set and analyze each one.</p><p>What I found was that some of them seemed "obvious" because they were very clearly related (like going to the gym and exercise time for the day, or time awake in the morning and total time asleep that night), but there is a fair share of them that surprised me.</p><p>30 of the top 50 relationships were directly linked to one another, while the other <strong>20 of 50 relationships were insightful</strong>, and showed me relationships between my data that I wouldn't have assumed without this type of analysis.</p><h3>The insightful relationships</h3><p>The "obvious" relationships wouldn't be very fun to talk about, but here are the top 20 insightful relationships that I found:</p><ul><li>When <b>Anxiety</b> is up, <b>Confidence</b> is <b>down</b></li><li>When <b>Sleep quality</b> is up, <b>Mood in the morning</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Athleticism</b> is up, <b>Confidence</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Drank Alcohol</b> is up, <b>Spent time with <em>unnamed friend</em></b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Kind to people</b> is up, <b>Confidence</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Ate Veggies</b> is up, <b>Worked out</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Spent time with the girlfriend</b> is up, <b>Drank Alcohol</b> is <b>down</b></li><li>When <b>Drank Alcohol</b> is up, <b>Consumed Dairy</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Flossed Teeth</b> is up, <b>Early Night</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Used marijuana</b> is up, <b>Audiobook</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Used marijuana</b> is up, <b>Worked out</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Had Sex</b> is up, <b>Sleep quality</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Worked on side projects</b> is up, <b>Felt Humble</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Ate Veggies</b> is up, <b>Worked out</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Meditated</b> is up, <b>Felt Brave</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Work-life balance</b> is up, <b>Consumed Bread</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Spent time with the girlfriend</b> is up, <b>Coffee Consumption</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Spent time with the girlfriend</b> is up, <b>Ate Veggies</b> is <b>up</b></li><li>When <b>Flossed Teeth</b> is up, <b>Money spent on Alcohol</b> is <b>down</b></li><li>When <b>Drank Alcohol</b> is up, <b>Did Yoga</b> is <b>down</b></li></ul><h2>Applications of correlation analysis</h2><p>As you can see from the relationships above, there's a mixed bag of insights.</p><p>Some are logical, some confirm the consequences of good or bad habits, some point to habits that are proven to make me feel a certain way. And some, they are just plain funny (don't worry <em>unnamed friend</em>, we can still hang out even though you're a bad influence on me. You know who you are).</p><p>For those that are into biohacking or experimentation, this kind of analysis can be quite revealing to see the effects of those experiments. One QS community member even <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/blog/ari-meisel-on-curing-the-incurable-through-self-experimentation/">cured himself of Crohns disease</a> by experimenting with various supplements, nutrition, and fitness regiments, and correlating those experiments with his symptoms.</p><h2>What's next for me</h2><p>This analysis has truly been a ton of fun to do, and it's inspired me to keep on digging into my data. Here's my gameplan for the next couple of analyses and write-ups.</p><ul><li><strong>Integrated Data</strong>: This whole data set is manually tracked, but I'm going to be extracting some other interesting Fitness, Time, Music, and Productivity data to add to the mix.</li><li><strong>Before/After</strong>: These correlations would only compare the current day/week/month/year against the same timeframe in other metrics. I'm planning on expanding that to answer questions like - "When I make this decision today, what will be the effect tomorrow?"</li><li><strong>Clustering</strong>: As I mentioned, some of these metrics appear to move together. I'm going to be making a fancy cluster visualization to see the relationships all in one place.</li><li><strong>Causal</strong>: Instead of just looking for correlations, I'm going to see if any metrics might be the originating factor for other behaviors. </li><li><strong>Aggregations</strong>: I track 20 different metrics that are diet-related, but individually those don't tell me how my diet is doing overall. I'll be experimenting with a way to normalize and combine different kinds of data streams into one easy to digest metric.</li><li><strong>Timespan Insights</strong>: The analysis we did here today was one where we zoomed out and looked at relationships. The timespan insight would be the opposite, where we zoom in on a period of time and visualize discrepancies and differences between the rest of the data.</li></ul><p>If you enjoyed this post and are interested in future writings and online visualization tools, feel free to <a href="https://dailyvis.com/subscribe/">drop your email here</a> and I'll let you know when they are up.</p><h2>Have data of your own that you would like to visualize?</h2><p>If you have your own self-tracked data (in a CSV format) that you'd like to do similar correlation analysis for, you can do so on this site! Check out <a href="https://dailyvis.com/exploration/compare/">this data exploration notebook</a> for a fun and insightful time!</p></section></section></article></div></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>TL;DR: I have made my own WebGL framework, and it’s called Glii.</p>

<hr>

<p>It should be no secret that I have <a href="https://ivan.sanchezortega.es/devel/2019/02/14/a-rant-about-webgl-frameworks.html">strong opinions about WebGL frameworks</a>. So in true <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-going-to-build-my-own-theme-park-with-blackjack-and-hookers">Bender «I’ll make my own, with blackjack and hookers» spirit</a>, I’ve made my own. Save the blackjack and hookers, mind you.</p>

<p>It’s safe to say this is the culmination of five years worth of thoughts. My debut into WebGL was in <a href="https://www.mazemap.com/">MazeMap</a> (late 2015, I think), when I was in charge of speeding up the map rendering, after kinda giving up and submitting to <code>mapboxl-gl-js</code>. I tried to learn all I could, and I even created something dubbed <code>Leaflet.GL</code> that, sadly, after 3 or 4 full refacors, never saw the light.</p>

<p>Those refactors were whole mistakes. Luckily, I learned quite a lot from those mistakes.</p>

<p>The most important thing I learned is that WebGL was designed for C people and made by C people for C people. That means it was <strong>not</strong> designed, nor made by, nor made for, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> people, nor <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> people.</p>

<p>One big obvious thing to notice is that the WebGL API mimicks to perfection the OpenGL API (OpenGL ES 2.0 API, to be exact).</p>

<p>Another big couple things to notice (but only noticeable becuase I did some C back in my university freshman days) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> lacks a counterpart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">C’s <code>struct</code></a></li>
  <li>Therefore, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> lacks a counterpart to C’s <code>struct[]</code> (an array of <code>struct</code>s)</li>
  <li>The memory layout of vertex attributes (as forced by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer"><code>vertexAttribPointer()</code></a>) fits a <code>struct[]</code> <strong>perfectly</strong></li>
  <li>Therefore, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> doesn’t have a straightforward way to deal with vertex attributes</li>
</ul>

<p>So WebGL is a <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> API port of a C API… that works with C data types/structures that are not available in <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In hindsight, and <em>from the point of view of a web developer</em>, this seems like a huge architectural oversight.</p>

<p>Let me remark the «<em>from the point of view of a web developer</em>» bit. I’m sure the folks that designed WebGL had good reasons for the design, and had time constraints, and had compatibility constraints, and a hundred other things that made the API take its form. But at this point, I bet that ease of use by <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>/<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> people was not a (significant) factor.</p>

<p>I like to sum up that in one phrase:</p>

<p><strong>WebGL was never about bringing OpenGL to web developers; it was about bringing OpenGL developers to the web.</strong></p>

<p>As a <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>+<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> person, it’s mind-bogglinly complex to get into WebGL. <em>However</em>, since the APIs are practically carbon copies, an OpenGL person could get into WebGL straight away - reusing formatted data (models, meshes) that can be fetched over the network and copy-pasting away chunks of C code.</p>

<p>Fast-forward my thoughts, and you’ll reach the conspiracy theorist part of my brain that thinks WebGL was a ploy by Google to bring 3D-ish Google Maps to Chrome <em>and nothing else</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, another thing that makes me mad is the way WebGL tries to be object-oriented (since everything in <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> is an <code>Object</code> that has a <code>prototype</code>), but fails miserably to provide any kind of object-orientation-derived convenience. Instead, we’ve got freaking pointer logic in <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate. Let’s assume we have our GL stuff initialized, get a texture, change some properties of that texture, and dump an image into it.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>+<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> developer would dream of a <em>sane</em> way to do this, which would look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>glContext</span><span>.</span><span>createTexture</span><span>();</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>setParameter</span><span>(</span><span>'wrapS'</span><span>,</span> <span>'repeat'</span><span>)</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>fromImage</span><span>(</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-img'</span><span>)</span> <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead, we got this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createTexture</span><span>();</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let me comment on the <em>seemingly</em> idiotic code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// So far, so good</span>
<span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createTexture</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Set the value of the "currently bound 2D texture" pointer to the texture</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bindTexture</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span> <span>myTexture</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Set a texture parameter (given some integer constants), not of to the (un)given texture,</span>
<span>// but of the texture pointed by the "bound 2D texture" pointer</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>texParameteri</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_WRAP_S</span><span>);</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>texImage2D</span><span>(</span>
	<span>// Dump the `ImageData` of a `HTMLImageElement` into the texture currently pointed by</span>
	<span>// the "bound 2D texture" pointer.</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TEXTURE_2D</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Affect only the mipmap level 0. This would be a sane thing to specify, if</span>
	<span>// the MIN_FILTER parameter of the texture were using mipmaps.</span>
	<span>0</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Set the format of the texture to RGBA. This is kinda sane, since dumping data</span>
	<span>// into a texture might drop some of the data to make the texture size smaller in memory</span>
	<span>// e.g. ignoring the alpha channel of fully-opaque images</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>RGBA</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Repeat the format, since the WebGL API literally forces this parameter to have</span>
	<span>// the same value of the previous parameter instead of providing overloads.</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>RGBA</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// Specify the byte length of the image data, compeltely ignoring the fact that the</span>
	<span>// JS `ImageData` interface (and `HTMLImageElement`, and `BitmapImage`) can only be</span>
	<span>// 8-bits (one byte) per channel.</span>
	<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>BYTE</span><span>,</span>

	<span>// And the `HTMLImageElement` reference.</span>
	<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-img'</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The more time I’ve spent with this, the more idiotic is <em>seems</em>. Again, this is from the point of view of a web developer, with special emphasis on the «<em>from the point of view of a web developer</em>» bit. I do guess that this makes sense to low-level C+OpenGL people somehow.</p>

<p>The prize to the most <em>seemingly</em> idiotic part of the API, however, goes to parameters that must be zero. From the <code>texImage2D</code> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><code>border</code></strong>
    A <code>GLint</code> specifying the width of the border. Must be 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen, I’ve used a fair amount of APIs during my career. I’ve done <abbr title="Unified Modelling Language">UML</abbr>, I’ve read <em>design patterns</em>, I’ve created my fair amount of documented interfaces and APIs. And if I set aside my humility for a second, I can honestly say that <strong>having a public API require a parameter, and then force the users to always, unconditionally set that parameter to zero</strong> (or any other given static value) <strong>without explaining a good reason for that parameter to exist in the first place is utterly stupid</strong>.</p>

<p>Y’a know, at least slap “legacy” or “reserved for future use” in there.</p>

<p>But yeah, the more I’ve been dabbling with WebGL over the years, the more its API has begun <em>reeking</em> of C. I really mean no disrespect to the architects of OpenGL ES 2.0… but at the same time I cannot help but feel the <em>reek</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not even going to comment on the death of Flash and how HTML5+WebGL has failed to appeal to non-technical people, and why all artsy game devs are using Pico8 and Unity.</p>

<p>So, frameworks.</p>

<p>There have been a number of WebGL-based framweorks over the years. The most current list I could find is <a href="https://gist.github.com/dmnsgn/76878ba6903cf15789b712464875cfdc">in this gist</a> by <a href="https://dmnsgn.me/">Damien Seguin</a>, and it lists about 80 frameworks, toolkits, engines and frameworks.</p>

<p>And yet, none of them fulfill my needs.</p>

<p>Yes, it can be said that I have <em>special</em> needs. My WebGL career has been mostly failing to deliver <code>Leaflet.GL</code>, then doing all kinds of experiments on <code>Leaflet.TileLayer.GL</code>, failing to understand the overly complex architecture of <code>mapbox-gl-js</code> (now <code>maplibre-gl-js</code>), wondering about the OpenLayers abstractions for stitching tiles and reprojection, and creating the OpenLayers <code>GlTiles</code> data source (to replicate and expand the functionality of <code>Leaflet.TileLayer.GL</code>). This means I have a very specific set of requirements in a WebGL framework/toolkit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to all the low-ish level functionality
    <ul>
      <li>Things like <code>Float32</code> textures</li>
      <li>Do not assume 3D, no transformation/projection/scene matrices by default</li>
      <li>No implicit render loop</li>
      <li>This requirement disqualifies all 3D/game engines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Actual <abbr title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> wrappers over GL concepts like textures, programs and framebuffers
    <ul>
      <li>This disqualifies most microframeworks and toolsets.</li>
      <li>At this point, I’m basically left with regl and luma.gl only.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No dragging around the <code>WebGLRenderingContext</code>
    <ul>
      <li>regl fails to deliver this <em>just about</em>.</li>
      <li>luma.gl fail to deliver this in a spectacular way, since it does provide lifetime/renderloop functionality but forces the developer to carry around the raw instance of <code>WebGLRenderingContext</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Semi-sane equivalent of a C <code>struct[]</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This was the reason <code>Leaflet.GL</code> development sucked 3 to 4 days every time I wanted to change <em>one</em> data structure</li>
      <li>No, luma.gl, <a href="https://luma.gl/docs/api-reference/webgl/accessor"><code>Accesor</code></a> misses the point.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tooling for <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> project sucks. I do not want to spend 10 seconds since saving a file to being able to see the results in a web browser. That means no typescript, and no bundling (no rollup, no webpack, no parcel).
    <ul>
      <li>luma.gl particularly sucks at this point, since its “hello world” <em>requires</em> a webpack toolchain.</li>
      <li>The pre-rollup times of Leaflet (the <code>debug/include-browser.js</code> times) were awesome in a way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>… So. After <em>lots</em> of thinking and <em>lots</em> of learning from failures and a crystal-clear vision of how I wanted a WebGL API to be, and after a good couple of years worth of letting the ideas brew, I’ve done my own WebGL framework.</p>

<p>It’s called <strong>Glii</strong>, and I think it’s awesome. The name is homophonous with <strong>glee</strong>, because I can finally quickly prototype low-ish level GL algorithms and structures and be happy at the same time. I should create a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym">backronym</a> for it, like “GL Ivan’s Interface” or something.</p>

<p>Remember the texture example code from before? This is how it looks in Glii right now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>GLFactory</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'glii/index.mjs'</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>glii</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GLFactory</span><span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-canvas'</span><span>));</span>
<span>let</span> <span>myTexture</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>glii</span><span>.</span><span>Texture</span><span>();</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>wrapS</span> <span>=</span> <span>glii</span><span>.</span><span>REPEAT</span><span>;</span>
<span>myTexture</span><span>.</span><span>texImage2D</span><span>(</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my-img'</span><span>)</span> <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It just <em>makes sense</em>. It wraps GL concepts in a <abbr title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> fashion; I can forget about the <code>WebGLRenderingContext</code> entirely (because of some <em>clever</em> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">closure</a> bits); and since <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_script_type_module">browser support for <code>&lt;script type=module&gt;</code></a> is mature enough, no bundling is needed.</p>

<p>And the preliminary <abbr title="Unified Modelling Language">UML</abbr> class diagrams (generated via <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leafdoc">Leafdoc</a> and <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>) are a thing of beauty IMO:</p>

<p><img src="https://ivan.sanchezortega.es/img/2021-01-glii/class-diagram.dot.png" alt="Class diagram"></p>

<p><strong>Look at it</strong>. There’s no gigantic class, there are subclasses of stuff for convenience, there’s inheritance and composition and abstract classes, and I can finally understand <code>FrameBuffer</code>s from there.</p>

<p>And this …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A curious quality of SREs is that academia didn’t prepare them for a role in this field. Instead, you find former software developers who found joy in preventing system outages. Others found downtime so reprehensible that they dedicate their careers to preventing it.<br></p><p>I began my career as an Embedded Systems developer with a background in Electrical Engineering. Uptime wasn’t in my vernacular yet, but if my program exited unexpectedly, the device would just turn off. I’d have to hope my mistake was recoverable by a power cycle, so the criticality of uptime was already in my blood by the time I transitioned into SRE.<br></p><p>A few years and a career change later, I worked as a backend developer at a startup. My day-to-day included building features, deploying our application on-premise with customers and managing a cloud deployment of our own. Building product features was rewarding, but allowing product development velocity to grow without impacting our customers was even more attractive to me.<br></p><p>In retrospect, I introduced Site Reliability Engineering techniques to the organization for more reasons than reliability alone. I wanted developers to trust that our automated tests would introduce the complexities of our production environments. With that trust, they could focus on building a great product and not infrastructure. Beyond reliability, I value fostering trust and engineering excellence, which I believe are the bedrock of innovation on any team.</p><h2>An SRE’s Growth Cycle</h2><p>Site Reliability Engineering is a discipline that leverages software engineering principles to solve infrastructure and operational problems. An SRE plays a complementary role in a modern web development team. Their expertise in reliable production systems manifests through tools, testing and deployment automation, and scalable system architecture. The approach to solving reliability is unique to each organization. There’s one thing everyone agrees on: doing it right requires organizational cooperation.<br></p><p>Building a reliable production system requires a breadth of knowledge that’s acquired through years of experience. These years of experience expose you to critical issues and the pain of managing brittle applications. Although, this time is important for growth as an SRE, because you learn a few things along the way:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>The importance of testing your features before you ship them</li><li>How to build features that work on your dev machine and for millions of users</li><li>How to log the right information to solve issues that only happen in production</li><li>How to set proper alerts if something goes wrong</li><li>How to identify and monitor important metrics<br></li></ul><p>At this point in your career, you identify as an SRE but reflect on how your “training” mostly consisted of identifying what’s broken and then building things to prevent anyone from repeating the same mistake. Tomorrow brings another incident and the cycle repeats.<br></p><p>The incident response and prevention cycle does lead to positive outcomes. The iterative process of identifying system weaknesses translates to addressing issues in order of criticality. Each solution improves architecture, code quality and test coverage. As a result, a monotonic increase in uptime. A key goal is to translate knowledge of edge cases and the quirks of a system into automated tests and informative monitoring. The reliability of an application matures in tandem with the engineers building it.<br></p><p>An unintended consequence of this “training process” is that we’ve all forgotten what it’s like to not be obsessed with reliability. The industry is full of incident-tested veterans, each with unique workflows and habits that reinforce constant learning. We’ve acquired knowledge that our teammates depend on. Our blind spot has become how to effectively share all of the knowledge we’ve spent years acquiring.<br></p><p>Luckily, we can rely on future innovations as a remedy.</p><h2>State of the Field</h2><p>Site Reliability Engineering has certainly blossomed in popularity and for good reasons. A few Google searches and you can read about the latest tech company to have downtime and its consequences in lost revenue. Slack lost 5% of revenue in Q2 of 2019 due to service outages – causing them to promise investors that this was a “one-time” issue. Zoom experienced a 3 hour outage in Q3 of 2020, at a period when the service hosted 300 million daily meeting participants. Spending the time and money to automate incident prevention is a no-brainer when the outcome has fiscal benefits!<br></p><p>As the field has grown, so has the amount of approaches to the software development life cycle within distributed systems. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of processes in the space that ultimately tie back to reliability:<br></p><p><strong>DevOps</strong>: A company-wide culture of high velocity application development and infrastructure management by consolidating the responsibilities into one team.<br></p><p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong>: The development practice of frequent and small code changes, with each change undergoing a suite of automated tests to ensure program correctness. And because changes are small, developer teams can avoid feature-branch integration frustrations.<br></p><p><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong>: The development practice where each code commit is deployed in production automatically. The practice extends to culture, where the teams are vigilant in bug prevention and test creation. Build your own safety net, because every PR commit meets the real-world.<br></p><div><p><strong>GitOps</strong>: A version-controlled approach to infrastructure management. Gone are the days of manipulating production environments manually. Instead, configuration and deployments changes endure the scrutiny of code review.</p></div><p><strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>: All infrastructure management and provisioning is maintained by configuration files in a version-controlled repository. Say goodbye to the admin console and say hello to repeatable infrastructure provisioning.<br></p><p><strong>Chaos Engineering</strong>: The practice of systematically breaking things to improve team preparedness and system reliability. Introduce “chaos” outside of production so developers can write more resilient code and practice incident response.<br></p><p>Observe how all of the described approaches require company-wide participation. As much as we SREs feel like heroes day-to-day, Site Reliability isn’t a solitary job. Additionally, the industry has shown willingness to invent and adopt new techniques to address the perpetual challenge of keeping an application running smoothly. Adaptability is core to SRE DNA!</p><h2>Improved Collaboration with (Micro)Service Catalogs</h2><p>While SREs have proven to be adept at generating processes that make their company resilient, there is plenty of problem space yet unsolved. One topic comes to mind: knowledge transfer.<br></p><p>I recently onboarded at <a href="https://www.effx.com/">effx</a>, the company with a mission to solve this very issue. The stack is a collection of microservices hosted in Kubernetes and other workloads managed across different cloud providers. The code spread across different repositories, each with a designated responsibility. <em>How can I quickly learn how the system is supposed to work and integrate myself into the same workflow that my new team has spent years perfecting?</em><br></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/effx/why-nows-the-time-for-a-new-service-catalogue-dde39acdadc8">A (micro)service catalog solves all those problems.</a> It’s purpose is to aggregate online resources relevant to a service into a single pane of glass. Every resource a developer needs like service metadata, API documentation, troubleshooting tips, service architecture, runbooks, team ownership and contact information, repository links should be found here.<br></p><p>With service catalogs, new hires have a place to explore the code, runbooks and team ownership information to learn how the system works and who to contact with questions. The seasoned SREs have a place to share what they’ve learned with the rest of the team. And those tasked with on-call duty can quickly navigate incident response with troubleshooting tips of each service. The team works together to keep their collective knowledge in sync.<br></p><p>I grew into an SRE through a passion for building dependable systems that allow for innovation. The beauty of SRE comes from the synergy it brings into any company’s engineering practices. With effective inter-team collaboration, service outages can be avoided without sacrificing development velocity. Looking ahead, these values are why service catalogs excite me. They will help increase new engineers onboarding velocity while facilitating company-wide participation in crucial knowledge that has otherwise been hard to distribute.</p><p>If you're curious and want to take effx for a spin, <a href="https://app.effx.com/sign_up">try it here for free.</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

           <p><span><span>By <a href="https://blog.starburstdata.com/author/justin-borgman">Justin Borgman</a></span><span>6, Jan 2021</span></span>
         </p></div><div>
                <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>I’m excited to announce that Starburst has raised $100M in Series C financing, led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Salesforce Ventures, along with our existing investors Index Ventures and Coatue. I would like to sincerely thank everyone who helped make this possible: Our customers, partners, investors, advisors, and most of all, our all-star employees. We can't wait to continue our journey, starting with our first virtual industry conference Datanova, happening February 9th and 10th. If you haven't already registered, it's not too late! You can do so <a href="https://events.bizzabo.com/268317?promo=SCB&amp;tr=true" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<!--more-->
<p>After bootstrapping the company to profitability for the first two years without any outside capital, we have now raised over $164M in the last 12 months. That begs the question, <strong>why have we raised so much money so quickly?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, we believe we are solving the biggest problem that the big data era couldn’t: Offering fast access to data, regardless of where it lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stated another way, we provide data warehousing-style analytics, <strong>without the data warehouse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stop moving data and start using it.</strong></p>
<p>For decades, database vendors have played a dirty trick on you.&nbsp; “Store your data in my database and I’ll give you fast access to that data.”&nbsp; Well, the trouble with that approach is that the more successful you are in migrating all of your data into one single database, the more your database vendor has you locked in.&nbsp; Over time, that vendor starts to turn the screws on you and prices get out of control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the idea of storing all of your data in one place is an impossible goal.&nbsp; Different departments will make their own technology decisions and you’ll acquire companies and inherit their own database decisions. Most importantly, you’ll intentionally choose the right database for the job.&nbsp; Maybe it’s Databricks for training machine learning models and Confluent for streaming data.&nbsp; All of these natural forces combine to create unavoidable data silos.</p>
<p>That’s where Starburst comes in.&nbsp; We turn the enterprise data warehouse model on its head.&nbsp; Instead of ETL pipelines making endless copies of data and moving them around into a hopeless “single source of truth”, we allow a single point of access that provides incredibly fast analytics across all of the data that you own.</p>
<p>That last part is important: YOU own your data, not Starburst.&nbsp; YOU have the freedom to decide where it’s stored.&nbsp; Is that an RDBMS? Hadoop? Amazon S3? Google GCS? Azure ADLS? IBM COS? RedHat Ceph? Minio? Databricks? Snowflake? The list goes on and on, but the point is it’s YOUR CHOICE.</p>
<p>We call that the power of <a href="https://blog.starburstdata.com/technical-blog/the-power-of-optionality-in-big-data"><span>Optionality</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do we do it?</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been following Presto for a while, you already know us.&nbsp; Our team includes <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/press-releases/original-presto-cocreators-reunite-on-the-starburst-technical-leadership-team/"><span>all 4 of the Presto creators</span></a> along with the leading contributors to the project throughout it’s 8-year history.&nbsp; PrestoSQL recently changed its name to <a href="http://trino.io/"><span>Trino</span></a>, but the software is still the same.<span></span></p>
<p>Starburst Enterprise is an enterprise-grade distribution of the open source project that is used by hundreds of customers today, including data-driven companies like Comcast, Tesla, FINRA, and Zalando. It includes extra enterprise features that improve performance, security, connectivity, and manageability, along with 24x7 support from the Presto (and Trino!) experts.</p>

        <p><strong><span>TL</span>;<span>DR</span></strong> - I’ve decoded (most of) the protocol that the Peloton bike uses to
communicate with its head unit tablet and built a device, the PeloMon, that takes that
data during a ride, without interfering with the Peloton software, to
broadcast it over Bluetooth <span>LE</span> to whatever devices you’d like — a watch, Zwift,
Wahoo, whatever. Stick around for logic analyzer traces, hardware diagrams,
cursing at Bluetooth, and some nice&nbsp;interfaces.</p>

<p>We have a Peloton at home. Originally, I was skeptical, but then I found
trainers I like and it’s fun to ride with friends. And really takes the edge
off all-day Zoom meetings to ride during a meeting with the camera turned&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>But, being the guy that I am, I’ve been curious about how the head unit —
which runs a lightly skinned Android — was collecting stats
from the actual bike. I was also a bit annoyed that though the Peloton software
will happily read data from an <span>HR</span> sensor, and will upload your ride data to
Strava, there was no way for it to <em>broadcast</em> data about a ride to a local
fitness appliance — which meant that although I could track the fact that I
was doing an “indoor bike” ride on my Garmin watch, the watch would see a 0
mile ride because it got no bike&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Then a couple months ago, I came across
<a href="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/">this blog post</a>
in which someone on the Internet was able to hook up their (bricked) Flywheel
bike to Zwift using a Raspberry Pi to decode the bike sensor data and broadcast
it over Bluetooth — and I was inspired to finally give this project a shot.
What should we call a device broadcasting stats from the Peloton, monitoring it
if you will? How about&nbsp;“PeloMon”?</p>
<p>Let’s get down to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There are only two cables that plug into the tablet: a barrel jack carrying
<span>DC</span> power @ 12V (coming from the power brick), and a <span>TRRS</span> connector —
think “stereo aux cable”. So the data is clearly coming in on the latter.
Since I only wanted to observe the traffic between the <span>HU</span> and the bike,
not interrupt it, I used a headphone splitter cable to split the cable from the bike with an extra jack, and connected an aux cable from that extra jack
to the breakout. Such a connection might disrupt some high-speed communications
protocols, but my guess was that a) there wasn’t going to be that much traffic
to require anything fancy, b) nothing fast would be running over 3.5mm <span>TRRS</span>, and
c) this interface would be engineered with pretty wide tolerances for stability 
in a home environment. (Spoiler alert: all of these were&nbsp;true.)</p>
<p>The first step was to identify the pinout from the jack as best
as possible. Probing the leads with a <span>DMM</span> with the bike active showed that
Ring2 was at ground (0V with respect to the power supply’s ground)
with -5.5-6V between tip or ring1 and ground. Sleeve also appears to be
at ground, but it and Ring2 may not quite be the same (more on this later).
The negative voltages with respect
to ground are a pretty strong sign that we’re going to see <span>RS</span>-232&nbsp;signaling.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer"><a href="#decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer">Decoding the wire protocol with a logic&nbsp;analyzer</a></h2>
<p>(If you’d like to load a PulseView trace to see the data for yourself, one session
file from a test ride is located in <code>peloton_decoding/resistance-stepped-10s.sr</code>
in <a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">the PeloMon GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Normally I’d wire up the breakout and hack something together on the Arduino
I have sitting around, but it turns out that logic analyzers have gotten
<em>really really cheap</em> so I splurged on a $12.50 one and thought I’d give it
a whirl — turned out to be a great idea that made it <span>WAY</span> easier to decode
the signals. With complete abandon regarding ground isolation and the voltage
tolerances of the <span>LA</span> (is it supposed to be able to handle negative voltage?),
I hooked it up to see what I’d get. These cheapo LAs emulate a Saleae Logic
analyzer and work fine in the open-source <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView">PulseView</a>&nbsp;software.</p>
<p><img alt="Hooking up the LA with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and GND on ring2" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-4ring1-5sleeve-gndring2.png">
</p><center><strong>Hooking up the <span>LA</span> with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and <span>GND</span> on ring2</strong></center>
<p><img alt="D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and GND on sleeve" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-2ring1-4ring2-gndsleeve.png">
</p><center><strong>D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and <span>GND</span> on sleeve</strong></center>
<p>There’s pretty clearly serial signaling going on over these wires! One
party seems to be sending requests on Tip every 100ms, and the other
party responds about a millisecond later on Ring1. While it wasn’t obvious
from the <span>DMM</span> whether signaling <span>GND</span> should be on Ring2 or Sleeve, from the <span>LA</span>
traces, it looks like there is less glitching on the response line if Ring2 is
used as <span>GND</span> - so we’ll do that. The narrow pulses are probably single bits,
so sampling at a high rate (a few hundred kHz) lets us measure the bit
rate as&nbsp;19200bps:</p>
<p><img alt="Counting samples in the LA shows a 19.2kHz signal" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-19200bps.png">
</p><center><strong>Counting samples in the <span>LA</span> shows a 19.2kHz signal</strong></center>
<p>PulseView also lets you add protocol decoders to particular wires. I put a <span>UART</span>
decoder on with D0 as “<span>RX</span>” and D4 as “<span>TX</span>”, and saw data, but with a ton of
low-level serial protocol errors. UARTs invert the signal going out on the wire
with the expectation that there will be another <span>UART</span> at the other end to
re-invert. Since we don’t have that second <span>UART</span>, we have to turn the “Invert <span>RX</span>”
and “Invert <span>TX</span>” options on in PulseView, and then we see clean data! I also
experimented with other serial options (data, parity, and stop bits), but the
first guess of 8N1 turned out&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p><img alt="Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-missing-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions</strong></center>
<p><img alt="Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-fixed-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!</strong></center>
<p>Following the data streams, we see that the data stream on the
Tip wire during a ride always consists of one of three different four-byte
packets, repeated round-robin every 100ms, with the responses on Ring1 to these
requests being longer, different in length depending on the request type, and
variable in content.
It seems likely then that the Tip shows us signaling from the head unit to the
bike, and Ring1 is the bike responding to the head unit with information
about variables like current speed, resistance, or power&nbsp;output.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, we’ve worked out the physical layer protocol for the Peloton
communications: <span>RS</span>-232 at 5.5V and 19200bps 8N1 encoding, with <span>HU</span>-to-bike
communications on Tip, bike-to-<span>HU</span> on Ring1, <span>GND</span> on Ring2, and something
ground-like on&nbsp;Sleeve.</strong></p>

<p>To investigate the encoding between the head unit and the bike, I used the
logic analyzer to capture a trace of the communications during a ride. (Shoutout
to Ben Alldis and his Ministry of Sound ride series!)
The data dump and scripts are available in the GitHub repository for this project
at https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon/, in the <code>peloton_decoding</code> subdirectory.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-packet-structure"><a href="#basic-packet-structure">Basic packet&nbsp;structure</a></h2>
<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decoder_plots.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>During a ride, about every 100ms (100.66-100.8ms) the <span>HU</span> sends a request
to the bike, and the bike responds about 300us (i.e., 0.3ms) from the end
of the <span>HU</span>’s request. The <span>HU</span> sends three different request packets round robin.
Each request type has a different response length from the&nbsp;bike:</p>
<table> 
<tbody><tr><th><span>HU</span> Request</th><th>Bike Response Length</th><th>Example Bike Response</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 41 36 F6</tt></td><td>8 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 41 03 30 30 30 C5 F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 44 39 F6</tt></td><td>10 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 44 05 30 30 30 30 30 2A F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 4A 3F F6</tt></td><td>9 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 4A 04 38 36 36 30 13 F6</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A few things are evident from simple inspection of the&nbsp;bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first byte is a header - seems to be F5 from the <span>HU</span> and F1 from the&nbsp;bike.</li>
<li>All packets end in&nbsp;F6.</li>
<li>The second byte that the <span>HU</span> sends seems to be a request type, and is mirrored in the second byte in the bike’s&nbsp;response.</li>
<li>The third byte of the bike response is the length of the full packet minus 5 — probably indicates the length of the data payload following&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Serial packets often carry a checksum, and here the second-to-last byte from either the <span>HU</span> or the bike seems to be that: it’s the sum (modulo 256) of all the bytes preceding&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the packet format seems to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HU</span>: <code>F5 [request type] [checksum] F6</code></li>
<li>Bike: <code>F1 [request type] [payload length] [response bytes 1-n] [checksum] F6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can now throw together a quick plot of each response byte to look for&nbsp;patterns.</p>
<p><img alt="Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-bytewise.png">
</p><center><strong>Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride</strong></center>
<p>It appears that every byte ranges from 0x30 to 0x39 — which is exactly the
<span>ASCII</span> range for decimal digits 0 through 9. Furthermore, the earlier bytes in
each packet appear to vary more quickly than the later ones through a ride,
suggesting that the least-significant digit comes first. <strong>The Peloton bike
is encoding its responses as little-endian <span>ASCII</span> digits.</strong> It’s easy enough
to dump a plot of these values per response type now that we know the&nbsp;encoding:</p>

<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decode_resistance.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Glancing at these graphs it’s pretty clear that we have ride data of the Peloton
trifecta — cadence, power, and resistance — with a couple weird things thrown in
for flavor. Comparing to the Peloton ride stats, <strong>request type 0x41 seems to directly
return cadence in rpm and request type 0x44 returns 10 times power in watts (i.e.,
current power output in deciwatts)</strong>. However, while the …</p></div></div>

I started my career with punch cards and I am ending in the era of cloud computing. Despite all this change, many principles that have helped me throughout my career haven’t changed and continue to be relevant. As I step away from the keyboard, I want to share six ideas I’ve learned from my career as a software engineer.</p><h2>1. Beware of the Curse of Knowledge</h2><p>When you know something it is almost impossible to imagine what it is like&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to know that thing. This is the curse of knowledge, and it is the root of countless misunderstandings and inefficiencies. Smart people who are comfortable with complexity can be especially prone to it!</p><p>If you don’t guard against the curse of knowledge it has the potential to obfuscate all forms of communication, including code. The more specialized your work, the greater the risk that you will communicate in ways that are incomprehensible to the uninitiated. Fight the curse of knowledge. Work to understand your audience. Try to imagine what it would be like to learn what you are communicating for the first time.</p><h2>2. Focus on the Fundamentals</h2><p>Technology constantly changes, but some fundamental approaches to software development transcend these trends. Here are six fundamentals that will continue to be relevant for a long time.</p><ul><li><strong>Teamwork</strong>&nbsp;— Great teams build great software. Don’t take teamwork for granted.</li><li><strong>Trust&nbsp;</strong>— Teams move at the speed of trust. Be the kind of dependable person you would want to work with.</li><li><strong>Communication</strong>&nbsp;— Communicate honestly and proactively. Avoid the curse of knowledge.</li><li><strong>Seek Consensus</strong>&nbsp;— Take the time to bring your whole team along. Let discussion and disagreement bring you to the best solution.</li><li><strong>Automated Testing</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp; Well-tested code allows your team to move fast with confidence.</li><li><strong>Clean, understandable, and navigable code and design</strong>&nbsp;— Think of the next engineer that will take over your code as your customer.&nbsp; Build code that your successor won’t have any trouble reading, maintaining, and updating.</li></ul><h2>3. Simplicity</h2><p>Fighting complexity is a never-ending cause. Solutions should be as simple as possible. Assume the next person to maintain your code won’t be as smart as you. When you can use fewer technologies, do so.</p><figure><blockquote><p><em>“A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”</em></p><p><cite><em>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</em></cite></p></blockquote></figure><h2>4. Seek First to Understand</h2><p>One of Stephen Covey’s seven habits is, “Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood.” This maxim has helped me more than any other advice to become a good listener and teammate. If you want to influence and work effectively with others, you first need to understand them. Actively listen to understand their feelings, ideas, and point of view before you begin trying to make your own thoughts known.</p><p><a href="http://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4305" data-permalink="https://www.bti360.com/what-ive-learned-in-45-years-in-the-software-industry/bti360-2019-237-2/" data-orig-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg" data-orig-size="600,388" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="bti360-2019-237" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237-400x259.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="388" srcset="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237.jpg 600w, https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237-400x259.jpg 400w, https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bti360-2019-237-564x365.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><h2>5. Beware of Lock-In</h2><p>There will always be the next hot productivity product that will promise to revolutionize how software is built. Computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools, COTS, Enterprise Resource Planning products like Peoplesoft and SAP and, yes, even Ruby. They claim amazing reductions in cost and time if you buy into their holistic development philosophy. What is not always as obvious is the significant up-front costs or the constraints you may be committing yourself to. Lock-in used to primarily happen with vendors, but now it can happen with frameworks too. Either way, lock-in means significant cost to change. Choose wisely. New is not always better!</p><h2>6. Be Honest and Acknowledge When You Don’t Fit the Role</h2><p>At some point in your career you may find yourself in a role that isn’t a good fit. A bad fit isn’t a character flaw, but it’s a problem you shouldn’t ignore. There may be more than one solution to such a dilemma: you can evolve or the role can evolve. The key is to have the self-knowledge to recognize what is happening and get yourself out of an unhealthy spot. Being unhappy is in no-one’s best interests, and BTI360 recognizes this.</p><p>When I was at GM, you were a failure if your next move was not&nbsp;<em>up</em>—managing more people or taking on bigger, more complex projects. For many, this made for a miserable career path (see the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle">Peter Principle</a>). At EDS, the culture wasn’t like this. People moved in and out of management roles. There was no stigma associated with moving from roles with greater scope, like strategic planner, to roles with more narrow scope, like PM or project-level developer. I was one of the people who took advantage of this flexibility, moving from a role at the top of the technical pyramid back to being a project-level developer. I never looked back.</p><h2>Final Thoughts<img data-attachment-id="4294" data-permalink="https://www.bti360.com/?attachment_id=4294" data-orig-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" data-orig-size="230,230" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" data-large-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" loading="lazy" src="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldberg_Joel_2_circ-230.png" alt="" width="230" height="230"></h2><p>Even before I joined BTI360 I knew enough about the culture to know that it was a place that valued the kinds of principles I’ve described above.

<p><span>W</span>hen Zeeshan and Imran Ali Khan moved to Pakistan in 2006 to set up an online real estate company, they didn’t really know what they were getting themselves into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back then, buying or selling a house in Pakistan was a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1322817">cash-heavy</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1570992">offline experience</a>. Internet penetration was about 6.5%, and there was little market transparency — people lived in fear of unwittingly purchasing or renting houses on illegally occupied land. There were no trustworthy digital real estate portals. But the brothers saw an opening. They were ambitious first-generation immigrants to the U.K. who had graduated with engineering degrees from Imperial College and Oxford and spent years launching online businesses from their London apartment.</p>



<p>By the time the brothers arrived in Lahore, they were seasoned entrepreneurs, having started a range of businesses in the early and late aughts, including an Alibaba-like e-commerce website, an air filter distribution company, and even a small gym. In 2006, along with their third brother, Haider, they set up Zameen, an online real estate service. This was the mid-2000s, and much of the property in Pakistan’s biggest cities was cartelized or controlled by the military. In parts of the country, the informal nature of ownership enabled the practice of <em>kabza, </em>the illegal occupation of land or housing by powerful locals. Low digital literacy rates made it difficult to reach potential buyers and sellers, and an underdeveloped payment infrastructure made things even more complicated. The simple idea of Craigslisting real estate meant overcoming a barrage of obstacles.</p>



<p>Now, 15 years later, the company claims to have 5.5 million monthly <a href="https://www.zameen.com/advertise/index.html">users</a> and has digitized more than a million land plots and housing units. Every month, it registers roughly 500,000 new listings, and local real estate agents estimate that 70% of all sale and rental transactions in Pakistan are initiated through<strong> </strong>Zameen, which means “land” in Urdu. More than that, however, the company transformed the way property sales work in Pakistan, the most urbanized country in South Asia. While the market used to be dominated by brokers who kept a tight grip on housing costs and availability, formerly private information is now available to everyone.</p>

<p>For the first six years of Zameen’s operation, the brothers were preoccupied with other businesses, and the country was dealing with its own problem: 2009<strong> </strong>was one of the bloodiest years on record for Pakistan. Terrorist attacks targeting civilians and security forces killed <a href="http://pakpips.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sr2008.pdf">3,021</a> people, according to the Pak Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS), and extremists controlled tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. At that point, Pakistan was among the <a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=35383">most dangerous countries</a> in the world, with thousands emigrating to the U.S., U.K., and Canada. To international investors, the founders struggled to dispel “this errant notion of [Pakistan] being a troubled place where nothing is flourishing,” as Zeeshan later explained. But the brothers continued to believe that the company could work.</p>



<p>Prior to Zameen, newspapers were the dominant medium for advertising real estate in Pakistan. Agents preferred an offline, person-to-person approach, as many had trouble using technology. “Zameen used to send SMS leads to agents,” said Zeeshan. “They would even struggle with using SMS properly.”</p>



<p>Quality control was another problem. Listings had to be manually checked for fakes and price gouging. Unlike in developed markets, in Pakistan “there are no safeguards like escrow account services and mandatory regulation to protect both consumers and developers,” says Umar Nadeem, a housing market expert at Islamabad-based think tank Tabadlab. As of December 2019, there were more than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1384319">1.8 million pending</a> court cases, many related to property disputes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, since 1990, Pakistan has been in the midst of a massive urban migration. A recent <a href="https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/2019-05/state_of_pakistani_cities_0.pdf">study</a> revealed that 10 cities account for 54% of the total urban population of 75 million. Around 2012, in the midst of this transition, owning property in urban areas became desirable. Interest was driven by wealthy expats buying properties back home, and sales were fueled by military-led housing projects and $70 billion in Chinese infrastructure investment. Nadeem estimates that parts of Karachi and Lahore saw <a href="https://www.tabadlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Designing-Affordable-Housing-Policy.pdf">the value of a plot of land rise by 400%</a> between 2008 and 2013. Hungry for quick returns, Pakistani buyers began aggressively flipping real estate, as an initial investment could be doubled within a few years. “Real estate, I don’t think it has had a bust cycle. It’s generally boomed over the years,” says Nadeem.</p>



<p>Zameen caught this wave. They ran local <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnR4V6sz8N0">television ads</a> targeting expats and diaspora Pakistanis. Noting an opportunity, the brothers closed most of their other businesses to focus on the site. “That was a great decision,” says Imran. By 2013, they’d signed up more than 3,000 real estate agencies across different states in Pakistan to provide them with listings. In out-of-the-way areas where brokers didn’t know how to use computers, they offered training and hired tech-savvy teenagers as “computer operators” to upload photos of properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To convince reluctant real estate agents to list properties on Zameen, the founders built a large, dispersed sales team across Pakistan. This had the effect of making Pakistan’s real estate market more open. People suddenly had access to available property listings, price estimates, and contacts for sellers —&nbsp;information that had previously been impossible to get without hiring brokers in local communities. By the end of 2012, Zameen had registered 65,000 listings; by 2016, they notched 20 million page views — even without the support of a robust technological infrastructure. “For payment collection, we would have to send someone to pick up the money,” Imran says. “There was no [online payment] service back in those days.” The benefits were immediate —&nbsp;Zameen became the only online source of information about Pakistani real estate anywhere in the world. In the early days, “if you wanted to look up anything about real estate in Pakistan, you really couldn’t look anywhere else,” says Farooq Tirmizi, a Pakistani entrepreneur based in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>But even though the company charged fees to sellers, this alone wasn’t lucrative enough. Nor was it standard in Pakistan to charge property management companies to advertise listings online. According to Zeeshan, while a real estate agency in Europe or the U.S. might spend up to 25% of its budget on marketing, in Pakistan, that figure is closer to 0.5%. And because Pakistanis typically pay for properties in cash, there were rarely any sales commissions. As a result of all this, Zameen struggled financially, even as its user base grew. In 2015, reports surfaced stating that the company only reached $1 million in revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the brothers pivoted. First, they began offering exclusive marketing deals to real estate developers, claiming that Zameen would “sell the property for you.” When a property did sell, the company often charged a sizable commission. Then, in 2018, the Khan brothers decided to become real estate developers themselves. They began co-developing properties with builders and hired a land-acquisition team to source plots, learn local bylaws, and work with architects. “That kind of control is key to operating in emerging markets that are informal and unregulated,” says Zeeshan. By 2019,&nbsp;revenue soared to more than <a href="https://aimgroup.com/2020/02/03/zameen-com-posts-8-5m-in-revenue-leads-fdvs-portfolio/">$30 million</a>. Today, in addition to initiating the majority of real estate transactions in Pakistan, Zameen sells its own buildings — as of June 2020, they had eight ongoing development projects.</p>

<p>Not everyone is pleased with the brothers’ new strategy. Brokers who shared details of their arrangements with Zameen allege that they were taken advantage of. For the brothers, entering the marketing and real estate development businesses was about taking greater “control” of its supply side. “Typically, if you are a global classified portal, by virtue of strong laws, you can operate smoothly as a middleman and get value for your services. [In Pakistan] the farther away you are from being in control, the more difficult it gets to manage your business,” Zeeshan says. No formal complaints have been filed against Zameen, but there is growing discontent among agents.</p>



<p>“It was good as long as they were a marketing [classified] platform, but now they have become real estate agents themselves, and that puts us at a serious disadvantage,” a Karachi-based agent who has been on Zameen for five years and did not want to be identified for fear of retribution told <em>Rest of World</em>. (There is no evidence of Zameen giving precedence to its own listings.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The allegations Zameen faces are similar to those battering many big Silicon Valley companies —&nbsp;Amazon <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015?mod=hp_lead_pos2">selling its own goods</a> after gathering data about other products sold within its marketplace, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c">Apple favoring its own apps</a> in App Store search results. But Haider, the eldest brother, is quick to dismiss these comparisons. “Solutions are supposed to strengthen the local economy,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “These brokers also make money.” Moreover, Haider says, given that Pakistan has a shortage of 10 million houses, more development is good for the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past year, local agents from Islamabad and Karachi have expressed concern that Zameen is abusing its position and called for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXcmwEn1uTE">boycott</a>. “They [Zameen] are using our data and now are doing their own marketing and sales,” a property dealer says in a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVGTH-ugZxw">video</a>. “We are handing our business to them,” he warns. Others have accused them of becoming an “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnxA6BHZnFk">online real estate mafia</a>.” When …</p></div></div>

January 6, 2021 | https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ShellPipesTwoUsages | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ShellPipesTwoUsages">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Unix shell pipelines have two usage patterns</h2>

	<p><small>January  6, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've seen a variety of recommendations for safer shell scripting
that use Bash and set its 'pipefail' option (for example, <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">this
one from 2015</a>).
This is a good recommendation in one sense, but it exposes a conflict;
this option works great for one usage pattern for pipes, and
potentially terribly for another one.</p>

<p>To understand the problem, let's start with what Bash's pipefail does.
To quote the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html">Bash manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command
in the pipeline, unless the <code>pipefail</code> option is enabled.  If
<code>pipefail</code> is enabled, the pipelineâ€™s return status is the value of
the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero
if all commands exit successfully. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason to use <code>pipefail</code> is that if you don't, a command failing
unexpectedly in the middle of a pipeline won't normally be detected
by you, and won't abort your script if you used '<code>set -e</code>'. You can
go out of your way to carefully check everything with <code>$PIPESTATUS</code>,
but that's a lot of extra work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is where <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/BashPipes">our old friend <code>SIGPIPE</code></a> comes into the picture. What <code>SIGPIPE</code> does
in pipelines is force processes to exit if they write to a closed
pipe. This happens if a later process in a pipeline doesn't consume
all of its input, for example if you only want to process the first
thousand lines of output of something:</p>


<blockquote><pre>generate --thing | sed 1000q | gronkulate
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>sed</code> exits after a thousand lines and closes the pipe that
<code>generate</code> is writing to, <code>generate</code> gets <code>SIGPIPE</code> and by default
dies, and suddenly its exit status is non-zero, which means that
with <code>pipefail</code> the entire pipeline 'fails' (and with '<code>set -e</code>',
your script will normally exit).</p>

<p>(Under some circumstances, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ShellPipelineIndeterminate">what happens can vary from run to run due
to process scheduling</a>. It can also depend
on how much output early processes are producing compared to what later
processes are filtering; if <code>generate</code> produces 1000 lines or less,
<code>sed</code> will consume all of them.)</p>

<p>This leads to two shell pipeline usage patterns. In one usage pattern,
all processes in the pipeline consume their entire input unless
something goes wrong. Since all processes do this, no process should
ever be writing to a closed pipe and <code>SIGPIPE</code> will never happen. In
another usage pattern, at least one process will stop processing its
input early; often such processes are in the pipeline specifically to
stop at some point (as <code>sed</code> is in my example above). These pipelines
will sometimes or always generate <code>SIGPIPE</code>s and have some processes
exiting with non-zero statuses.</p>

<p>Of course, you can deal with this in an environment where you're using
<code>pipefail</code>, even with '<code>set -e</code>'. For instance, you can force one
pipeline step to always exit successfully:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(generate --thing || true) | sed 1000q | gronkulate
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>However, you have to remember this issue and keep track of what commands
can exit early, without reading all of their input. If you miss some,
your reward is probably errors from your script. If you're lucky,
they'll be regular errors; if you're unlucky, they'll be sporadic errors
that happen when one command produces an unusually large amount of
output or another command does its work unusually soon or fast.</p>

<p>(Also, it would be nice to only ignore <code>SIGPIPE</code> based failures, not
other failures. If <code>generate</code> fails for other reasons, we'd like the
whole pipeline to be seen as having failed.)</p>

<p>My informal sense is that the 'consume everything' pipeline pattern
is far more common than the 'early exit' pipeline pattern, although
I haven't attempted to inventory my scripts. It's certainly the
natural pattern when you're filtering, transforming, and examining
all of something (for example, to count or summarize it).</p>

<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>prefetch<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/style.css<span>"</span></span> <span>as</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>style<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>preload<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/style.css<span>"</span></span> <span>as</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>style<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>preconnect<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>dns-prefetch<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>prerender<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/about.html<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

<p><code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code> tells the browser to download and cache a resource (like a script or a stylesheet) as soon as possible. It’s helpful when you need that resource a few seconds after loading the page, and you want to speed it up.</p>
<p>The browser doesn’t do anything with the resource after downloading it. Scripts aren’t executed, stylesheets aren’t applied. It’s just cached – so that when something else needs it, it’s available immediately.</p>
<h2 id="example"><a href="#example" aria-label="example permalink"></a>Example</h2>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>preload<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/style.css<span>"</span></span> <span>as</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>style<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>href</code> points to the resource you want to download.</p>
<p><code>as</code> can be anything you can download in a browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>style</code> for stylesheets,</li>
<li><code>script</code> for scripts,</li>
<li><code>font</code> for fonts,</li>
<li><code>fetch</code> for resources downloaded with <code>fetch()</code> or <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>,</li>
<li>other values – see the full list <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content#What_types_of_content_can_be_preloaded">on MDN</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to specify the <code>as</code> attribute – it helps the browser to prioritize and schedule the download properly.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use"><a href="#when-to-use" aria-label="when to use permalink"></a>When to use</h2>
<p><strong>Use it when you’ll need a resource soon.</strong> <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code> will help when you know you’ll need a resource soon after loading the page, and you want to start loading it earlier. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You use custom fonts. The <code>@font-face</code> rule that applies those fonts is in an external CSS file:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>stylesheet<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>index.css<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="css"><pre><code>
<span><span>@font-face</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>  src</span><span>:</span> <span><span>url</span><span>(</span>'comic-sans.woff2'<span>)</span></span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>'woff2'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By default, <code>comic-sans.woff2</code> will start downloading only when <code>index.css</code> is fetched and applied. Instead of waiting for it that long, use <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code> to initiate the download sooner:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>preload<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>comic-sans.woff2<span>"</span></span> <span>as</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>font<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You split your styles per <a href="https://3perf.com/talks/web-perf-101/#css-block-rendering-1">the Critical CSS approach</a>. With this approach, you’ll split your CSS into two parts – critical (required for immediate rendering) and non-critical:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  
  <span>loadCSS</span><span>(</span><span>'/app/non-critical.css'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this approach, non-critical styles will start downloading only when JavaScript starts executing – which can be a few seconds after the first render. Instead of waiting for JS to execute, use <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code> to initiate the download sooner:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>preload<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/app/non-critical.css<span>"</span></span> <span>as</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>style<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  
  <span>loadCSS</span><span>(</span><span>'/app/non-critical.css'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don’t overuse it.</strong> Preloading everything won’t magically speed up the site – instead, it will likely prevent the browser from scheduling everything smartly.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t confuse with <code>prefetch</code>.</strong> Don’t use <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code> if you don’t need a resource immediately after the page loads. If you only need it later – e.g., for a next page – use <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="more-details"><a href="#more-details" aria-label="more details permalink"></a>More details</h2>
<p><strong>It’s mandatory.</strong> Unlike all other preload-related <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags (except <a href="#modulepreload"><code>modulepreload</code></a>), this tag is mandatory for the browser (if it supports the tag). A browser <em>has</em> to download the resource specified in <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code>. With other tags described here, a browser is free to skip preloading the resource if it decides to – e.g. if the network is slow.</p>
<p><strong>Priorities.</strong> For different kinds of resources (styles, scripts, fonts, etc.), browsers typically assign different priorities. This allows for downloading the most important resources first. For a resource fetched with <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code>, browsers use the <code>as</code> attribute to determine its priority. For Chrome, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bCDuq9H1ih9iNjgzyAL0gpwNFiEP4TZS-YLRp_RuMlc/edit#">the full table of Chrome priorities</a> for more details</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>2) How I find what to preload:</p><p>— Go to DevTools and run a performance recording of how the page loads<br>— Scroll through the Network section and find stuff that blocks page rendering but gets downloaded too late (= too much down in Network section).

<p><code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code> asks the browser to download and cache a resource (like, a script or a stylesheet) in the background. The download happens with a low priority, so it doesn’t interfere with more important resources. It’s helpful when you know you’ll need that resource on a subsequent page, and you want to cache it ahead of time.</p>
<p>The browser doesn’t do anything with the resource after downloading it. Scripts aren’t executed, stylesheets aren’t applied. It’s just cached – so that when something else needs it, it’s available immediately.</p>
<h2 id="example-1"><a href="#example-1" aria-label="example 1 permalink"></a>Example</h2>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>prefetch<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/style.css<span>"</span></span> <span>as</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>style<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>href</code> points to the resource you want to download.</p>
<p><code>as</code> can be anything you can download in a browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>style</code> for stylesheets,</li>
<li><code>script</code> for scripts,</li>
<li><code>font</code> for fonts,</li>
<li><code>fetch</code> for resources downloaded with <code>fetch()</code> or <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>,</li>
<li>other values – see the full list <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content#What_types_of_content_can_be_preloaded">on MDN</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to specify the <code>as</code> attribute – it helps the browser to prioritize and schedule the download properly.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-1"><a href="#when-to-use-1" aria-label="when to use 1 permalink"></a>When to use</h2>
<p><strong>Use it for resources from other pages.</strong> <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code> will help if you need a resource on a different page, and you want to preload it and speed up rendering of that page. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have an e-commerce site, and 40% of your users go from the home page to a product page. Use <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code> to download CSS and JS files responsible for rendering product pages</li>
<li>You have a single-page app, and you code-split it so that different pages load different bundles. When a user visits some page, ask your router what other pages it links to, and use <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code> to preload bundles for those pages</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It’s probably safe to use it as much as you want.</strong> Browsers usually schedule prefetches with the lowest priority, so they don’t interfere with other resources. This means it’s probably safe to prefetch a lot of stuff. Keep in mind though that this will still use the user’s data – and there’s a chance that’ll cost them money!</p>
<p><strong>Don’t use for urgent resources.</strong> Don’t use <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code> when you’ll need a resource in a few seconds. In this case, use <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code> instead.</p>
<h2 id="more-details-1"><a href="#more-details-1" aria-label="more details 1 permalink"></a>More details</h2>
<p><strong>Not mandatory.</strong> The browser is <em>not</em> required to follow the <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code> instruction. This means it can decide not to fetch the resource – e.g. if the connection is slow.</p>
<p><strong>Priorities in Chrome.</strong> In Chrome, <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code> downloads are usually prioritized with the lowest priority (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bCDuq9H1ih9iNjgzyAL0gpwNFiEP4TZS-YLRp_RuMlc/edit">full table of priorities</a>). This means they are usually scheduled after everything else got loaded.</p>

<p><code>&lt;link rel="preconnect"&gt;</code> asks the browser to perform a connection to a domain in advance. It’s helpful when you know you’ll download something from that domain soon, but you don’t know what exactly, and you want to speed up the initial connection.</p>
<p>A browser has to set up a connection when it retrieves something from a new third-party domain. (A third-party domain is a domain that’s different from the one your app is hosted on.) This may happen when a site uses a font from Google Fonts, loads React from a CDN, or requests a JSON response from an API server.</p>
<p>Setting up a new connection typically takes several hundred milliseconds. It’s only needed once per domain, but it still takes time. If you set up a connection in advance, you’ll save that time and load resources from that domain faster.</p>
<h2 id="example-2"><a href="#example-2" aria-label="example 2 permalink"></a>Example</h2>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>preconnect<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://api.my-app.com<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>href</code> points to the server you want to connect to.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-2"><a href="#when-to-use-2" aria-label="when to use 2 permalink"></a>When to use</h2>
<p><strong>Use it for domains you’ll need shortly.</strong> <code>&lt;link rel="preconnect" /&gt;</code> will help you when you have an important style, script, or image on a third-party domain, but you don’t know the resource URL yet. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your app is hosted at <code>my-app.com</code>, and it makes AJAX requests to <code>api.my-app.com</code>. You don’t know what specific requests you’ll be making to that domain – because you make them dynamically from JS.</p>
<p>Use <code>&lt;link rel="preconnect"&gt;</code> to connect to <code>api.my-app.com</code> in advance and make the first data request faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your app is hosted at <code>my-app.com</code>, and it uses Google Fonts. Google Fonts load fonts in two stages: first, a CSS file is downloaded from <code>fonts.googleapis.com</code>; then, that CSS file requests fonts from <code>fonts.gstatic.com</code>.</p>
<p>You can’t know what specific font files from <code>fonts.gstatic.com</code> you’ll need until you download the CSS file from <code>fonts.googleapis.com</code>. Use <code>&lt;link rel="preconnect"&gt;</code> to set up a connection in advance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use it to slightly speed up some third-party script or style.</strong> If you have a third-party resource in the page that you really need to load sooner, add <code>&lt;link rel="preconnect" /&gt;</code> for that domain. It will instruct the browser to setup connection for that domain sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t overuse it.</strong> Setting up and keeping a connection open is costly – both for a client and a server. The simple rule of thumb is: use this tag for 4-6 domains at most.</p>
<h2 id="more-details-2"><a href="#more-details-2" aria-label="more details 2 permalink"></a>More details</h2>
<p><strong>Not mandatory.</strong> The browser is <em>not</em> required to follow a <code>&lt;link rel="preconnect"&gt;</code> instruction. This means it can decide not to set up a new connection – e.g., if there’re already …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In this blog post we’re going to look at performance profiling. What it is and how it works. This is the first post in our series on Profiling in Production, by the end of the series you’ll have an understanding of how profilers work, which ones are safe and efficient in production, how to read and interpret the data they produce and finally, how to use this knowledge to keep on top of performance.</p>
<p>So to kick things off, what exactly is profiling? Profiling is the measurement of which parts of your application are consuming a particular computational resource of interest. This could be which methods are using the most CPU time, which lines allocate the most objects, where your CPU cache misses are coming from, etc..</p>
<p>There are two predominant ways profilers are implemented. The first and earliest type are instrumenting profilers. They work by <em>instrumenting</em> the program under test in order to collect information about the resource of interest. For example if you wanted to calculate how much time methods were taking to execute an instrumenting profiler would add instructions to the beginning and end of each method to capture the current time which could then be used to reconstruct the duration spent inside each method.</p>
<p>The problem with instrumenting profilers is that the instrumentation code changes the behaviour of the program significantly and how the program is affected depends on its structure. Imagine two codebases performing the same functionality but with one with sprawling thousand line long methods and the other in many more small methods. For the method timing example earlier, the effect on the former codebase would be significantly different from that of the latter because it needs to run significantly more instrumentation code. This fundamental issue makes instrumenting profilers inaccurate. The instrumentation code also tends to slow the program down a lot  which has meant these types of profilers are not as dominant as they once were.</p>
<p>The most common type of profiler is the <em>sampling</em> profiler. They work by interrupting the application under test periodically in proportion to the consumption of the resource we’re interested in. While the program is interrupted the profiler grabs a snapshot of its current state, which includes where in the code it is. After the state is captured the program continues. For the method timing example earlier, a sampling profiler would interrupt the program after a certain amount of time had elapsed and capture its state. It would then aggregate those samples over time to produce a statistical picture of the state of the application. You could use the percent of samples that contained a method of interest to calculate how much time was spent in that method (though not the duration of that method).</p>
<p><img alt="Profiling samples being taken of the call stack" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/profiling_in_production_series/sampling_profiling.png" title="Profiling samples being taken of the call stack"></p>
<p>The above is an example of an idealised sampling profiler. The black boxes represent the call stack, a box above is called by a box below, and the green lines indicate the points at which the profiler interrupts and captures the call stack of the application. Our first sample would be in Server.handleRequest(), the second sample would show us being in the Customer constructor with a stack trace as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Customer()</span>
<span>Customer.lookup()</span>
<span>Order.getStatus()</span>
<span>Server.handleRequest()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In contrast to instrumentation, profiling by sampling has two main forms of overhead - the frequency with which we stop the application and the cost of stopping the application along with capturing its state. Both of these are independent of the actual structure of the application we’re testing, so we don’t have the same fundamental accuracy problem we had with instrumentation.</p>
<p>We also have some control over the frequency we stop the application, so we can choose the level of overhead that a sampling profiler has. Obviously if the cost of stopping the application is high then we need a very low sampling frequency to maintain a low overhead but with a reasonably cheap mechanism for stopping the application we can profile at high frequencies with very low overhead.</p>
<p>To summarise what you’ve covered in this post, there are predominantly two types of profilers: <em>instrumenting</em> and <em>sampling</em>. The former adds <em>instrumentation</em> to collect data but in doing so changes the behaviour of the application. _Sampling _doesn’t change the behaviour of the application but gives you a statistical aggregation of the data instead.</p>
<p>In the next post you’re going to see how there’s more than just one type of <em>time</em> when it comes to profiling and why looking at the right timing type can be a crucial part of solving a performance issue.</p>

5
min read (1250 words).</p></header><p>The technical design and building blocks of this blog.</p><img src="https://hampuswessman.se/2021/01/building-this-blog-using-hugo/cover.png" alt="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code with blog source
code open" width="710" height="558"><p>Since that is my primary interest, I will focus on the high-level technical
design similar to what one would find in a design document and mostly ignore the
code and implementation details. Read the documentation linked to for details.</p><h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3><p>I wanted a blog where I could write about mainly technical and mathematical
topics, both as a way of learning and as a way of sharing knowledge. As such,
the focus should be on the content and I clearly needed support for writing
mathematics and quoting source code. At the same time, I also wanted to be able
to extend the website to include for example pages about projects, link
collections, short e-books, or anything similar in the future. I also wanted a
clean Scandinavian design on the minimalist side.</p><p>My requirements looked something like this:</p><ul><li>Basic blog functionality.</li><li>Support for mathematical equations.</li><li>Support for syntax highlighted source code.</li><li>Extendability beyond a pure blog.</li><li>Control over the visual design and technology.</li><li>Adapted to both desktop and mobile viewing.</li><li>Low cost and high performance even at scale.</li><li>Version control of some kind and backup of content.</li><li>Basic visitor statistics.</li><li>Full GDPR compliance.</li><li>No need for comments on the website.</li><li>Easy to share on social media.</li><li>Simple technology if possible.</li></ul><p>Based on this, I set out to investigate my options.</p><h3 id="technical-design-choices">Technical design choices</h3><p>From the beginning, I had my eyes on trying out some kind of <strong>static site
generator</strong> (see also <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>). These kinds of tools
have become popular in recent years and for good reasons. The basic idea is that
you create your content in some way separate from the website itself and then
generate the entire website based on the latest content ahead of time. All you
need to publish online in the end are the generated static web pages and related
content.</p><p>The advantages of this are quite obvious:</p><ul><li>Good security: no custom server software that can be vulnerable.</li><li>Good performance: no need to generate anything on-demand!</li><li>Good caching: potentially possible to cache static content.</li><li>Low cost: for the same reasons. No database or server app.</li></ul><p>Naturally, I wanted to go down this path as it seems a perfect fit. The
potential drawback could be limited flexibility, because of the tool or the
concept itself. With this in mind, I looked into a few different options and
eventually determined that <strong><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></strong> fulfilled my
requirements and is nice to work with.</p><p>Hugo is available as packages for most Linux distributions, so it’s easy to
install. The next choice to decide on was whether to start with an existing
<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo theme</a>. Depending on one’s goals and taste,
this is likely a very good option. I had a look at existing themes and deciding
to continue without, since one of my requirements were to keep control over
these aspects. Therefore, I instead created <strong>my own layout templates</strong> from the
start.</p><p>At this point, I made a detour to look into hosting options. An Ex-Googler as I
am, I went for <strong><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting">Firebase hosting</a></strong>,
which is both very easy to use with these tools and works great through Google’s
worldwide CDN. Headers can be controlled to adjust caching for different kinds
of files. New versions can easily be deployed through the Firebase CLI.</p><p>Next, I looked into the options for mathematical equations. I already knew about
<a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, but also found out about the newer
<strong><a href="https://katex.org/">$\KaTeX$</a></strong> which I ended up choosing.</p><p>Even though Hugo has a built-in alternative, I also decided to set up
<strong><a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a></strong> together with NPM for bundling
JavaScript, CSS, and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> resources. This works well
for bundling my own such resources together with those from third-party NPM
packages. To tie everything together, I have a simple <strong>Makefile</strong>. Hugo and
webpack can also both run in watch-mode at the same time and will detect changes
in sequence.</p><p>I still have one main area left to explore: web design. Here, I decided to try
something new and use <strong><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></strong>, which fits
well into the webpack workflow. I only use some parts, but it has helped a lot
in combination with my own HTML, Sass, and JS too. For some extensions of my
own, I needed some small animations and decided to use
<strong><a href="https://animejs.com/">anime.js</a></strong>, which turned out to be very useful even
for relatively easy animations (related to the menu).</p><p>To get basic visitor statistics, I use <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics">Google
Analytics</a></strong> with
<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs">analytics.js</a>
and all tracking through cookies and similar disabled.</p><p>As usual, I’m also using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio
Code</a>, and <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>
for development. At this time, the source code repo is private.</p><p>In summary, I decided to use this tech stack:</p><ul><li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting">Firebase hosting</a>.</li><li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as static site generator.<ul><li>Using my own layouts.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> for bundling resources.</li><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/">Makefile</a> for automating common
tasks.</li><li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://katex.org/">Katex</a>, and
<a href="https://animejs.com/">anime.js</a> for the web frontend.</li></ul><h3 id="hugo">Hugo</h3><p>One of the best things about Hugo is that you can add your own
<a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/">shortcodes</a>. This makes it
easy to generate some custom HTML easily from within your content files in a
reusable way.</p><p>As an example, I have this shortcode template called danger.html:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"alert alert-danger"</span> <span>role</span><span>=</span><span>"alert"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    {{- .Inner | .Page.RenderString -}}
<span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>Similarly, I’ve created a partial for the layout templates that shows the
estimated reading time. It’s based on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/13/most-comprehensive-review-to-date-suggests-the-average-persons-reading-speed-is-slower-than-commonly-thought/">this
article</a>
which suggests that the average reading speed is 238 words per minute. The partial then becomes:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html">{{ math.Round (div (countwords .Content) 238.0) | default 1 }}</code></pre></div><p>There’s a lot more to say about Hugo, but I will simply suggest reading the
official documentation and being creative. It can’t do everything, but it can do
a lot and can always be extended if needed since it’s open source.</p><h3 id="webpack">Webpack</h3><p>Webpack is a great JavaScript tool. The only downside is that it’s so flexible
that it’s hard to configure it at times. Reading the documentation is useful, of
course, but examples are good too. Here’s my Webpack config, without Katex:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>You may need to install some of these NPM packages too:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">  <span>"devDependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"autoprefixer"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^10.1.0"</span><span>,</span>

    <span>"webpack-cli"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^4.2.0"</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Some of the above packages are only used for bundling up Katex (file-loader and
css-loader), which is fairly easy to set up too.</p><h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3><p>I’ve found that the following JavaScript disables all important tracking for a
more privacy-focused use of Google Analytics:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>ga</span><span>(</span><span>'create'</span><span>,</span> <span>'UA-XYZ'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>cookieDomain</span><span>:</span> <span>'none'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>storage</span><span>:</span> <span>'none'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>storeGac</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>
<span>ga</span><span>(</span><span>'set'</span><span>,</span> <span>'allowAdFeatures'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>ga</span><span>(</span><span>'set'</span><span>,</span> <span>'anonymizeIp'</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>);</span>
<span>ga</span><span>(</span><span>'send'</span><span>,</span> <span>'pageview'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I’ve only found a way to do this using
<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs">analytics.js</a>.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>I’m very happy with the website / blog so far and it feels like I made the right
choices for me. The technology is simple and still sufficient to not be
limiting. I can also work with all my favourite development tools. I can
definitely recommend a similar setup, tuned to your own preferences!</p><h3 id="see-also">See also</h3><p>Related content:</p><ul><li><a href="https://hampuswessman.se/2021/01/gdpr-for-personal-websites/">GDPR for personal websites</a></li></ul><nav><a href="https://hampuswessman.se/2021/01/gdpr-for-personal-websites/">Previous: GDPR for personal websites</a></nav></div></div>]]>

<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post, which I'll update periodically, explains the project's motivation
from several perspectives.  Because Unix shell is an old and successful
technology, there are many ways of looking at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<a name="toc_0"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Before explaining <strong>why</strong> I created Oil, let's review <strong>what</strong> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/02/24/bash.html">ships on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">now runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a new shell implementation that's part of the Oil
project.  It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run
<strong>existing shell scripts</strong>.  As of January 2018, I've made <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">major
progress</a> toward this goal.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've designed it, but not yet implemented it.  However, the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil">OSH-to-Oil
translator</a> works.</li>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, it should be <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It has more consistent syntax and semantics.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
better structured data types.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get <a href="#oil-glimpse">a glimpse of Oil</a> at the end of this document.  I
link to several blog posts; the ones that describe the Oil language most
clearly are the two on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil">Translating Shell to Oil</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, as I wrote in <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/10/06.html">Roadmap #5</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is your upgrade path from <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>. It's the only language that shell /
bash can be automatically translated to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Update 10/2019: Oil is no longer focused on auto-translation, but it's still
your upgrade path from bash.  See <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2019/10/04.html">You Can Now Try the Oil
Language</a> for up-to-date information.</em></p>

<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<a name="toc_2"></a>
<h4>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h4>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

</ul>
<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<a name="toc_3"></a>
<h4>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h4>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small
amount of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a brand new cluster manager from Google (released around
2014), has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<a name="toc_4"></a>
<h4>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h4>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<a name="toc_5"></a>
<h4>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h4>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<a name="toc_6"></a>
<h4>Are you reinventing Perl?</h4>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>

</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<a name="toc_7"></a>
<h4>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h4>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16156689">My Response</a> (Hacker News)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="limit-to-posix"></a>
<a name="toc_8"></a>
<h4 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h4>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is <strong>incomplete</strong> and <strong>out of date</strong>.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2018, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
<strong>same philosophy</strong> as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>

<p>(a massive, 100-part essay)</p>

<p>I recently finished this excellent short book titled <em>What Has Government Done To Our Money</em>. <a href="https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money">It’s available on the Internet for free</a> and I highly recommend reading it. But in case you want the key insights, here are my notes.</p>

<h3>Money as a medium of exchange</h3>

<p>1/ In an economy, there’s a variety of people. Different folks specialize in producing different things and each one of them desires different things.</p>

<p>2/ If there are only two people, they can barter (i.e. <em>directly exchange</em>) what each one of them has with what the other one needs. Even with two people, an exchange rate emerges (e.g. how many loaves of bread you both agree on for a pair of shoes?)</p>

<p>3/ But with more people involved, barter collapses because of two reasons: indivisibility and lack of coincidence of <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/jobs-to-be-done/">wants</a>.</p>

<p>4/ Indivisibility means that if you’re a shoe-maker, you can’t barter half a shoe for a loaf of bread (if that’s all that you need and you don’t want to overpay).</p>

<p>5/ Lack of coincidence of wants means that you may want a loaf of bread but the other person doesn’t need shoes, he needs a shirt and you don’t know how to make one. </p>

<p>6/ Of course, this can be solved via an indirect exchange. You can find a shirtmaker who wants shoes and use your newly acquired shirt for a loaf of bread. Problem solved?</p>

<p>7/ Yes, for now. But as you can imagine, this doesn’t scale well. As the number of people who want to trade expands, the lack of coincidence of wants becomes a bottleneck for general prosperity. Transaction costs of finding someone who wants what you have becomes too high.</p>

<p>8/ To solve this problem, people gradually start accepting a commodity that is divisible into smaller units and which they believe are widely demanded. Take butter for example. You accept it in exchange for the shoes you’ve made because you know you can find someone who wants butter easily and can pay him with a fraction of the butter weight you think is worth what that person is selling.</p>

<p>9/ Butter gradually becomes a widely used medium of exchange. But butter is not the only possible medium of exchange. Salt, tobacco, wheat and many other commodities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money">have been used as mediums of exchange.</a></p>

<p>10/ When multiple possible commodities are being used as a medium of exchange, only a few emerge as winners. Which one wins depends on two factors: a) marketability of the currency; b) <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/network-effects-economic-moats/">network effects</a>.</p>

<p>11/ Marketability is simply how good a commodity is in functioning as money. You need money to be easy to store, transportable, divisible, and durable. Some commodities fare better on these criteria than others.</p>

<p>12/ Network effects mean that the more widely a currency is accepted by others, the more likely is it to get accepted by others. (<a href="https://invertedpassion.com/bitcoin-is-mother-of-all-network-effects/">This is also why bitcoin is the mother of all network effects</a>).</p>

<p>13/ Gradually, because of better marketability and network effects, during the course of history, metals like gold and silver emerged as preferred mediums of exchange. </p>

<p>14/ A commodity like gold gets established as money when all other commodities have a relatively stable exchange rate with it. </p>

<p>15/ Nobody decides how many grams of gold is a cow worth. The market gradually determines this exchange rate by accounting for supply and demand for both commodities: gold and cows.</p>

<p>16/ The key to understanding money is to remember that it is a commodity whose utility is in facilitating exchanges, just like leather is a commodity whose utility is in making shoe soles.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You will get a lot of clarity once you STOP thinking about money in units of rupees or dollars, and START measuring it in units of “purchasing power”.</p>

<p>17/ To drive home this point, consider money as a commodity (like milk) that you can buy. What do you pay to “buy” money? Your goods and services. What do you get in return when you “sell” money? Other people’s goods and services.</p>

<h2>Benefits of money</h2>

<p>18/ The biggest benefit of money is in expanding the trade between people, and hence rewarding specialization. Increasing specialization creates prosperity as now you don’t just have shoes, you have sports shoes, party shoes, formal shoes, and so on. So, multiple types of shoes can exist because consumer <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/why-do-businesses-exist/">desire</a> for everything can now be measured in money.</p>

<p>19/ This money-driven price discovery helps foster innovation because entrepreneurs can race to produce goods and services that fetch more money, thereby creating things that wouldn’t exist otherwise.</p>

<p>20/ A stable price of goods also helps businessmen plan ahead in the future. They can allocate their resources effectively because they know a profit will emerge from the investment.</p>

<h2>Money as purchasing power</h2>

<p>21/ Just like goods and services can be measured in money (how many ounces of gold is this house), money can be measured in terms of what kinds of and how many goods and services can money get you (what can I afford if I have an ounce of gold?).</p>

<p>22/ It’s useful to imagine money as a commodity just like any other commodity (glass, TVs, English language classes, Facebook stock and so on). In an ideal world where price discovery is perfect, all commodities have an exchange rate with each other (how many hours of English language classes for a TV). </p>

<p>23/ Money is simply a commodity with the widest price discovery against all other commodities and <em>because</em> of that everyone accepts it. That is what gives money its purchasing power.</p>

<h2>The business of making money</h2>

<p>24/ What if a fairy comes and doubles the money that everyone has? Does everyone suddenly become twice as rich?</p>

<p>25/ No. Because money is a medium of exchange, it doesn’t get consumed in the process. If at all, money has very limited consumption uses (gold used in industrial uses or in dentistry). Except for those limited cases, double the amount of gold currency would simply double the prices of everything else.</p>

<p>26/ To understand this, imagine another commodity like milk. If via any method, we have twice the amount of milk in the world, its price will drop in half. </p>

<p>27/ Similar dynamics happen with money. Only by increasing the amount of money, no prosperity happens. Prosperity happens via innovation – when there are more (in number and type) goods and services available for people to enjoy.</p>

<p>28/ What about gold miners? Are they richer than others? Not really. Like any other business, mining of gold involves a cost. There’s a cost of discovery and acquisition of land rights for gold, people cost, machinery cost, and so on. </p>

<p>29/ Markets drive returns for any type of business to average returns (returns enjoyed by any other business). So, in the long run, gold mining doesn’t make the owners richer than say making butter. (Don’t believe me? Bitcoin mining offers real-world proof. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/asic-financing-driving-hashrate-bitcoin-mining-profitability">It’s no longer profitable to mine bitcoins</a>). </p>

<h2>The takeover of money</h2>

<p>30/ Kings and rulers of the past depended on <em>direct confiscation</em> of commodities as a way to sustain their armies and lifestyle. This is how taxation came along.</p>

<p>31/ Citizens have an incentive to evade taxation, and it’s also an operational nightmare. An easy and convenient alternative to taxation is controlling the money supply in the state. You can call it <em>indirect confiscation</em>.</p>

<p>32/ It starts by labeling a certain weight or volume of currency with a specific name. So, instead of saying something is worth an ounce of silver, you say something is worth a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_dollar">dollar</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling">a pound sterling is a name for a specific weight of silver</a>.</p>

<p>33/ Under the hood, a dollar was (supposed to be) nothing but a silver coin that weighs an ounce. But labeling it with a dollar abstracts that reality a little bit and sets the stage for people in power (the government or the king) to steal money from the general populace via coin debasement.</p>

<p>34/ Here’s how the coin debasement works: you stamp coins with your brand, you outlaw all other coins, you require taxes to be paid in stamped coins and when you get coins, you literally melt them and make more coins, each with less weight than before. You keep some of the newly invented coins for yourself and release the remaining.</p>

<p>35/ Such coin debasement is a subtle way of stealing (or redistribution, depending on how you look at things). In other words, debasement leads to inflation. You have more coins in circulation for a similar amount of “stuff” in the world so the prices of “stuff” rise.</p>

<p>36/ With debasement, over time, people notice that coins are getting lighter, but this is where naming a coin helps. Through the legal tender, you declare all coins to be at par with each other. So by force of law, you require people to treat a dollar that’s an ounce of silver similarly to a dollar that’s worth less than that.</p>

<p>37/ The result of this is what’s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s law</a>: bad money drives good money out of circulation. As debasing of coins starts, people hoard coins that are debased and pretty soon only debased coins remain in circulation (which get debased even more by the kings). Over a period of time, this leads to coins being so light that they’re unusable.</p>

<p>38/ What also happens is that the non-debased, good quality coins get exported out of the state to other regions because they’re worth a lot more somewhere else. This leads to a flight of silver and gold out of the state, something that kings don’t desire.</p>

<p>39/ So the physics-based limits on how light coins can get keeps infinite debasement in check. And because debasement is in check, new money can’t be created indefinitely, so inflation is in check. But that game is about to get changed when governments and kings discover paper money.</p>

<h2>Banks as money warehouses</h2>

<p>40/ When you have a lot of coins, you’d want to store them at someplace that can protect them. That place can be called a warehouse for money, which is what a bank really is.</p>

<p>41/ Just like any other business, a bank …</p></div></article></div>

<h2>A guide to web Lottie animations: 5 steps to implement Lottie animations on your website.</h2>
<hr>
<div>
<h2>5 Steps to implement web animations</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why you should use Lottie animation on your website. We summarised some of them in our <a href="https://drawer.design/blog/why-we-prefer-lottie-over-other-animation/">previous blog post</a>, where you can further understand why we love Lottie so much. One of the benefits is its simplicity of use. If you are afraid to use Lottie animations on your website because of its implementation, don’t worry; we got your back with this simple guideline.</p>

<p><strong>1. Step – Animation file</strong><br>
To implement Lottie animation, first, you need to have the animation itself. All you need is Lottie animation, which comes as a JSON file. Your designer can create animation, or you can simply purchase it or download it for free. If you don’t have any JSON Lottie file, go ahead and check out our <a href="https://drawer.design/#products">Lottie animation Market</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://lottiefiles.com/">LottieFiles</a> , sure you find some that fit your style.</p>

<p><strong>2. Step – Test your animation</strong><br>
Before you start implementing your web animation, check if it works properly. Since opening a JSON file doesn’t tell you much, we have created a <a href="https://drawer.design/preview-lottie-animation/">Preview Lottie tool</a> where you can drag and drop your Lottie animations and quickly see if it’s working correctly. You can also change the background color to simulate the placement of your design better.</p>

<p><strong>3. Step – Implement Scripts</strong><br>
When you have a working Lottie file, you are ready to display it on your web with implementing scripts needed for JSON to be converted to SVG animation. It’s simple as adding any other script library to your HTML page. Here are two options you can go with.</p>

<p>1. <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web"><strong><em>Lottie.js</em></strong></a><br>
<code><span>&lt;script</span> <span>src</span>="<strong>https://cdnjs.com/libraries/lottie-web</strong>" <span>type</span>="<span>text/javascript</span>"<span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></code></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/airnan/project/editor/ZeNONO/" rel="nofollow">See a basic implementation here.</a> or <a href="http://codepen.io/collection/nVYWZR/" rel="nofollow">See examples on codepen.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XMUJdjI0L8" rel="nofollow">Here’s</a> a video tutorial explaining how to export a basic animation and load it on an HTML page</p>
<pre><span>&nbsp;</span></pre>
<p>2. <a href="https://github.com/LottieFiles/lottie-player"><em><strong>LottieFiles web player</strong></em></a></p>
<p><code><span>&lt;script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><strong><span id="package_url"><span>https://unpkg.com/@lottiefiles/lottie-player@latest/dist/lottie-player.js</span></span></strong><span>"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></p>
<p><a href="https://lottiefiles.com/web-player" rel="nofollow">See a basic implementation here.</a> or <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/y2nxyvomyj">See examples on codesandbox.</a></p>

<p><strong>4. Step – Load animation in HTML DOM</strong><br>
Scripts are ready, and so your JSON file; let initialize it in HTML code. By adding the path to the JSON animation file.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web"><strong><em>Lottie.js</em></strong></a></p>
<p><code><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>style</span>="<span>width:1067px;height:600px</span>" <span>class</span>="<span>lottie</span>" <span>data-animation-path</span>="<span><strong>animation/<span id="copy_url"><span>your-animation.json</span></span></strong></span>" <span>data-anim-loop</span>="<span>true</span>" <span>data-name</span>="<span>ninja</span>"<span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>2. <a href="https://github.com/LottieFiles/lottie-player"><em><strong>LottieFiles web player</strong></em></a></p>
<p><code><span>&lt;</span><span id="copy_player_t1"><span>lottie-player</span></span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"<span><strong>animation/</strong></span></span><strong><span id="copy_url"><span>your-animation.json</span></span></strong><span>"</span>  <span>background</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>transparent</span><span>"</span>  <span>speed</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>1</span><span>"</span>  <span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>300px</span><span>;</span> <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>300px</span><span>;</span><span>"</span>  <span>loop</span> <span>controls</span> <span>autoplay</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span id="copy_player_t2"><span>lottie-player</span></span><span>&gt;</span></code><code></code></p>
<p>And that’s it; you should see the animation on your page. Simple right? If you are not satisfied with the animations’ behavior, there are still a few things you can adjust.</p>

<p><strong>5. Step – Animation adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Adjustments are possible with both solutions and quite limited but enough for you to tweak it just right.</p>
<p>What can be adjusted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Loop</li>
<li>Autoplay</li>
<li>Background-color</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BONUS – Tips for performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We recommend using the CDN link because it has a fast connection response so that your script doesn’t affect the speed load too much.</span></li>
<li>Adding script ideally to the FOOTER section to prevent loading too early.</li>
<li>Preconnect library server on HEAD for faster script loading.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>&lt;link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/" crossorigin&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>First prefetch JSON animation file in HEAD for faster loading.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>&lt;link rel="preload" as="fetch" crossorigin="anonymous" type="application/json" href="/animation/your-animation.json"&gt;</code></p>

<p><strong>Enjoy your animation!</strong></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the beginning of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/">Terminator 2: Judgement Day</a>, John Connor uses a laptop to crack the PIN of a stolen debit card.</p>



<p>I don’t think I saw Terminator 2 in the theater. I probably watched it years later on LaserDisc but the scene left quite an impression on me. I had a similar reaction to the war dialer in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/">WarGames</a> and the black box in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/">Sneakers</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was thinking about that scene from Terminator 2 recently which led me to googling, “What’s that laptop in Terminator 2?”</p>

<p>It’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Portfolio">Atari Portfolio</a>, the world’s first palmtop computer. It was released in June 1989.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/portfolio.png" alt="Atari Portfolio"></p>

<p>It had a monochrome LCD with 240x64 pixels or 40 characters x 8 lines and ran off 3 AA batteries.</p>

<p>The next thing I wondered was, “How difficult would it be to write that program?” Not a program that actually cracks PIN numbers from debit cards, I don’t think you can actually do that with a serial cable and some aluminum foil wrapped around a debit card, but a program that can simulate the output of the palmtop in that scene.</p>

<p>Let’s gather some product requirements!</p>

<p>If we watch the video again, the first thing that happens is that it displays a banner for the program.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/pinip.jpg" alt="banner"></p>

<p>The image is clear enough that you can copy the banner easily.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N
P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION
P   PP     I      N N  N
PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM
P          I      N   NN
P       IIIIIII   N    N

Strike a key when ready ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, John hits Enter and the numbers start scrolling. If we look a few frames in:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/firstline.jpg" alt="first line"></p>

<p>We can see that the first line of numbers is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>12345678901234567890123457890123456780
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One might assume that this is just the digits 1 through 0 repeated four times, but upon closer look, it’s only 38 digits long. In the third set, the number 6 is omitted, and the last set, the number 9 is omitted.</p>

<p>The way the numbers decrease isn’t obvious either, but it seems like it prints about 5 lines at a certain length before decreasing the length by 1, but after the next set it decreases the length by 2 and then alternates back and forth until it identifies the 4-digit PIN code and dumps him back to a prompt.</p>

<p>Well, that seems pretty straightforward. I’ve been trying to get better at Python so here’s a script I wrote in Python 3:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3

<p>The script runs really quickly so I added a delay between lines so that you can see the same progression as in the clip. I’m sure there are other optimizations that can be made, but if I were administering this as a bad coding challenge for a tech interview, I’d pass myself.</p>

<p>Using Google Image Search, I found a site selling OEM plastic bezels for the Atari Portfolio which had this nice graphic of the front of the screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/bezel.jpg" alt="screen bezel"></p>

<p>After playing around with <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg">termtosvg</a> a bit, in particular the <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg/blob/develop/man/termtosvg-templates.md">SVG templates</a> feature, I managed to produce this crazy SVG:</p>

<p>Despite running <a href="https://html5zombo.com/">html5zombo.com</a> for over 10 years now, I’m not sure I really appreciated what SVGs were capable of until I built this one. They can embed images? CSS? Javascript? Any site that allows users to upload arbitrary SVGs and <a href="https://github.com/bertrandom/pinid">renders them</a> now has my utmost respect.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed making my little self-contained SVG, it bugged me that my Python code could never actually run on an Atari Portfolio. The Atari Portfolio runs “DIP Operating System 2.11” (DIP DOS) which is “mostly compatible” with MS-DOS.</p>

<p>In junior high, before anybody paid me to write software professionally, I used to write BBS software, mods, and door games in my spare time in a mix of Turbo Pascal and a scripting language called PCBoard Programming Language which was similar to BASIC. Based on my minimal research, if I could write this in Turbo Pascal and compile it, it’d probably run on an Atari Portfolio.</p>

<p>I haven’t written Turbo Pascal in about 25 years, but do you ever really forget?</p>

<p>I like a fork of DOSBox called <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a>, so I downloaded and installed the most recent SDL2 variant for OS X. Then I found a copy of Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0, which I’ll put <a href="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/tp7.zip">here</a> because it was kind of a pain to find.</p>

<p>You’ll find 4 files in that ZIP which are images of floppy disks. If you put them in a directory like <code>~/tp</code>, after you start DOSBox-X and mount a C Drive, you can mount them to the A Drive like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>imgmount a ~/tp/Disk01.img ~/tp/Disk02.img ~/tp/Disk03.img ~/tp/Disk04.img -floppy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then switch over to the A: drive and run INSTALL:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_000.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_001.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_002.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_003.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>At some point in the installation, you’ll have to change floppy disks, because it’s 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_004.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>You can do this by selecting <strong>Drive</strong> -&gt; <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>Swap disk</strong> in DOSBox-X. It’ll go from Disk 1 to Disk 2. Then just keep doing that and pressing enter until you’ve installed all four disks.</p>

<p>After the installation is done, it’ll ask you to configure your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> because again, 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_005.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>Neither of these are strictly necessary. DOSBox-X already sets the FILES higher than the recommendation and adding it to the path only really lets you run TURBO from anywhere. When it’s done, you can run:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_000.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_001.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p>I’d spent so much time looking at this IDE when I was a kid that it made me a bit nostalgic. But then I started porting my Python script to Pascal and that nostalgia faded quickly. I’d like to say that I wrote the whole thing in here but at a certain point I had to switch to VSCode and then copy the file back into the DOS directory. To the people that still run <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/">WordPerfect for DOS</a>, I get it, but I also don’t get it.</p>

<p>Here’s the script I landed on after spending a lot of time on this <a href="https://wiki.freepascal.org/Basic_Pascal_Tutorial">Pascal tutorial</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>program pinid;
uses crt;

var i: byte;
var pos: byte;
var lines: byte;
var length: byte;
var decrease: byte;
var delay_amount: integer;

begin
     randomize;

     delay_amount := 25;

     clrscr;

     writeln('PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      N N  N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P          I      N   NN');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P       IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('');

     write('Strike a key when ready ...');
     readln;

     writeln('');
     writeln('');
     writeln('12345678901234567890123457890123456780');

     pos := 0;
     lines := 1;

     length := 38;
     decrease := 1;

     while true do
     begin
          for i:= 1 to length do 
               write(random(9));
          writeln('');
          delay(delay_amount);
          lines := lines + 1;
          if (lines = 5) then
          begin
               lines := 0;
               length := length - decrease;
               if (decrease = 1) then
                   decrease := 2
               else
                   decrease := 1;
          end;
          if (length &lt;= 4) then
               break;
     end;

     for i:= 1 to 10 do
     begin
          writeln('9003');
          delay(delay_amount);
     end;

     writeln('');
     writeln('PIN IDENTIFICATION NUMBER: 9003');
     writeln('');

end.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some quick explanations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pascal has type declarations. A byte can be a number from 0-255.</li>
  <li>files start with <code>program</code> and the name of the program, presumably because all modules share the same namespace but the filename is irrelevant</li>
  <li>modules are imported with the word <code>uses</code>. <code>crt</code> is a module for manipulating the screen</li>
  <li>:= is the syntax for variable assignment, so you can compare with = and differentiate between the two.</li>
  <li>If blocks are longer than one line, you have to wrap them with <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> instead of brackets or relying upon whitespace.</li>
  <li>If you don’t run <code>randomize</code> at the beginning of your script, hilariously it always seeds random numbers with the same seed and the output is the same.</li>
  <li>WRITE writes a string, WRITELN writes a string with a newline. READLN accepts input until a newline is received.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it work? Here’s the program running in DOSBox-X:</p>



<p>In the spirit of owning less stuff, I’ve gone through the mental exercise of what it would take to make the rest of this a reality but will not follow through on any of it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy an Atari Portfolio on Ebay.</li>
  <li>Buy an <a href="http://www.best-electronics-ca.com/portfoli.htm">Atari Portfolio parallel interface and probably a new screen bezel</a> because it’s likely scratched.</li>
  <li>Find a parallel cable in my box of cables.</li>
  <li>Find a PC or laptop with a parallel port, install MS-DOS v6.22 on it.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/mirror/www.umich.edu/%257Earchive/atari/Portfolio/Telecomm/index.html">FT.COM</a> and put it on the PC.</li>
  <li>Build the EXE in Dosbox-X and transfer it to the Atari Portfolio.</li>
  <li>Steal a debit card.</li>
  <li>Wrap part of the card in aluminum foil, buy an Atari Portfolio serial interface, run a cable to the card.</li>
  <li>Run the program.</li>
  <li>Easy money!</li>
</ol>

<div>
    <main>
        

        <div>
            <article>
                
<ul>
<li>I made a tiny software product, called <a href="https://walkfromhome.lol/app/index.html">Walk from Home</a>.</li>
<li>It is a web application that has exactly one feature and is made up of about 2000 lines of code.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, the implementation uses 24 different technology concepts, each of which have entire books dedicated to them.</li>
<li>Seemingly trivial product decisions can easily double or halve that number, which is why product engineering is hard.</li>
<li>A software product is not the same thing as a computer program. Confusing these may lead some to believe that small products are easy.</li>
<li>Software products (not computer programs) are hard because, amongst other things, users expect more than ever before, non functional concerns are of previously unimaginable proportions (e.g. security), and distribution needs to take into account devices that you didn't know existed.</li>
<li>They will become harder, because machine learning will be the norm, and proprietary data sets are the new unfair competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a tiny software product called <a href="https://walkfromhome.lol/app/index.html">Walk from Home (WfH)</a>. It has one feature: given a list of participants and their postal codes, generate pairs of participants that minimise the total distance participants have to travel in order to meet their pairing partner. The list of participants is provided by uploading a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and the resulting pairings are obtained by downloading a different Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I did not create WfH because I think it will be hugely successful. In fact, I would be surprised if anyone uses it. The need was not researched, I did not talk to any prospective users, and I have no clue if there is a market for the solution. The odds of launching a product without research and it being a hit are against me… I just created WfH to see what it is like to single handedly build a usable software product in 2021.</p>

---------------------------------
</pre>

<p>To appreciate how tiny WfH as a product is, the above table shows that a grand total of about 2000 lines were written.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>To write and deploy those 2000 lines, you need working knowledge of 3 languages, 2 development frameworks, 8 development tools, 4 cloud services, and 3 notable third party libraries.</p>
<p>The list of required working knowledge or necessitated research:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript, JSX, HTML, CSS</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Bash scripting</li>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>FastAPI</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Webpack</li>
<li>npm</li>
<li>pip</li>
<li>pipenv</li>
<li>Google Cloud Run</li>
<li>Google Cloud Container Registry</li>
<li>Google Cloud DNS</li>
<li>Notable JS libraries: LeafletJS</li>
<li>Notable Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, xlsxwriter</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, WfH contains a couple of neat challenges under the hood: combinatorial optimisation, and geocoding.</p>
<h2>Matching Pairs</h2>
<p>The number of pairs you can create from <em>n</em> participants is <em>n(n - 1)</em>. For 200 participants, there are roughly 40 thousand options. WfH attempts to find the pairings that minimise the total distance participants have to travel. The search space is quite manageable: it grows quadratic with the number of participants. Yet, the evaluation of a single candidate solution is computationally expensive, as each unique pairing requires a distance calculation between two geocoded postal codes. With a heavily optimised implementation, brute force could be an option. But in the end a greedy hill climbing approach was used, allowing for a non-optimised pure Python implementation, which is easier to write.</p>
<p>WfH uses the distance along a straight line between geocoded postal codes, but a more useful implementation would use travel time as a distance measure. But simply switching the calculation from straight line distance to travel time distance would have easily doubled, if not tripled the development effort.</p>
<p>The straight line distance calculation is simplified by geocoding the postal codes to the <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksdriehoeksco%C3%B6rdinaten">Dutch RD coordinate system</a>, which is approximately Euclidean within its valid area. With RD coordinates, centroid calculations are a single NumPy operation (<code>np.mean(...)</code>). They also avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a> during evaluation.</p>
<p>Adding to the list of required working knowledge or necessitated research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approaches to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization">combinatorial optimization</a> problems</li>
<li>Basic understanding of geo coordinate systems / map projections</li>
<li>Dutch RD coordinate system</li>
<li>Distance calculations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Geocoding</h2>
<p>The few vendors (including Google) who provide geocoding of entities (postal codes, addresses, points of interest) as a service charge handsomely for their work. A free product like WfH would not be viable when relying on a geocoding API. Luckily, WfH only requires a minimal subset of all geocoding features: convert a Dutch postal code into a single coordinate that is roughly at the center of the area. Instead of full geocoding, it needs a geocoded Dutch postal code table. But simply switching the location precision from postal codes to full addresses as location input would have made the entire product financially infeasible.</p>
<p>How do you obtain a geocoded Dutch postal code table? It turns out you can buy one; the price tag is several hundred Euro. Not prohibitively expensive, but just out of range for a hobby project. Besides, Dutch addresses, postal codes, and building geometries are open data. Navigating open data portals provided by the Dutch government is an art form in and of itself, but after some digging you should be able to find a downloadable version of the complete <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basisregistratie_Adressen_en_Gebouwen">BAG</a>, the registration data for addresses and buildings. From there on, it is only a matter of parsing tens of gigabytes of XML, extracting the postal codes from all addresses, joining with building geometries (a separate set of XML files), and determining the centroid for each unique postal code. The solution for WfH involves a combination of Python and Bash scripts. The essential trick is to make sure that the XML parser is a streaming (event based) parser, so you can pass over the gigabytes of XML once without running out of memory. At this point, I could have gone into the business of selling postal code tables, but I chose to finish WfH instead.</p>
<p>Adding to the list of required working knowledge or necessitated research:</p>
<ul>
<li>The BAG dataset and its entities</li>
<li>Geography Markup Language (GML)</li>
<li>Streaming XML parsing</li>
<li>Effective use of the <code>cut</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>uniq</code>, and <code>join</code> cli tools</li>
</ul>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>WfH is a web application. It could also have been a single Python script in a Github repo somewhere and provide exactly the same functionality. It could also have been a mobile app that all participants would need to install to create a schedule. Choice of distribution matters a lot when it comes to adoption. The distribution for WfH has one user do a lot of work to make it easier for all other participants. A web application also holds a nice middle ground in terms of complexity. No app stores, approval processes, etc., but definitely not as trivial as leaving script on Github.</p>
<p>Additionally, I set a number of hard constraints for WfH: no user accounts, no email, and no server side state. These help stay within the budget for a free solution (zero), avoid compliance risk with data privacy or other legislation, and maintain simplicity. Such constraints also help guide the decision on which distribution to use. Simply switching from web application to mobile would have easily quadrupled development effort. Just leaving a script on Github does not make a software product; it just makes a computer program, which is not the same thing.</p>

<p>Tallying the total of tools, techniques, programming languages, concepts, frameworks, and libraries listed above, we find that WfH depends on a grand total of 24. Each of these have entire books dedicated to them. Any seemingly minimal change in the product specification could have doubled or halved that list. That is why product engineering is hard: a minimal change in specification can mean the difference between <em>fairly doable</em> or <em>completely infeasible</em>. Number of features does not matter. For WfH with only one feature, we have highlighted two design decisions that made the difference between feasibility or failure.</p>
<p>Whenever someone asks me <em>"How much does a good mobile app cost?"</em>, my default answer is <em>"one million per year (EUR)"</em>. My response is typically met with astonishment. Or contempt, thinking I am not taking the question seriously. But let's see what you can buy for about a million a year.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 computer programmers: EUR 195000,- / year</li>
<li>1 UI / UX designer: EUR 78000,- / year</li>
<li>1 senior product manager: 104000,- / year</li>
<li>Cloud hosting and tooling: EUR 15000,- / year</li>
<li>Need machine learning? Add 1 ML engineer: 117000,- / year</li>
<li>Want a game? Add 1 game developer: 97500,- / year</li>
<li>Need integrations? Add 1 additional computer programmer: 97500,- / year</li>
</ul>
<p>It adds up to roughly half a million per year, give or take, so one million is clearly exaggerating. Unless you want anyone to use your app; then that is where the other half of the million goes: promotion, and driving engagement.</p>
<p>Things were not always this way. There was a time when software and computer programs were the same thing. One boss person would manage the programmers, and the programmers would deliver the software. Distribution was shipping a floppy disk. What has happened since? Well, here are a couple of things that happened:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Users expect more. Way more.</em> For example, search used to be a database query with wildcards. Now you are expected to do auto completion, spelling correction, synonym matching, some minimal learn to rank implementation, and deliver all of it with sub 100ms 99p latencies.</li>
<li><em>Security is a really big deal.</em> If the wrong group of people is bored for an afternoon, and your property is not fronted with …</li></ul></article></div></main></div></div></div>

<h2><span id="Looking_Back_at_Mobile_App_Usage_Statistics_2020"></span><b>Looking Back at </b><b>Mobile App Usage Statistics 2020</b><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Mobile applications are revolutionizing industries and businesses. They are not mere leisure, they are offering accessibility and convenience to a global audience. </span>Mobile app market size in 2020<span> was valued at approx <strong>USD 170.52</strong> <strong>billion.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Today there are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/">2.56 million apps </a>available for users to download through Google Play Store, followed by 1.85 million downloadable apps available on the App store. They are ranging from payments to ride-sharing applications, each has its own merits.</span></p>
<p><span>If we are to talk about </span>free apps vs paid apps, statistics <span>tell us that 98% of app revenue worldwide comes from free apps and with fewer people willing to pay for downloads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, mobile apps account for <strong>57% of all digital media usage</strong> and an average mobile phone user has at least 40 apps installed on their phones. These numbers are quite impressive. Keeping in view these statistics, the future of mobile app development seems demanding to surpass customer expectations.</span></p>
<p><span>So to succeed, it’s important to prioritize the ongoing </span><b>mobile app trends</b><span>. Below is a list of 8 </span>mobile app development trends<span> that will surely redefine the smart industry in 2021.</span></p>

<h2><span id="7_Mobile_App_Development_trends_to_expect_in_2021"></span><b>7 </b><b>Mobile App Development trends to expect in 2021</b><span></span></h2>

<h3><span id="Mobile_(m)_Commerce"></span>Mobile (m) Commerce<span></span></h3>
<p><span>mCommerce is one of the most prominent </span>mobile app development trends <span>that we will see more of, as we enter 2021. According to Statista, mCommerce market value is expected to grow to<strong> 740B by 2023</strong>. The pandemic accelerated the growth of eCommerce through mobile, it was one of the dominating trends of 2020 and is anticipated to rule in the upcoming years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As more and more people use their mobile devices for making a purchase, mobile development directed towards mCommerce is expected to grow at an unprecedented rate; making older buying behaviors obsolete.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Failing to do so, can result in a significant impact on business conversion rates. A seamless user interface, effortless checkout, integrating mobile wallets, and user-friendly navigation are a few of the many factors to keep in mind, moving forward. These growing trends will allow developers to build even more intuitive mCommerce applications.</span></p>
<h3><span id="Augmented_Reality"></span><b><br>
</b>Augmented Reality<span></span></h3>
<p><span>AR, being just a theory, coined back in 1990 is still going strong! Augmented reality is greatly impacting the app development industry with the launch of <em>Pokemon Go</em> back in 2016. It is one of the most immersive mobile app development trends of 2021 and is already shaping app development worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AR allows developers to enhance real physical surroundings by overlaying them with digital visual elements. This technology is becoming extremely popular among users because of its appealing features. AR is providing immersive experiences in gaming especially, and evidently, it is bringing in more potential for</span><b> mobile app development</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AR will surely revolutionize the hospitality, gaming, healthcare, and other major industries of the world.</span></p>

<h3><span id="Foldable_Devices"></span>Foldable Devices<span></span></h3>
<p><span>Foldable touch screens are a disruptive innovation in smartphones. Since foldable devices are under the spotlight, it’s finally time to cater to them. In 2021, </span>mobile application development <span>will massively revolve around foldable devices, among other things. </span></p>
<p><span>The new year will be the high time for </span>mobile app developers<span> to offer user-friendly experiences through their apps for foldable screens. Additionally, </span><b>mobile app development companies</b><span> will have to shift their development strategies accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span>To support such devices, the app must be developed for two display screens which when unfolded, visually appear as one. To optimize and design a customized user interface to facilitate the folds will be one of the biggest challenges yet rewarding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span id="Wearable_Technology"></span><b><br>
</b>Wearable Technology<span></span></h3>
<p><span>App development for Wearable tech is trending even today. But the question is how developers might influence the future direction of the mobile ecosystem in terms of wearable tech? The answer is simple. By providing rather seamless experiences through wearables such as healthcare and fitness monitors, smartwatches, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>The popularity and market expansion of these devices are only expected to grow. </span><span>The number of wearable devices is expected to reach<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/#:~:text=Connected%20wearable%20devices%20worldwide%202016%2D2022&amp;text=The%20number%20of%20connected%20wearable,than%20one%20billion%20by%202022."> over 1 billion by 2022</a>, hence the wearable market is on the rise. </span></p>
<p><span>Designing and developing meaningful applications that sync with user expectations will be challenging due to size limitations, computing processes, user experience, redefined UI/UX designs, integration with smartphones. Therefore functionality, speed, performance, security, etc are some of the lucrative factors to be considered in 2021.</span></p>
<h3><span id="Mobile_App_Security"></span><b><br>
</b>Mobile App Security<span></span></h3>
<p><span>Mobile App Security is every development company’s top priority as it can make or break businesses, and for obvious reasons. Everyone lives and breathes ‘the smartphone’, meaning users are not just scrolling the social media but also regularly accessing their company sensitive data through their smart devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keeping confidential information beyond the reach of bad actors is becoming increasingly important. </span></p>
<p><span>According to Ponemon Institute’s 2018 report, the average cost of a corporate data breach is worth <strong>$3.86 million</strong>. Moreover, security threats amid pandemic will continue to rise as more and more attackers will likely attempt to capitalize on the sensitive information either its healthcare or remote workforce.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So as we move into the new year, developers will ensure to fill in the security gaps and vulnerabilities in </span>mobile application development<span>. Mobile app security trends such as penetration testing will prove to be valuable.</span></p>
<h3><span id="Internet_of_Things_(IoT)"></span><b><br>
</b>Internet of Things (IoT)<span></span></h3>
<p><span>IoT never goes out of style! The IoT market in the US </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/688762/north-america-iot-market-by-application/"><span>is predicted to exceed</span></a><span> 500 billion dollars by the year 2022. IoT is changing the way people communicate and connect with their devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is one of the advanced technologies that is seen to be providing convenience in 2021 as well. The Internet of Things will become the most favored choice for</span><b> mobile app developers in 2021</b><span>. How?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The pandemic has gradually increased the need for healthcare applications. Therefore we can see a surge in IoT-powered medical applications. Instead of actually having to go to the doctor users can check their medical health status from the comfort of their homes. </span></p>
<p><span>Medical data will be uploaded using cloud computing, which doctors can access to suggest appropriate medical treatment. That’s just one use case, the implementations of IoT are boundaryless. Along with home automation, mobile apps can be integrated with smart cars for added innovation.</span></p>
<h3><span id="Ondemand_Service_Applications"></span><b><br>
</b>On-demand Service Applications<span></span></h3>
<p><span>This </span>mobile app development trend<span> is not new but we can surely see more of it as we step into the new year. <a href="https://invozone.com/blog/on-demand-home-service-apps-what-are-the-points-to-consider/">On-demand applications</a> are making lives simpler. We can get any service, anywhere, anytime. </span></p>
<p><span>These applications are leveraging the use of beacon technology to provide seamless customer experience within the vicinity such as food and grocery apps, ride-sharing, healthcare, and other related home services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Users globally prefer on-demand service apps as they are faster and easier to access. We can see many innovations in on-demand apps moving forward in terms of both simplicity and convenience.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span id="Country_SpecificMobile_App_Usage_Statistics_Canada"></span><b>Country Specific-</b><b>Mobile App Usage Statistics: Canada</b><span></span></h2>
<p><span>The use of mobile devices continues to grow. The amount of time spent on mobile phones has significantly increased over the years. Similarly, mobile phone users are gradually growing in Canada as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the following infographic, we have gathered some of the popular </span><b>app development industry statistics from Canada </b><span>specifically. From the </span>app revenue statistics<span>, we can see an insatiable appetite of users towards mobile app usage and downloading which as a result has created massive opportunities for the </span>mobile app development industry.</p>

<![CDATA[Introduction to Window Functions in SQL]]>

January 6, 2021 | https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    
                        <p>It is interesting that many people working with data have no clue about window functions in SQL. During the long period of time instead of using window functions I prefered coding on Python and <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/pandas-data-analysis/">pandas</a>. Today I would like to introduce you to the concept of "window" and how it is related to data extraction from a SQL database.</p>

<p><strong>Window functions</strong> are applied to a subset/window of rows related to one another. In comparison to <code>GROUP BY</code> operation, window functions do not decrease the number of rows. Aggregate functions like <code>AVG</code>, <code>SUM</code>, <code>COUNT</code> could be used as window functions as well. Usually window functions are used to do analytical tasks. The following examples of queries will be performed on PostgreSQL database.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;function&gt;(&lt;expression&gt;) OVER (
  &lt;window&gt;
  &lt;sorting&gt;
  &lt;window range&gt; -- optional
)</code></pre>
<p>Looks creepy 😲 We need more practice. Let's assume that we have a salary table:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/salary_table_1.png" width="80%" data-image="atvi5p4igh4g"></figure>
<p><!--more-->One day your boss approaches you, he wants to know who is the highest paid employee by department. We can use the <code>MAX</code> function to select the highest salary by each department.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    department,
    MAX(gross_salary) as max_salary
FROM Salary
GROUP BY 1;
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>

<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3273608550190378" data-ad-slot="9434009847"></ins>


<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/department_max_salary.png" width="80%" data-image="department_max_salary.png"></figure>
<p>In order to select the person with the highest salary by department we can use a subquery and <code>JOIN</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    t.gross_salary
FROM Salary
JOIN (
    SELECT
        department,
        MAX(gross_salary) as gross_salary
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY 1
) t USING(gross_salary, department);
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/highest_paid_employees.png" width="80%" data-image="highest_paid_employees.png"></figure>
<p>But the query looks verbose and dirty, maybe we can do the same with window functions? Sure. All you need to do is to set up a window for <code>MAX</code> aggregate function: </p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    MAX(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as max_gross_salary
FROM Salary;
</code></pre>
<p>The column <code>department</code> is a window. It means that employees from the same department is a subset or window of related rows. The result of the query:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/window_functions_highest_salary.png" width="80%" data-image="window_functions_highest_salary.png"></figure>
<p>As you can see we have the new column called <code>max_gross_salary</code> which shows the highest salary in each department. In order to retrieve the list of most paid employees we do the following:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (
         SELECT id,
                first_name,
                department,
                gross_salary,
                MAX(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as max_gross_salary
         FROM Salary
     ) t
WHERE max_gross_salary = gross_salary
ORDER BY id;
</code></pre>
<p>Now your boss asks you to prepare the report which shows the ratio of salaries by department and by the total wage fund because some departments have relatively low-income employees in comparison with other departments. You can solve it using subqueries:</p>
<pre><code>WITH gross_by_departments AS (
    SELECT
        department,
        SUM(gross_salary) as dep_gross_salary
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9, 2)) / dep_gross_salary * 100, 2) as dep_ratio,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9, 2)) / (SELECT SUM(gross_salary) FROM Salary) * 100, 2) as total_ratio
FROM Salary
JOIN gross_by_departments USING(department)
ORDER BY department, dep_ratio DESC
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/subqueries_salary_ratios.png" width="80%" data-image="subqueries_salary_ratios.png"></figure>
<p>As you can see Нина earns 71.4% out of HR department, but it is only 10.7% out of total wage fund. Аркадий on the other hand has 21.4% out of total wage fund and 41% out of IT department. Can we refactor the query to make it smaller and more readable? Yes! <strong>Window functions</strong>!</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9,2)) / SUM(gross_salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) * 100, 2) as dep_ratio,
    ROUND(CAST(gross_salary AS numeric(9,2)) / SUM(gross_salary) OVER () * 100, 2) as total_ratio
FROM Salary
ORDER BY department, dep_ratio DESC; 
</code></pre>
<p>The expression <code>OVER()</code> means that the "window" is all rows.</p>
<h2>Window functions only</h2>
<p>We used the aggregate functions <code>MAX</code> &amp; <code>SUM</code> as window functions above. But SQL standard consists of functions which cannot be used as aggregates hence no way to apply them during grouping. Here is the list of them:

</p>
<ul>
<li>first_value</li>
<li>last_value</li>
<li>lead</li>
<li>lag</li>
<li>rank</li>
<li>dense_rank</li>
<li>row_number</li>
</ul>
<p>The comprehensive list of all window functions supported in PostgreSQL you can find <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Using window functions</h3>
<p>Let's use the <code>first_value</code> function in order to solve the very first problem where we were asked to get the name of the highest paid employee by each department. The function returns the very first values according to the provided window.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    department,
    gross_salary,
    first_value(first_name) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY gross_salary DESC ) as highest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>We are sorting the rows in our window by salary in a descending order, it means that the very first row will be a person with the highest salary.</p>
<p>Now let's use <code>last_value</code>. It does the opposite of what <code>first_value</code> does.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT id,
       first_name,
       department,
       gross_salary,
       last_value(first_name)
       OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY gross_salary DESC) AS lowest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/lowest_paid_employees_last_value_window_function.png" width="80%" data-image="lowest_paid_employees_last_value_window_function.png"></figure>
<p>If you look at the table you will see that the result is wrong. Why? Because of window ranges. By default if you provide the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause the window range is all preceding rows and current row, in SQL terms it is <code>ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</code>. It means that the <code>last_value</code> for a particular column in a particular row is a column in the same row. In order to fix this problem we need to change the range to <code>ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT id,
       first_name,
       department,
       gross_salary,
       last_value(first_name)
       OVER (
           PARTITION BY department
           ORDER BY gross_salary DESC
           ROWS BETWEEN
               UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
               AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
           ) as lowest_paid_employee
FROM Salary
</code></pre>
<p>This is how it looks visually:</p>
<figure><span id="selection-marker-start">﻿</span><span id="selection-marker-end">﻿</span><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/unbounded_preceding_current_row_unbounded_following.png" data-image="r9u3sqk8i9v7"><span id="selection-marker-start">﻿</span><span id="selection-marker-end">﻿</span></figure>
<p>The possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>N PRECEDING, N number of rows until current row</li>
<li>CURRENT ROW</li>
<li>UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</li>
<li>UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</li>
<li>N FOLLOWING**, N number of rows following current row</li>

</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-12-23">December 23, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few weeks ago, we wrote a massively successful <a href="#">IMGZ systems architecture article</a> that ended up going viral (note to editor: are we still allowed to say "viral" in 2020?) and upending the world of image hosting.
Here we were, a small newcomer, poised to take on the giants of the multi-billion-dollar image hosting industry with our new, innovative and daring business model of charging people for services.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, all the media attention caused our user count to skyrocket, and our subscription graph started exhibiting the familiar "hockey stick" pattern that every VC in Silicon Valley wants to be hit with:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/iQYRKWrE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, such an influx of new users caused a deluge of new content being uploaded to the platform. We estimate that, with our current level of usage, up to a thousand images could be getting uploaded to the service every year.</p>
<p>Naturally, we immediately sprang into action to preserve the reliability of our infrastructure, and quickly drew up a scaling plan that would enable the service to withstand its newfound popularity. This is where our foresight when designing the service paid off, as the hosting provider we use let us quickly perform the necessary changes and provision an extra gigabyte of disk space.</p>
<h2>One thing becomes clear</h2>
<p>However, one thing became clear: We could not sustain this breakneck pace for long by ourselves. This was never more obvious than a few days ago, when we realized we were close to failing to meet our uptime guarantee for 2020, and had to take the service offline for a few days to bring our uptime down to what we promised.</p>
<p>This event highlighted that there is just too much to do in a fledgling startup that aims to become the next MySpace, and even more to do in one that specifically wants to <em>avoid</em> becoming the next MySpace. If we were ever to realize the IMGZ vision and change the world, we needed more people.</p>
<h2>We're hiring!</h2>
<p>If you're young, passionate about creating software that changes the world and don't know what "3x investor preference" means, you're exactly who we're looking for! You have the opportunity to join an innovative, fast-growing company with a modern technology stack.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we don't just want to serve images, no. The values of IMGZ are far loftier than that. At IMGZ we live and breathe images to the point where our values can only be communicated <strong>with</strong> an image:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/i9xyk2H2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In talking with various prospective hires, one thing became abundantly clear: Nobody joins a startup for the money, they do it to get rich. With this in mind, we found the perfect balance of the "early startup employee" compensation package: 50% stock, 50% equity, 0% salary.</p>
<p>That's right! We can maximize the potential of your stock by doing away with a significant company expense: Employee salaries. This way, your stock is much more likely to be worth a lot more (and you have a lot of it, since our packages start at three trillion shares per employee! That's a big number).</p>
<p>Everyone we discussed this with loved the approach, and it makes intuitive sense: Name one Google employee who became a millionaire from their salary. We bet you can't, yet all of us know the name of that cleaning lady who was given Google stock and now she has "VC" on her CV, you know the one we're talking about.</p>
<h2>Interview process</h2>
<p>Like any self-respecting Silicon Valley startup, we can't just settle for any old 10x rockstar developer who wants to join. Firing people is expensive, you know? That is why we have prepared a thorough, six-stage interview process.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a pragmatic, practice-driven development team, and we want to see how you perfom in real-world scenarios, so you will be given a feature from our product roadmap and will be asked to develop it to your satisfaction. Afterwards, we will use this feature in our product and see how users like it. If they do, that will be a point in your favor.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't really know if you developed the feature yourself or paid someone on Fiverr to do it for you, so for the next stage of the interview we will ask you to invert a data structure on a whiteboard. None of us knows how or cares enough about what you're doing, so we'll pretend to not like random things about your solution until you're on the verge of tears, to evaluate how you fare against the ever-changing requirements that come with bad leadership.</p>
<p>If you pass the whiteboard interviews without cracking, we'll introduce you to everyone on the team, making sure you have at least eight hours of one-on-one time with various staff members, often more than once. This is just so we get to know you better and see what you're like in social situations.</p>
<p>After wasting a few days of your time and ours, we'll finally adjourn and haphazardly email each other about you, mostly trying to remember which applicant you were from flaws in your appearance. We'll then round up all the notes and observations from your technical interviews and summarize everything we know about you into one list.</p>
<p>For the final decision, we'll look at the list and evaluate you purely on your technical merits, trying to confirm the judgment that we've already subconsciously formed based on how much you are like us. If you are too different, we're sorry, no matter how good you are technically, we'll pass. In this company, we value one thing above all others: Diversity.</p>
<h2>Apply today!</h2>
<p>If the above sounds appealing, excellent! Reach out to us at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><span data-cfemail="8be3e2f9e2e5eccbe2e6ecf1a5e8e4e6">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to get the ball rolling, and you might soon be "working" for the best image host in the world, IMGZ!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span><strong>HTML5</strong> live streaming solutions have become more popular lately. One of them is the <strong>HLS protocol</strong>. There are some reasons why this is so popular, the most important of which is that RTMP lost its support by the end of 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2017, Adobe announced that Adobe will no longer support <strong>RTMP</strong> after the end of 2020. After this date, the question of what is HLS gained more importance. </span><span>So, we are in the last days of Adobe’s RTMP protocol.</span></p>
<p><span>But will it be beneficial for viewers and broadcasters to switch to HLS and therefore HTML5? We mentioned one of the most important reasons above. </span><span><strong>HTTP-based protocols</strong> deliver the best video quality and viewer experience possible regardless of the connection, software, or device.</span></p>

When to Use It? 1"><span>Other reasons for this transition are that HTML5 and HLS streaming protocols, which have revolutionized the live streaming world, are safer, more reliable, and much faster than “old” technologies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, it is necessary to plan this change process well. Although HTML5 protocols are exciting technologies, the transition to HTML5 protocols requires time and effort. As we said, HTML5 standards deeply affected the live streaming world.</span></p>
<p><span>In this blog post, you will find the answer to the question of what is HLS streaming and at the same time, you will see why you should switch your live streaming solution to HLS from HTML5 solutions. </span></p>

<p><span>So, what is HLS? HLS stands for HTTP Live Streaming. </span><span>HLS is an adaptive HTTP-based protocol used for transporting video and audio data from media servers to the end-user’s device.</span></p>
<p><span>HLS was created by Apple in 2009. Apple announced the HLS at about the same time as the legendary device iPhone 3. Earlier generations of iPhone 3 had live streaming playback problems. Apple wanted to fix this problem with HLS.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Features of HLS video streaming protocol</strong></h3>

<h2><span>Apple Low-Latency HLS</span></h2>
<p><span>Apple explained Low Latency HLS as</span></p>
<p><i><span>Low-Latency HLS extends the protocol to enable low-latency video streaming while maintaining scalability. The new low-latency mode lowers video latencies over public networks into the range of standard television broadcasts.</span></i></p>
<h2><span>What is a Protocol?</span></h2>

When to Use It? 3"></p>
<p><span>Yes, HLS is a live streaming protocol. But, it is useful to explain this term protocol, which we constantly hear.&nbsp; So, What is a streaming protocol? A streaming protocol is a standardized method of transmitting video or audio content between devices over the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>A video streaming protocol sends “chunks” of video or audio content from one device to another device. The method of converting these “chunks” into replayable content on the player device is called the “</span><span>reassembling</span><span>” method.</span></p>
<p><span>For a successful process, the end device must support the protocol used by the sender. Otherwise, it will not be possible to play the broadcast. Another important point is that the protocol is thought to mean the same as the codec.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>What is a codec? </span></h2>
<p><span>Codecs are compression technologies with two components; an encoder to compress the file in the first device and a decoder to decode the file when played by the end device(viewers)</span></p>
<p><span>HLS supports many popular codecs such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Audio: </span><span>AAC-LC, HE-AAC+ v1 &amp; v2, xHE-AAC, Apple Lossless, FLAC</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Video: H.265, H.264</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>How Does HLS Work?</span></h2>
<p><span>Now that we’ve answered the question of what is HLS video streaming, we can go one step further. Before comparing HLS with other solutions, it would be better to learn how HLS works.</span></p>
<p><span>HLS works like all adaptive streaming technologies; Multiple files are created for distribution to the player, which can adaptively change streams to make the viewer’s experience “perfect”. Since it is an HTTP based technology, no streaming server is required, so all adjustments are made on the player device.</span></p>
<p><span>To distribute to HLS clients, the source is encoded into multiple files at different data rates and divided into short chunks(segments of data), usually around 10 seconds long. This process is also called segmented delivery. </span><span>These are loaded onto an HTTP server along with a text-based manifest file with a .M3U8 extension that directs the player to additional manifest files for each of the encoded streams.</span></p>
<p><span>Segmented delivery allows the player to shift between different video qualities depending on available resources of viewers’ conditions, while also driving down latency.</span></p>
<h2><span>Advantages of HLS Streaming</span></h2>
<p><span>The biggest advantage of HLS is its wide support area. HLS is currently the most used streaming protocol. However, the HLS protocol offers a latency of 5-20 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>HLS’s adaptive-bitrate capabilities ensure that broadcasters deliver the optimal user experience and minimize buffering events by adapting the video quality to the viewer’s device and connection.</span></p>
<p><span>Players can automatically adapt and adjust for changes in network speed, preventing stalls when the local connection is unstable.</span></p>
<h2><span>Devices and Browsers that Support HLS</span></h2>
<p><span>As we said, the HLS streaming protocol is supported by a wide range of devices and browsers.</span></p>
<p><span>Limited to iOS devices such as iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch at the time of its release, HLS is now supported by the following devices and browsers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>All Google Chrome browsers</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Safari</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Microsoft Edge</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>iOS devices</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Android devices&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Linux devices</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Microsoft devices</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>macOS platforms&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>When to use HLS?</span></h2>
<p><span>As we said, HLS is currently the most used streaming protocol. That’s why live broadcasters have definitely heard of HLS. HLS can be used in streams where video quality is important but latency is not much more important. Examples include Sports Competitions and event broadcasts.</span></p>
<h2><span>When Not to use HLS?</span></h2>
<p><span>If you care about delay and interaction in your broadcasts, HLS is not for you. If you are looking for a solution in a field such as video conferencing, game shows, the best and only solution for you is WebRTC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>HLS vs RTMP</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flash-vs-html5.png" alt="flash vs html5 protocols" width="800" height="355" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flash-vs-html5.png 800w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flash-vs-html5-300x133.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flash-vs-html5-768x341.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flash-vs-html5-600x266.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="What is HLS Streaming Protocol? When to Use It? 5"></p>
<p><span>RTMP is a protocol, created by Macromedia and now owned by Adobe, that provides high-performance transmission of video, audio, and data between dedicated streaming servers and Adobe Flash Player across the internet. RTMP is created for high-performance transmission of media such as audio and video data.</span></p>
<p><span>But…We are at the end of 2020. That means this is the death time of Flash Player and also RTMP. Adobe will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player. We said above that HLS is the most popular protocol. With the fall of RTMP, this popularity seems to increase even more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Time to move from RTMP to HTML5 solutions.</span></p>
<h2><span>HLS vs WebRTC</span></h2>
<p><span>We answered the question of what is HLS streaming and talked about HLS enough and learned its positive aspects. The worst feature of HLS is that it provides high latency. If latency is important to you, WebRTC is the right choice.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-video-streaming/">WebRTC</a>(Web Real-Time Communication protocol) is an open-source standard for real-time communication supported by almost every modern browser, including Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and others.&nbsp; That support ensures that the WebRTC standard remains up to date and functional for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to WebRTC video streaming technology, you can embed the real-time video directly into your browser-based solution to create an engaging and interactive streaming experience for your audience without worrying about the delay. WebRTC provides sub-second delay – 0.5 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the other most important features of HLS was its scalability. On the other hand, WebRTC successfully responds to the need for scaling. Here’s our blog post on <a href="https://antmedia.io/mass-broadcasting-with-ant-media-webrtc-solution/">scaling WebRTC to 70k viewers</a>.</span></p>
<p>As a result, the HLS streaming protocol is a protocol that every broadcaster should have on one side of his/her mind. <span>Ant Media Server supports </span><span>WebRTC, CMAF, HLS, RTMP, RTSP, and much more.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://antmedia.io/free-trial/">You can try</a> Ant Media HLS solutions for free.</p>
<p>We found an answer to the question of what is HLS and examined the HLS protocol in depth. We hope it was a useful blog post for you.</p>

<p>
<b>NoisePage</b> is a relational database management system (DBMS) designed from the ground up for autonomous deployment. It uses integrated machine learning components to control its configuration, optimization, and tuning. The system will support automated physical database design (e.g., indexes, materialized views, sharding), knob configuration tuning, SQL tuning, and hardware capacity/scaling. Our research focuses on building the system components that support such self-driving operation with little to no human guidance. We seek to create a system that not only able to optimize the current workload, but also to predict future workload trends and prepare itself accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the <b>NoisePage</b> project is to build a self-driving DBMS that will continue to operate on its own long after <u>you</u> are dead.
</p>
<p>
Our plan is for <b>NoisePage</b> to support the most common database tuning techniques without requiring humans to determine the right way and proper time to deploy them. It will also enable new optimizations that are important for modern high-performance DBMSs, but which are not possible today because the complexity of managing these systems has surpassed human experts' abilities.
</p>
<p>
This project is developed by students in the <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Database Research Group</a>.
Additional information about the DBMS's architecture is covered in CMU's <a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/">15-721 - Advanced Database Systems</a> course.

  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>One of the less known Vim features is “abbreviations”. It’s something similar to mapping, but it has a different purpose.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are a very flexible and really powerful tool.</p>
<p>For simplicity, this post will cover only the Insert mode abbreviations.
This is Part 1 of the post. Part 2 will be published soon.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="basic-use-of-abbreviations">Basic use of abbreviations</h2>
<p><strong>The command</strong><br>
The command for Insert mode abbreviations looks like this:</p>
<p><code>:iabbrev [&lt;expr&gt;] [&lt;buffer&gt;] {abbreviation} {expansion}</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> -  stands for Vimscript expression to create the expansion.</li>
<li><code>&lt;buffer&gt;</code> -  means that it only applies to the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>{abbreviation}</code> -  is the thing you type, or your “trigger”</li>
<li><code>{expansion}</code> - is your final outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything that’s inside a [] is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting typos</strong><br>
Let’s start with the simple commands first.</p>
<p>Run this command in your Vim: <code>:iabbrev teh the</code>. Now enter the Insert mode and type <code>teh end</code>.
As soon as you hit <kbd>Space</kbd> after typing the <code>teh</code>, Vim will replace it with <code>the</code>.</p>
<p>You probably have a few or more words which you misspell quite often. This is a good way to solve that problem.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding commonly used phrases</strong><br>
Of course, you can store all of your abbreviations in your <code>.vimrc</code> file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev @@ hi@jovica.org
iabbrev ccc Copyright 2020 Jovica Ilic, all rights reserved.
</code></pre><p>You’re coding in C? How about:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev #i #include
iabbrev #d #define
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s create one abbreviation with a Vimscript expression. We can use <code>strftime()</code> function.
If you run this command in Vim: <code>:put =strftime('%c')</code>, you’ll insert the current date and time in your current buffer.</p>
<p>So, we can do something like this with an abbreviation:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev &lt;expr&gt; ddd strftime('%c')
</code></pre><p>Save your <code>.vimrc</code>, open Vim and try them out. Cool, ha? :)</p>
<p>Basic text expanding and correcting spelling mistakes are just the tip of the iceberg. You can use abbreviations to generate entire code snippets.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="advanced-use-of-abbreviations">Advanced use of abbreviations</h2>
<p>Let’s create an abbreviation for generating a C style comment:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev cc /*&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;/&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>Basically, after you type <code>cc</code> in Insert mode and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, a code snippet like this is generated:</p>
<p>In the expression above, we basically told Vim to type <code>/*</code> then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice(<code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>), type <code>/</code> and hit the <kbd>↑</kbd> key.</p>
<p>If you have to write Java code for a living, you could add something like this to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>So every time you type <code>psvm</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you get a snippet like:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){

}
</code></pre><p><strong>File-type specific abbreviations</strong><br>
What if you want to use the same abbreviation for multiple programming languages? This is possible, as you can use abbreviations in auto commands. This way, you can create file-type specific abbreviations.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to make one abbreviation for printing a string in Python and Java.</p>
<pre><code>"python
autocmd Filetype python :iabbrev ppp print("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
"java
autocmd FileType java :iabbrev ppp System.out.println("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
</code></pre><p>With these lines in your <code>.vimrc</code>, you can now hit <code>ppp</code> and <kbd>Space</kbd>, and depending on the file type, you’ll insert an appropriate snippet for printing a string!</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at another, more complex example:</p>
<pre><code>autocmd FileType c iabbrev start #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \int main() {
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  printf("hello\n");
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  return 0;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \}
</code></pre><p>So if you open a <code>.c</code> file, type <code>start</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you’ll get the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

int main() {
      printf("hello\n");
        return 0;

}
</code></pre><p>This is pretty cool. But all these “Enters” and other keys we need to simulate make these expressions a bit overwhelming. There’s a better way!</p>
<p><strong>Vim commands in abbreviations</strong><br>
Let’s get back to the previous abbreviation we defined for Java:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>We can achieve the same result with the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;esc&gt;O
</code></pre><p>What happens here? Let’s see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>psvm</code> - our “trigger” expression</li>
<li><code>public static void main(String[] args){</code> - first part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> once</li>
<li><code>}</code> - second part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> once and entering the Normal mode</li>
<li><code>O</code> - Normal mode command, which puts you in Insert mode, one line above your current line</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of simulating every single keystroke, we can “hit” <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go to Normal mode. From there, we can run any command we want :)</p>
<p>How about creating a <em>for loop</em>, and placing our cursor in Insert mode, exactly where the cursor should be?</p>
<p>Here’s a simple C-style loop sample:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>&lt;=</span><span>NUM</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We could create an abbreviation like this:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev forl for (i=1; i&lt;=NUM; i++) {&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;Esc&gt;?NUM&lt;CR&gt;cw
</code></pre><p>What happens here:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first, we insert the first part of the string</li>
<li>Then we hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice, and insert the second part of the string (<code>}</code>)</li>
<li>After that, we hit <kbd>Esc</kbd></li>
<li>Then we perform a search backwards for string <code>NUM</code>, by “hitting” <code>?NUM</code> and <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
<li>Lastly, we run the <code>cw</code> command which stands for “change word”. This way we delete the string <code>NUM</code> and stay in the Insert mode, ready to type a desired value.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="theres-more">There’s more</h2>
<p>There’s much more to be said about abbreviations.</p>
<p>Here are just a few interesting bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like mappings, abbreviations can be local to a buffer.</li>
<li>Abbreviations are never recursive.</li>
<li>Abbreviations can be mapped.</li>
<li>To avoid the abbreviation in Insert mode, you can hit Ctrl-v before the character that would trigger the abbreviation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll cover things like these in the upcoming, Part 2, of this post.<br>
Also, abbreviations are something I’ll definitely cover in the new edition of <a href="https://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/">Mastering Vim Quickly: From WTF to OMG in no time</a>.</p>

<h2 id="carefully">carefully</h2>
<p>I frequently need to install software that’s not packaged for
installation by a package manager. I also frequently need to uninstall
that software. Unfortunately, uninstalling unpackaged software is not
always easy – <code>make install</code> is a familiar sight, but <code>make uninstall</code>
is less common, and even when it’s there, you have no guarantee that it
won’t do something terrible to your system.</p>
<p>If you, too, frequently need to install software which isn’t packaged
for your package manager, and you don’t have the time or the inclination
to learn the ins and outs of how to package software, and your package
manager is dpkg, then you may be interested in <a href="https://sorrel.sh/projects/carefully/">carefully</a>.</p>
<p>carefully runs <code>make install</code> (or any other install command) inside
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/11/18/how-containers-work--overlayfs/">overlayfs</a>, and keeps the filesystem changes it makes inside a
separate directory tree. It then creates a template <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html">Debian control
file</a> and opens it in your editor, and uses <code>dpkg-deb</code> to build
a Debian package from the captured files and the metadata you’ve
provided. You can then use any dpkg-based package manager to install
your software, in a way that makes it easy to uninstall later.</p>
<p>carefully is currently fairly rough-and-ready. It doesn’t perform any
checks on the package produced, so you will probably want to run
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/lintian/lintian.1.en.html">lintian</a> on the packages created, and check over the captured
directory tree to make sure that no extra files have been captured (for
example: overlayfs seems to eagerly copy_up processes’ working
directories, so assuming you build software somewhere in <code>/home</code>, you’ll
probably want to remove <code>.carefully/pkg-data/home</code>).</p>
<p>If you’d like to try carefully out, check out the <a href="https://sorrel.sh/projects/carefully/">project
page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jan">jan</h2>
<p>carefully needed some way of observing what files are created by <code>make install</code>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008140130/http://checkinstall.izto.org/">checkinstall</a> uses a program/library called installwatch to
do this, which works by replacing common file-handling functions using
an <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/11/27/ld-preload-is-super-fun-and-easy/">LD_PRELOAD</a> library; this kind of works, but it’s a
labour-intensive way of doing it, and it doesn’t work at all with
statically-linked binaries. I wrote an installwatch replacement called
<a href="https://sorrel.sh/projects/jan/">jan</a>, which uses Linux’s overlayfs to redirect filesystem modifications
to an isolated directory tree.</p>
<p>overlayfs has its quirks, but it’s certainly good enough for my
purposes. I can envision jan being useful for other projects besides
carefully, hence my decision to package and distribute it separately.</p>

    <p><em>An exploration of File Locking mechanisms and their pitfalls on Linux in Ruby.</em></p>

<p>On a recent automation spree I produced a couple of hundred lines of ruby that
needed persistence. The built-in <code>PStore</code> is a natural choice for a project that
size. I’ve got two tasks that make destructive writes to the same <code>db.pstore</code>,
and both could potentially be scheduled together. Here’s what the documentation
has to say about that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PStore objects are always reentrant. But if thread_safe is set to true, then
it will become thread-safe at the cost of a minor performance hit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But a <code>Mutex</code> isn’t helpful when you’ve got multiple <em>processes</em> writing to
the same resource on disk. Turns out, <code>PStore</code> also uses <code>File#flock</code> under the
hood, so if you’re in the middle of a write transaction, other processes trying
to transact will simply block, just like threads would in a thread-safe
environment. Let’s take a look at how it works.</p>

<h2 id="locking-files-with-flock">Locking Files with flock</h2>

<p>Consider the following piece of code, saved to a file <code>flock.rb</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># flock.rb</span>

<span>def</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>)</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"PID </span><span>#{</span><span>$$</span><span>}</span><span> - </span><span>#{</span><span>msg</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>acquire_lock</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span>
  <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>flock</span><span>(</span><span>File</span><span>::</span><span>LOCK_EX</span><span>)</span>
  <span>log</span> <span>"acquired exclusive lock on db"</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span>
  <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>$$</span><span>}</span><span> was here last!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>flush</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>print_file_contents</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span>
  <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>rewind</span>
  <span>log</span> <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>log</span> <span>"started!"</span>

<span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'datastore'</span><span>,</span> <span>File</span><span>::</span><span>CREAT</span> <span>|</span> <span>File</span><span>::</span><span>RDWR</span><span>)</span>

<span>acquire_lock</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span> <span>unless</span> <span>ARGV</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'no_lock'</span>

<span>write</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span>
<span>sleep</span> <span>10</span>
<span>print_file_contents</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The script acquires an exclusive lock(there’s also shared locks) and writes its
<code>PID</code> to it. The lock acquisition is skipped if you pass in <code>no_lock</code> as the
first command line parameter. If you open two terminal and run <code>ruby flock.rb</code>
in each, you will find that the process that starts second simply blocks until
the first process exists, and therefore each process prints out exactly what
<em>it</em> wrote to the file last. Now do that again, but invoke the second process as
follows <code>ruby flock.rb no_lock</code>. You’ll find that <em>process_2</em> doesn’t hesitate
writing its <code>PID</code> to the file, even though <em>process_1</em> is holding an exclusive
lock on it!</p>

<p>In practice, you would never see this because cooperating processes involved
would go through the correct <code>flock()</code> api.  Therefore, a few of you might find
this behavior unremarkable and perfectly acceptable.  We’ll get to that in a
second, but first let’s look at how <code>File#flock</code> actually works.</p>

<h2 id="fileflock-under-the-hood">File#flock Under The Hood</h2>

<p>A cursory inspection of the (ruby source) reveals that <code>File#flock</code> actually
uses the <code>flock(2)</code> system call. The <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/flock">manual</a>
defines it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>flock - apply or remove an advisory lock on an open file</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aha! So <code>File#flock</code> actually issues an advisory lock, which means that other
processes are free to ignore the locking protocol if they so desire. Advisory
locking is in contrast to <em>mandatory locking</em>, which prevents this sort of
thing from happening. Some environments, notably Windows(!), have certain
types of locks enforced by the filesystem by default! Ruby’s file locking
inherits all of <code>flock(2)</code>’s flaws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not cross-platform. The ruby documentation mentions this up front.</li>
  <li>No mandatory locking.</li>
  <li>Can only lock entire files. This is a big one. Imagine a heavily concurrent
system such as a database, with dozens of cooperating processes writing to
different parts of a file only being able to issue a single write at a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Linux provides another locking mechanism that addresses those last two points,
which we’ll look at next.</p>

<h2 id="partial-locking-with-fcntl">Partial Locking with fcntl</h2>

<p>Due to the performance implications of issuing locks on entire files, most
systems provide mechanisms to lock only parts of a file. On Linux, this is
provided by the <code>fcntl()</code> system call. To quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Linux_Programming_Interface">The Linux Programming
Interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This form of file locking is usually called <em>record locking</em>. However, this
term is a misnomer, because files on the UNIX system are byte sequences, with no
concept of record boundaries. Any notion of records within a file is defined
purely within an application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ruby ships with a poorly documented interface for <code>fcntl()</code> if the underlying
system supports it. Let’s take a look at some basic usage:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># partial_lock.rb</span>

<span>require</span> <span>'fcntl'</span>

<span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>sysopen</span><span>(</span><span>'/tmp/datastore'</span><span>,</span> <span>Fcntl</span><span>::</span><span>O_WRONLY</span><span>)</span>
<span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>open</span> <span>fd</span>

<span>pad</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<span># Acquire a lock for a 1 byte segment of the file starting at byte ARGV[0]</span>
<span># [l_type, l_whence, l_start, l_len, l_pid]</span>
<span>lock</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>Fcntl</span><span>::</span><span>F_WRLCK</span><span>,</span> <span>IO</span><span>::</span><span>SEEK_SET</span><span>,</span> <span>pad</span><span>,</span> <span>ARGV</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>to_i</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>$$</span><span>].</span><span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>"s!s!i!L!L!i!"</span><span>)</span>

<span>f</span><span>.</span><span>fcntl</span> <span>Fcntl</span><span>::</span><span>F_SETLKW</span><span>,</span> <span>lock</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"Acquired write lock"</span>

<span>sleep</span> <span>10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The example is a bit obtuse because the lock is expressed as a binary string.
Fortunately Ruby’s excellent <code>Array#pack</code> takes the pain out of creating it.
The lock format is implementation dependent, so if the above code doesn’t work
for you, <code>man fcntl</code> should have the correct order of arguments. On my Linux
system, the code attempts to acquire a write lock for a 1 byte segment of the
file <code>/tmp/datastore</code> starting at at byte supplied on the command line. So,
<code>ruby partial_lock.rb 1</code> will acquire a lock on a segment spanning bytes 1 and
2.</p>

<p>Open two terminals and play around with this. You should find that acquiring a
lock on the same segment should block if another process is already holding a
lock, but the operating system happily issues it to you if you try to acquire it
on a different segment.</p>

<p>It is possible to issue a mandatory lock with <code>fcntl()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="playing-nice-with-external-processes">Playing Nice With External Processes</h2>

<p>Since <code>File#flock</code> uses <code>flock(2)</code> under the hood, it stands to reason that we
can cooperate with other non ruby processes. The following C program plays nice
with our <code>flock.rb</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;sys/file.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>fd</span><span>,</span> <span>lock</span> <span>=</span> <span>LOCK_EX</span><span>;</span>

	<span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span> <span>(</span><span>"datastore"</span><span>,</span> <span>O_RDONLY</span><span>);</span>

	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>fd</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
		<span>exit</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>

	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>flock</span> <span>(</span><span>fd</span><span>,</span> <span>lock</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>errno</span> <span>==</span> <span>EWOULDBLOCK</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>puts</span> <span>(</span><span>"file is already locked!"</span><span>);</span>
		<span>}</span>
		<span>else</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>puts</span> <span>(</span><span>"could not acquire lock on file!"</span><span>);</span>
		<span>}</span>

		<span>exit</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>puts</span> <span>(</span><span>"acquired lock on file, sleeping for 10s"</span><span>);</span>

	<span>sleep</span> <span>(</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Polyglots rejoice!</p>

<h2 id="file-locking-in-shell-scripts">File Locking in Shell Scripts</h2>

<p>If your system supports <code>flock(2)</code>, in all likelihood it also ships with the
<code>flock</code> command line tool that lets you manage said locks in your shell scripts.
You can also use this to acquire a lock on an existing file descriptor, check
the manual for all sorts of examples. Try running the following on two separate
terminals:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>flock <span>'/tmp/datastore'</span> <span>-c</span> <span>"echo start; echo hi &gt; /tmp/datastore; sleep 5; echo end"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second invocation should block until the first exits. Really handy!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby supports synchronized file operations with <code>File#flock</code>.</li>
  <li>It relies on the <code>flock(2)</code> system call, which isn’t available on all systems.</li>
  <li>It can only issue a lock on the entire file, which is terrible for massively
concurrent systems.</li>
  <li>It only issues advisory locks, which means external processes are free to
ignore it completely.</li>
  <li>Linux provides a non-portable way to issue locks on parts of a file via
<code>fcntl()</code>. These can also be made mandatory if the underlying FS supports it.</li>
  <li>The <code>flock</code> utility lets you manage said locks on the command line.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://openfaas.com/blog">openfaas.com/blog</a> - OpenFaaS tutorials and news</li>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/blog">inlets.dev/blog</a> - case-studies, tutorials and news on inlets</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/">blog.alexellis.io</a> - my original blog for experiments, technical writing, tutorials that don't fit with one of the other brands.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@alexellisuk">medium.com/@alexellisuk</a> - blog posts that I think can be monetized</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been encouraging to see my posts trending on Hacker News, Reddit and Twitter, along with being included in newsletters like <a href="https://kubeweekly.io/">KubeWeekly</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/cronweekly/">cron.weekly</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the most popular blog posts from the year ranked by views:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I now have hundreds of blog posts going back several years, so it's difficult to read too much into the numbers, as it depends on how much traffic the site gets and where it has trended. A post on Hacker News could get 15k views overnight, and another more impactful post could get a steady stream of 3k per day from organic searches.</p>
<p>This year I've mainly focused on use-cases, and on capturing the imagination. In 2021, you'll see more of the same along with more guest posts on the blogs.</p>
<h2 id="bestinterviewsfeatures">Best interviews / features</h2>
<p>As part of <a href="https://github.com/readme">GitHub's readme program</a>, I was invited to write a feature-length piece on independent business and Open Source development</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readme/alex-ellis">Balancing open source sacrifice and success</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this gives you a deeper perspective on what it's like to be on the hook for a large OSS project.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/craigbox?lang=en">Craig Box</a> from Google reached out to me and asked me: "Why aren't you working for a FAANG company for 350K USD / year"?</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Craig had sketched out a brief history of my career in a Google Doc, and we were recording a podcast with his co-host</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/116-independent-open-source/">Kubernetes Podcast #116 - Independent Open Source</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how a developer at a payroll company became a Docker Captain, caused a stir with a prototype, and quit his job to create an independent software business.</p>
<h2 id="influentialreads">Influential reads</h2>
<p>I've read a number of books this year that have had an influence on me. I can't say that I finished them all, but I did get something from each that has helped me with my journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://neildavidson.com/downloads/dont-just-roll-the-dice-2.0.0.pdf">Don't just roll the dice</a> - a short guide to software pricing by Neil Davidson - this book taught me about the "pricing curve" - and how once a price rises above 0USD (think open source), you lose part of your potential market. There is a sweet spot on the curve. It also taught me about "price anchoring" - where a similar product becomes the way people expect your offering to be priced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoCFpb">Before The Exit: Thought Experiments For Entrepreneurs by Dan Andrews</a> - this book showed me that a product or project gives a platform and outlet, that once taken away can leave a void. It also challenged the idea that selling a business is the only successful outcome. And that receiving a windfall of cash, isn't necessarily as fulfilling as we would hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38H5okY">The Irresistible Consultant's Guide to Winning Clients by David A. Fields</a> - the main learning in this book is that success is found not in selling what you think you are able to, but in finding what pain a customer might have, and offering a solution that could help. Likewise, they need to sense urgency and enough pain to buy the solution. It also has to be simple enough to make sense to them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A good example of this would be Tailwind UI - a series of HTML and CSS snippets built by a designer and marketed to developers. Most backend developers are hopeless at making things look nice on a webpage.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3oaFQU5">The Visual MBA by Jason Barron</a> - having spent so much of my life giving all of the value I was creating away for free, this book helped me understand a framework for testing business ideas and iterating on them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, from a business and sustainability perspective, Open Source software fails its creators and only benefits its users.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoG0Vd">Start with Why by Simon Sinek</a> - the premise of this book was enough for me to stop and question things. When you're responsible for picking what you're working on, then asking Why? becomes even more important. Why did I start OpenFaaS? Why am I still working on it?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a why and challenging it over time could save us all a lot of wasted time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common theme in all of these books was that customers buy ways to reduce and remove pain. It needn't be a 10x improvement, but it should be an obvious solution, and they need to have a sense urgency about fixing the problem.</p>
<p>I would also say that I've become more aware of "Indie Hackers" - these are solo developers who come up with what's usually a very trivial idea, but execute on it hard. One example that caught my attention was a service that just <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">makes banner images for blog posts</a>. That was it. That was the product. From the outside, it looks like a simple idea that is easily copied, but by pressing in, he is now earning 8k USD per month from a platform, which I imagine costs very little to run.</p>
<p>When I compare this to my journey with OpenFaaS, and consider that its <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">recurring revenue on GitHub Sponsors</a> is only around 500 USD / mo, from one end-user company, it makes me question the ideology of Open Source Software.</p>
<h2 id="projecthighlights">Project highlights</h2>
<h3 id="inletscloudnativetunnels">inlets - Cloud Native tunnels</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>inlets was created to make tunnels something we could self-host, to get away from the limitations of SaaS products, and to integrate deeply with VMs, containers and Kubernetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year I launched a landing page and blog for <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a>. To begin with it was just a few pieces of Tailwind UI tied together that showed pricing and features. It was a starting-point, but then over time it's evolved and now even has its own blog with guest posts.</p>
<p>Highlights for inlets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inlets blog launched - the first post was about my inlets presentation on <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/08/advanced-cloud-patterns.html">"Advanced cloud patterns" at cert-manager's community day</a>. Since then I've seen several guest posts and an uptick in visits to the domain because of SEO and social sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business customers - inlets PRO has seen lots of customer interest over the year, and had its first business customers. I've got used to qualifying leads, following-up on free trials and more used to rejection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a>/<a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> providers - both gained new cloud providers like Hetzner, Azure and Vultr. I couldn't have done this without the support of the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/tag/0.7.0">inlets OSS + PRO syntax</a> - both were quite different and are now almost identical to help with adoption and to make it more intuitive for new users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal customers - some customers feel the price is fair, others expect it to be free. This is just the pricing curve doing its thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most personal customers are choosing inlets PRO to enable their local development, self-hosting needs or to get <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/self-hosting-kubernetes-on-your-raspberry-pi/">Ingress into their homelabs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It only takes a few seconds to create a tunnel server with inletsctl, but next year, if there's enough interest then I may look into building a managed inlets service.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="openfaasserverlessfunctionsmadesimple">OpenFaaS - Serverless Functions Made Simple</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My top highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> adoption and reception</li>
<li>Writing <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introduction-to-serverless-linuxfoundation/">Introduction to Serverless Kubernetes for the LinuxFoundation</a></li>
<li>Going fully multi-arch for all OpenFaaS projects</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-functions-with-github-actions/">Moving the templates to multi-arch with buildx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/birthday-invite/">Celebrating the 4th Birthday with the community</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For OpenFaaS my highlight would be <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>. faasd was initially an experiment to see if <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> would make a good back-end for functions instead of Kubernetes. By removing the support for clusters which have natural latency through their event-drive nature, things like cold-starts got so rapid, that they stopped existing. The cost to run OpenFaaS dropped from "a Kubernetes cluster" to a 3 EUR / mo VPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're still only scratching the surface of what faasd will mean for the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You end up with something that costs less than cloud functions, and has a much better developer experience, with the ability to "scale-up" into Kubernetes in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnZJXI377ak">Meet faasd. Look Ma’ No Kubernetes!</a> - a 10 minute video overview of the use-case, the differences, and how people are using it in production already.</li>
</ul>
<p>See it in action in this community blog post: <a href="https://myedes.io/stripe-serverless-webhook-faasd/">Tracking Stripe Payments with Slack and faasd</a></p>
<h3 id="arkadeportablekubernetesmarketplace">arkade - portable Kubernetes marketplace</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a></li>
</ul>
<p>arkade now has 40 apps that you can install with one command, and dozens of CLIs that you can install much quicker than using brew or apt-get. This year I've seen around half a dozen projects copy the approach arkade uses to fetch binaries, so I think we're on to something there.</p>
<p>Its real value comes in compounding - when you need several CLIs or Apps for a tutorial or cluster, the speed-up in getting something deployed is huge.</p>
<p>Want self-hosted OpenFaaS, with a public IP and TLS certificate, but running on your laptop, with KinD?</p>
<pre><code># Get your CLIs
arkade get kind
arkade get kubectl
arkade get faas-cli

# Create that cluster
kind create cluster

# Deploy inlets-operator to get a public IP for your IngressController
arkade install inlets-operator \
  --token-file $HOME/digitalocean-token \
  --region lon1 \
  --license-from …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div>

We talked about <a href="https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/covid-19s-impact-on-plastic" target="_blank">COVID's impact on plastic</a> in the July edition of our newsletter, but I&nbsp;wanted to learn more about what's being done to solve the single-use PPE problem. So, I found Beau!</p><p>‍</p><p>Beau Wangtrakuldee is a PhD chemist-turned entrepreneur who is the founder/CEO of <a href="https://www.amorsuiclothing.com/" target="_blank">AmorSui</a>, a company that provides size-inclusive personal protective equipment (PPE) that is chemical/fire-resistant, antimicrobial and properly fitted for women in STEM fields. But amidst the current pandemic, Beau shifted her business model to support the frontline as well as society and has introduced gender-inclusive and washable PPE that can be managed by mobile application.</p></div><div><h3>Fight climate change in a way that works for you.</h3><p>💌 Thinking about sustainability can be overwhelming after a busy workday, so we're here to help.

I am a trained PhD organic chemist and had a chemical spill accident where my lab coat did not protect me, when it should have. After the incident, I was looking for protective clothing to provide additional protection for myself and found that there are limited options for functional and size inclusive products, especially for women. This discovery drove me to start AmorSui, which mean “self-love” in Latin, to provide PPE for everyone and offer more options especially in smaller sizes.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>What does size inclusivity mean and why is it important?</strong><p>A survey of 3,086 women working in emergency services, transport manufacturing, construction, R&amp;D, and nuclear energy reported that only 29% of PPE they wear is designed for women. Additionally, 57% of respondents reported that their PPE sometimes or significantly hampers their work. Specifically, in healthcare the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has highlighted how ill-fitting PPE could be the difference between life and death. In a real-life example, 77% of NHS workers are female and have to wear gloves, face masks, gowns, and face shields that are too big, making them less effective in providing a complete barrier to the virus. Because of the limited option of PPE for women and individuals with smaller frames, they are risking their lives and have had their performance hindered by ill-fitting PPE. </p><p>‍<em>(Soapbox note: although we don't have the link to the aforementioned survey, here's a </em><a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/PPEandwomenguidance.pdf"><em>thorough report</em></a><em> with similar conclusions.)<br>‍<br>‍</em></p></li><li><strong>What got you interested in adding a sustainability aspect?</strong><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, significant plastic waste from disposable PPE (~2M tons produced daily) <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1314" target="_blank">will end up in landfills</a>, and later in oceans. Each plastic article that follows this route could last over <a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/the-lifecycle-of-plastics" target="_blank">450 years</a>. Without alternative solutions, the world would have to process these plastics for years to come. For the past three years, AmorSui has assembled a team with expertise in textile engineering, garment manufacturing, and software development, and we came up with sustainable solutions which enable healthcare organizations to adapt washable PPE products and recycle them properly.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Tell me more about your medical gowns that you're working on.</strong><p>The easiest probable solution to reduce plastic waste from disposable PPE is the implementation of washable and recycle PPE. </p><p>In fact, the FDA has provided guidance on conservation strategies, advising healthcare organizations to use washable gown and other PPE as much as possible. This is easier said than done because it is labor-intensive for hospitals to source durable products, manage logistics, track cleaning data, and measure the environmental and sustainability impacts of their implementation. </p><p>AmorSui provides a one-stop shopping solution to help hospitals implement sustainable washable gowns. We started by crafting a line of safety certified washable isolation and surgical gowns, available in 5 sizes instead of the typical one-size fits all model. We also automated the logistics for our customers and provided real-time data-tracking for how many times individual gowns are washed, but also measurements of the environmental impact (including reduced lbs of plastic waste, water, and carbon footprint) of switching from disposables to reusable gowns over time. After the gowns are retired, we partnered with a waste processor to recycle the gowns into textiles that can be manufactured into our gowns or by-products such as water bottles to donate to organizations in need. Our sustainable platform offers a simple and easy process for hospitals to implement carbon-zero sustainable PPE. We are piloting this solution at a 60,000-gown level with a large healthcare hospital with sustainability excellence in 2021, and are looking to expand our offerings to small offices where these solutions are needed, and to expand our product line to include other PPE items such as booties, scrubs, and scrub hats.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Are you only focused on hospitals?</strong><p>Due to the shortage of PPE, we have aligned a partnership with a leading healthcare system with commitment to sustainability. In 2021, we are putting plans in place to expand our sustainable platform to a wider audience. Small offices would be able to select our gowns to be freshly delivered at any frequency they would like, and will be able to track their environmental impact in real-time. We have also partnered with <a href="https://getusppe.org/" target="_blank">Get US PPE</a>, the US’s largest nonprofit donating PPE to people in need, to offer our sustainable solution to nursing homes, rural communities, homeless shelters, and schools.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Before you came along, how were businesses dealing with this problem?</strong><p>US hospitals have relied heavily on disposable gowns, which account for over <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32128776/" target="_blank">84% of all gowns used</a>. Hospitals used washable gowns at certain points in the past, but due to the labor-intensive management and unreliable tracking of cleaning life cycles, the majority of these hospitals chose to use disposable gowns instead since they are more convenient. Hospitals that are using washable gowns have no visibility into the life cycle of all gowns, cost-saving, and environmental impacts of choosing such products</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>One argument against sustainability is that it's too expensive. What's your take?</strong><p>When implemented properly, washable gowns are cheaper for hospitals in the long run on a per use basis. For example, an average isolation disposable gown costs $2 per gown. Hospitals would have to pay $2 per use and approximately $0.25 to process medical waste after gown use. </p><p>Our washable gown, which provides the same level of protection, would cost $1 per use and $0.50 for laundering, saving $0.75 per gown per use. In a typical COVID-19 ward, where the staff goes through almost 2,000 gowns per day, we could save $1,500 daily or $548K a year. Depending on the number of departments, hospitals could save in multiples of that.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>How are you tracking your impact?</strong>We have built a mobile app that tracks in real-time the number of gowns that are going through our system, how much disposable plastic waste we saved for each hospital by switching to washable gowns, and these data are compiled to provide information on carbon and water savings. Our laundering partner would capture these data for hospitals, so there little to no impact on the hospital’s workflow as no additional work is required on the hospital’s end.<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>How can others help you?</strong>We are actively looking to connect with innovative COOs, sustainability leads, or procurement leads at progressive hospitals, health systems, and smaller doctor’s offices, including your neighborhood dentists, fertility centers, and chiropractors that could benefit from our sustainable gowns solution.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I've been doubling down on my writing, I started to observe situations when I hedge. Hedging should be avoided, the writing advice goes, but I've found that it depends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many writers cushion their prose with wads of fluff that imply that they are not willing to stand behind what they are saying.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker (from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821371-the-sense-of-style">The Sense of Style</a>, p. 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one situation, a colleague asked about our website's unexpected behavior. I quickly investigated the issue and discovered that the most probable cause was a bug in the backend. So I replied: "It seems this is a bug in the backend." Such hedging, I realized, allows me to quickly communicate uncertainty in the case of the unknown. It's a shortcut I find acceptable.</p>
<p><img src="https://marcel.is/img/hedging-unknown.png" alt="hedging-unknown"></p>
<p>However, there are other situations. Once, I wrote: "It seems that the data connector is working." But this situation was different from the one above: I wrote the sentence <em>after</em> investigating the data connector, not before. I knew the connector, I knew the facts, yet I presented the outcome with hedging.</p>
<p>I can do better. Instead of cushion the uncertain generic conclusion with a safety net, I can organize the facts in a logical flow. I can write: "The  connector filled in the missing data for October. To declare the connector working, we need to check the connector's real-time ingestion." In this situation, the lack of hedging forces me to clarify my thoughts, which, in turn, helps others to understand the situation, the known, better.</p>
<p><img src="https://marcel.is/img/hedging-after.png" alt="hedging-after"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To write well, you need first to know what you are talking about. Thus, you have to do your research. ... Then you have to be able to organize your argument, at the level of the word, the sentence, the paragraph and the essay itself. If you can do that, you can organize your thoughts and, in consequence, your brain. Then you can help organize other brains, and other structures.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
						<p>Hi, welcome to this special tutorial. In here, I will be showing you how you can create a web-based desktop application using PHP, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript with the help of  <strong>PHP Desktop</strong>.
In fact, PHP Desktop is an easy and simple solution we can use to create a very powerful and complex desktop application.</p>
<h2>What is PHP Desktop?</h2>
<p>According to the official definition,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PHP Desktop is an open-source project founded by Czarek Tomczak in 2012 to provide a way for developing native desktop GUI applications using web technologies such as PHP, HTML5, JavaScript and SQLite. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop" target="_blank">- Source : Official Page of PHP Desktop</a></p>
<p>Mind you, the development workflow you are used to while creating web applications remains the same. The step of turning an existing website into a desktop application is basically a matter of copy and paste.</p>
<p>PHPDesktop is an all-made container that will just swallow your project. With that, you can easily transform an existing website into a desktop application without any modification. When you <a href="https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop#downloads" target="_blank">download</a> PHP Desktop, you will have some set of files and folders; among them, you will have a folder called <code>www</code> in which you will just paste your entire application. </p>
<p>For those who have used WampServer, Xamp or EasyPhp, it won't be a problem to understand the concept. When you are using these local servers, you usually create your projects into a particular folder called <strong>www</strong>, <strong>htdocs</strong>, or  <code>localweb</code>. It differs from one server to another, but the concept remains the same. That particular folder helps your webserver to know where to run your application (website) from.</p>
<p>PHP Desktop works the same way. The difference is that PHP Desktop does not require any particular installation; it is an all-in-one portable set of all these local servers have and it does all you can do with WampServer or Xamp and others in the same family.</p>
<p>PHP Desktop comes with a <code>.exe</code> file. Whenever you run that <code>.exe</code>, it will go into the <code>www</code> folder and run your index file. I am going to explain this process later in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>A bit of story</h2>
<p>Back in 2005, I remember once I was called for a store management application. The principle was simple, the manager should be able to add records of new stock and all sales. In the end, the owner should be able to have a clean report of each day and if possible he can select a date or a period.</p>
<p>I told the client I could do it but it will be web-based, so it will be using their browser to work. Even though I knew they don't understand what difference that makes it was necessary for me to try to make it clear for them. Fortunately, the client accepted it that way.</p>
<p>I made the application using EasyPhp. So to run the application, I had to install EasyPhp on the client's PC. You may tell me <code>oh yeah there is no problem in that</code>. Indeed, it seems like there is no problem, but such system/methodologies encounter a lot of problems such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>EasyPhp must be ON before the application runs otherwise they will receive a 404 error.</li>
<li>I had to install the entire EasyPhp with all its modules while I needed just a few.</li>
<li>Whenever EasyPhp refuses to start, they have to call me</li>
<li>If somebody mistakenly uninstalls EasyPhp thinking it is a strange software, the entire application goes with all the records. Pffff.</li>
<li>My database could easily be accessed.</li>
<li>My application could be hacked by anyone using my URLs because they were visible.</li>
<li>If they needed the same application in another store, I would have had to make the same process in that store by myself because they cannot install it themselves.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely, it wasn't the perfect solution. Even though I did not have any problem, I cannot consider it as a good solution. I was just lucky. After that I had two others I did in the same way but I was never satisfied with my work until I have come to meet <a href="https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop" target="_blank">PHP Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>I think you can understand the real problem we can face when it comes to desktop applications with PHP. I knew they must be a way; otherwise, my skills in PHP would have been used only for websites.</p>
<p>PHP Desktop comes to reduce (if not to solve) all these problems and gives a new horizon of software development experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no need again to embed all modules for nothing, only required ones.</li>
<li>No need to install any web server before, everything is embedded</li>
<li>No need to worry about browser compatibility because PHP Desktop comes with an embedded browser</li>
<li>The browser is very light and does not have all boring tools such as address bar, favorites bar, history bar, etc. After all, we will not need them.</li>
<li>You can make the entire application a <code>.exe</code> file and send it to your clients so that they can install it themselves</li>
<li>PHP Desktop can also act as a packager for pure HTML5/JS applications</li>
<li>No memory leaks</li>
<li>You can use it for Perl, Ruby, and Python</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not wonderful ?!</strong></p>
<h2>What do we want?</h2>
<p>Basically any PHP programmer would have liked to create any desktop application. Create an executable (<code>.exe</code>) application that he can easily share or sent to his client(s). Any client can simply install the application following an installation wizard without any struggle or any need of the programmer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you are really into PHP programming you should know by now that isn't actually possible. Since <em>PHP is an interpreted programming language</em> you can't compile your project files into a single executable (<code>.exe</code>) file, and that's where the big problem is.</p>
<p>Most programming languages that are specialized in desktop application like Java have some libraries that provide then some set of elements (button, menus, color, shapes, etc.) to help create a software interface. Actually PHP doesn't have such thing, PHP is fully a scripting language. People have tried to create some extensions ( like <a href="http://gtk.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP-GTK</a> ) to provide such ability to the language, but still the problem is remains not totally solved. </p>
<p>Furthermore, PHP can be combined with HTML and JavaScript. And we know HTML tags can be styled with CSS... getting better. We can't imagine the limits of CSS in terms of designing. So, that's where PHP Desktop takes its power from.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>PHP Desktop takes advantage of most web technologies to help PHP achieve our goal. PHP Desktop itself is a software that can embed yours in itself. So when you install PHP Desktop, you will now put your own application in PHP Desktop's folders. When you launch PHP Desktop it will go and read/parse your application therefor display/run it.</p>
<p><img src="https://lancecourse.com/assets/images/pics-articles/PHPDesk.png" alt="PHP Desktop folder"></p>
<p>PHP Desktop Embeds all services your application may need before running. The main elements are the web server (Mongoose), the PHP Server, and a database Engine (Sqlite). To provide universal interfacing it embeds a browser (actually Chrome or Internet Explorer). The browser now can help us interpret JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
<p>So there is no need to install any other server or parser before using it.
<img src="https://lancecourse.com/assets/images/pics-articles/phpdesktop.jpg" alt="PHP Desktop"></p>
<h2>Create your very first desktop application with PHP</h2>
<p>It is very simple to create a desktop application with PHP.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/#Downloads" target="_blank">Download PHP Desktop</a> (with Chrome or Internet Explorer)</li>
<li>Create a new folder and name it <code>MyApp</code></li>
<li>Unzip the content of PHP Desktop Inside</li>
</ol>
<p>You should have something like this in your folder <code>MyApp</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://lancecourse.com/assets/images/pics-articles/phpdesktop.png" alt="PHP Desktop"></p>
<p>I downloaded the one embedding Chome. No matter the one you have downloaded, what matters the most is the highlighted file, it is an executable (<code>.exe</code>) file.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Double click on that file to run it</li>
</ol>
<p>You should get something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://lancecourse.com/assets/images/pics-articles/PHPDesktoprun.png" alt="PHP Desktop"></p>
<h3>- What happened?</h3>
<p>PHP Desktop is very smart. When you clicked on the launcher, it went in a special folder to look for any available application, and this special folder is nothing than the <code>www</code> folder. Go ahead and open the <code>www</code> folder you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://lancecourse.com/assets/images/pics-articles/phpdesktopwww.png" alt="PHP Desktop"></p>
<p>Surprised!, these files are what PHP Desktop listed when we clicked on the launcher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: These files are .php files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on any of them. You should see its content.</p>
<p>These files are sample file to help you know that PHP Desktop can do everything these files are doing. Among them, you have functionalities like cookies, environment variables, forms, iframes, javascript, etc. That means your PHP application can do almost everything.</p>
<h3>- Why two windows prompted and what are they for?</h3>
<p>By default, PHP Desktop prompts up two windows. The first one (bigger) is chrome/explorer. This is where your application will reside. Users will interact with it through that window. You will be able to change it if you like.</p>
<p>The second window (small and black console) is the debugging interface (log console). It helps you see if any error occurred while running your application, very useful in <em>development phase</em>.</p>
<h3>- Another thing to notice</h3>
<p>You should know that in <em>production</em> we won't need that black console, and we may also need to resize the main window, etc; these are settings.</p>
<p>PHP Desktop comes with a special file called <code>settings.json</code>. This file will help us configure some behaviors of PHP Desktop.</p>
<p>So, for example if we don't want PHP Desktop to prompt the log console, we can open the <code>settings.json</code> file with any text editor and locate this:</p>
<pre><code>"debugging": {
"show_console": true,
"subprocess_show_console": false,
"log_level": "DEBUG4",
"log_file": "debug.log"
}</code></pre>
<p>Then change the value of <code>show_console</code> into false like that:</p>
<pre><code>"debugging": {
"show_console": false,
"subprocess_show_console": false,
"log_level": "DEBUG4",
"log_file": "debug.log"
}</code></pre>
<p>Then run PHP Desktop again. pfff gone!</p>
<h3>- Now, let's us add our own application</h3>
<p>Go in the <code>www</code> folder in your <code>MyApp</code> folder and delete all files inside.</p>
<p>Create a simple file and name it <code>index.php</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;MyApp&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;PHP Desktop is awesome&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;div style="background-color:blue; color:white; padding:2em; font-size:3em"&gt;
        &lt;?= "And PHP agrees!" ?&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>now move your <code>index.php</code> file in the <code>www</code> (if you didn't create it inside <code>www</code>) folder and launch PHP Desktop.</p>
<p>You should get something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://lancecourse.com/assets/images/pics-articles/myapp.png" alt="PHP Desktop"></p>
<p>You can see that PHP Desktop has recognized your <code>index.php</code> as the first file to launch. That's the job of the Mongoose server (the …</p></section></div>

<p>Any compiler or transpiler is doing some form of program synthesis. But “proper” program synthesis usually means generation of high level programs from scratch, given only high level problem descriptions.</p>
<p>This post is about one of the most simple and straightforward methods of automatic program synthesis: inductive synthesis based on <strong>input-output examples</strong> specification and <strong>brute-force enumerative</strong> search.</p>
<h3>Synthesis task specification</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple example. Suppose that we want to automatically generate a program that reverses an array.</p>
<p>How to formulate this task for the automatic program generator? One option is to just describe it in natural language. But it would be quite hard to automatically parse and understand. A simpler way is to provide examples of inputs and expected outputs:</p>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] → [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</p>
<p>[5, 2, 7, 6] → [6, 7, 2, 5]</p>
<p>It's similar to a programmer working on a task using test-driven development, with a set of self-explanatory tescases.</p>
<h3>Brute-force search</h3>
<p>How to find a program that satisfies some input-output examples? There are several possible search strategies, but the simplest one is just with a brute force enumeration.</p>
<p>The idea is to generate all programs (within some size liimts and a limited language subset), and pick the first one that works correctly for all specified examples.</p>
<p>This is probably the least efficient approach of all, but with some additional optimizations and heuristics for reducing the search space it can actually be practical.</p>
<p>For example, an algorithm that won last year's synthesis competition <a href="https://sygus.org/comp/2019/">SyGuS-Comp 2019</a> in programming-by-examples track, is based on brute-force enumerative search strategy. As well as some previous years winners (<a href="#examples" id="ref1">EUSOLVER, Enumerative CEGIS Solver</a>). There are even some practical applications, for example brute-force search can be used for <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462174">synthesising distributed systems protocols</a>.</p>
<h3>Generating Javascript</h3>
<p>For generating and manipulating programs, code has to be represented as a data structure. This is not a problem in homoiconic languages like Lisp, but in Javascript it’s harder.</p>
<p>One simple idea (used, for example in miniMAL project <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL">https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL</a>), is to use JSON for representing programs. In this case, JSON arrays are serving as an analog of Lisp s-expressions.</p>
<p>Similar to an s-expression, each JavaScript expression is represented as a JSON array. First element is a function name, and the rest of elements are for function arguments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong></td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong></td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Math.pow(x, 2)</td>
   <td>["Math.pow", "x", 2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Math.pow(Math.sin(x), 2)</td>
   <td>[“Math.pow”, [“Math.sin”,  “x”], 2]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For operators, can use prefix notation:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>x = 2 + 2</td>
   <td>["=", x, ["+", 2, 2]]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>There are some special expressions formats: control flow, variables declaration.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let x = 1
   </td>
   <td> ["let", "x", 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) { console.log(i) }
   </td>
   <td>["for”, ”i”, ”0”, ”10”, ”1”,["block", [“console.log”, “i”]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>if (i &gt; 1) { i = 1; }
   </td>
   <td>["if", [“&gt;“, “i”, 1], ["block", [“=“, “i”, 1]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Also need syntax conventions for calling methods, accessing properties, and indexing arrays:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>let a = new Array(0, 1, 2)
   </td>
   <td>["let", "a", ["new Array", 0, 1, 2]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a.shift()
   </td>
   <td>[".shift", "a"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n1 = a.length
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n1", [".length_", "a"]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n2 = a[1]
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n2", ["get_index", a, 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a[1] = 2
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", a, 0, 0]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This allows to represent a wide range of possible JavaScript expressions, and covers all language features needed for a simple demo.</p>
<p>Code for transforming from JSON representation to Javascript is fairly simple. It just has to traverse arrays, print out expressions elements in correct order, and deal with code formatting.</p>
<h3>Simple DSL</h3>
<p>For brute-force search to be feasible, search space has to be limited to some restricted domain-specific language subset, which depends on the kind of the target problem.</p>
<p>For example, can design a simple DSL targeted for simple array processing. It should have functions for array access and manipulation, simple arithmetics, and control flow functions.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>function</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>subtract
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? - number??
   </td>
   <td>["-", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>add
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? + number??
   </td>
   <td>["+", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>greater than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &gt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&gt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>less than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &lt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&lt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>equal
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? == number??
   </td>
   <td>["==", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>array length
   </td>
   <td>number = array??.length
   </td>
   <td>[".length_", "array??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>get array element at index
   </td>
   <td>number = array??[number??]
   </td>
   <td>["get_index", "array??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>set array element at index
   </td>
   <td>array??[number??] = number
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for loop
   </td>
   <td>for (let i in array??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["for", "i", ["block", "??"], "in", "array??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>If condition
   </td>
   <td>if (boolean??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""],
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In the DSL description, "??" stands for an undefined value, that can be replaced with an expression or a variable. This notation is taken from <a href="#sketch" id="ref2">SKETCH language</a>, where "??" represents a <em>hole,</em> a placeholder that the synthesizer can replace with an integer constant.</p>
<p>Some undefined values have annotated types. For example "number??" means that the argument should be replaced with an expression that has "number" return value. This allows for additional limitations on the search space.</p>
<h3>Algorithm for program generation</h3>
<p>How to generate all programs that can be represented with the DSL? The algorithm is fairly simple: start with some undefined values, and iteratively replace them with all possible options picked from the list of DSL expressions. Selected and pasted expressions would contain some undefined values of their own, so the process is repeated until all the options are used, or until expressions tree depth reaches some limit.</p>
<p>It’s like iterative template rewriting, and it’s easier to demonstrate with an example:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
	<td>1. Start with an empty/undefined program </td>
	<td>["??", "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2. Traverse the expressions tree, and pick the first occurring undefined value </td>
	<td>[<span>"??"</span>, "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3. List all options for replacing this value (expressions that have an empty return type) </td>
	<td><span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span><br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]<br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4. Repace undefined value with the first option </td>
	<td>[<span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span>, "??", "??" ,"??"] </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively. Expressions tree is traversed depth-first, and each found leaf corresponds to a unique program. Press “next” button in the demo below, to see next iterations.</p>


<div id="demo2">

	<p>
		Demo: iterative program generation
	</p>

	<p>step</p>
	<p>reset</p>

	
</div>

<p>Generated programs are verified with the given input-output examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate from JSON represenation to Javascript</li>
<li>Fill pre-defined input array variable with an example</li>
<li>Evaluate the program with eval()</li>
<li>Check if contents of the pre-defined output variable correspond to the output example.</li>
</ol>
<p>The demo below shows program generation for "array reversal" problem. Press “generate” button to see continuous generation, or use “next” to see generation steps. It generates and checks around a million of short programs per minute, and is able so solve the problem in ~10-20s. I tweaked the DSL to have a bare minimum of available expressions, for search to be faster. Size of the program is also limited by number of used varialbes (limited to 4). It would still work with larger more generic DSL, just would take more time.</p>

<div id="demo5">

	<p>

It&nbsp;is somewhat opinionated and forces us to follow its vision of how an application should look like to some extent. That might be viewed as a good thing that helps us to keep consistency across our application and forces us to follow good practices.</p><p>NestJS uses Express.js under the hood by default. If you’re familiar with my <a href="https://wanago.io/2018/12/03/typescript-express-tutorial-routing-controllers-middleware/">TypeScript Express series</a> and you’ve enjoyed it, there is a great chance you will like NestJS too. Also, knowledge of the Express framework will come in handy.</p><p>An important note is that the <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/">documentation of NestJS</a> is comprehensive, and you would benefit from looking it up. Here, we attempt to put the knowledge in order, but we also sometimes link to the official docs. We also refer to the Express framework to highlight the advantages of using NestJS. To benefit from this article more, some experience with Express might be useful, but not necessary.</p><blockquote><p>If you want to look into the core of Node.js, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://wanago.io/2019/02/11/node-js-typescript-modules-file-system/">Node.js TypeScript series</a>. It covers topics such as streams, event loop, multiple processes and multithreading with worker threads. Also, knowing how to create an API without any frameworks such as Express and NestJS makes us apprieciate them even more.</p></blockquote><h2>Getting started with NestJS</h2><p>The most straightforward way of getting started is to clone the official TypeScript starter repository. Nest is built with TypeScript and fully supports it. You could use JavaScript instead, but here we focus on TypeScript.</p><div id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4dc3596115136" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>git </span><span>clone</span><span> </span><span>git</span><span>@</span><span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>:</span><span>nestjs</span><span>/</span><span>typescript</span><span>-</span><span>starter</span><span>.</span><span>git</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>A thing worth looking into in the above repository is the&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4dcc049158221"><span><span>tsconfig</span><span>.</span><span>json</span></span></span>&nbsp;file.

</span><span>string</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The first thing that we can notice is that NestJS uses decorators a lot. To mark a class to be a controller, we use the&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4ddd041899529"><span><span>@</span><span>Controller</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>&nbsp;decorator. We pass an optional argument to it. It acts as a path prefix to all of the routes within the controller.</p><h3>Routing</h3><p>The next set of decorators connected to routing in the above controller are&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4de0627531931"><span><span>@</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>,&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4de2947588498"><span><span>@</span><span>Post</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>,&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4de3140383255"><span><span>Delete</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4de5175367951"><span><span>@</span><span>Put</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>. They tell Nest to create a handler for a specific endpoint for HTTP requests. The above controller creates a following set of endpoints:</p><blockquote><p>Returns all posts</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Returns a post with a given id</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Creates a new post</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Replaces a post with a given id</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Removes a post with a given id</p></blockquote><p>By default, NestJS responds with a <strong>200 OK</strong> status code with the exception of <strong>201 Created</strong> for the POST. <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers#status-code">We can easily change that</a> with the&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4df8968232553"><span><span>@</span><span>HttpCode</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>&nbsp;decorator.</p><p>When we implement an API, we often need to refer to a specific element. We can do so with&nbsp;<strong>route parameters</strong>. They are special URL segments used to capture values specified at their position. To create a route parameter, we need to prefix its name with the&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4dfa089900626"><span><span>:</span></span></span>&nbsp;sign.</p><p>The way to extract the value of a route parameter is to use the&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4dfc071620203"><span><span>@</span><span>Param</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>&nbsp;decorator. Thanks to it, we have access to it in the arguments of our route handler.</p><blockquote><p>We can use an optional argument to refer to a specific parameter, for example&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4dfe883268129"><span><span>@</span><span>Param</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>)</span></span></span>. Otherwise, we get access to the <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4e00874077862"><span><span>params</span></span></span>&nbsp;object with all parameters.</p></blockquote><p>Since route parameters are strings and our ids are number, we need to convert the params first.</p><blockquote><p>We can also use&nbsp;<strong>pipes</strong> to transform the route params. Pipes are built-in feature in NestJS and we cover them later.</p></blockquote><h3>Accessing the body of a request</h3><p>When we handle POST and PUT in the controller above, we also need to access the body of a request. By doing so, we can use it to populate our database.</p><p>NestJS provides a&nbsp; <span id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4e02520382660"><span><span>@</span><span>Body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></span>&nbsp;decorator that gives us easy access to the body. Just as in the <a href="https://wanago.io/2018/12/17/typescript-express-error-handling-validation/">TypeScript Express series</a>, we introduce the concept of a Data Transfer Object (DTO). It defines the format of the data sent in a request. It can be either an interface or a class, but using the latter gives us more possibilities and we explore them later on.</p><h6>createPost.dto.ts</h6><div id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4e04583455557" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>class</span><span> </span><span>CreatePostDto</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h6>updatePost.dto.ts</h6><div id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4e06694735775" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>class</span><span> </span><span>UpdatePostDto</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3>The arguments of a handler function</h3><p>Let’s look into the arguments of the handler function a bit more.</p><div id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4e08370928263" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>async </span><span>replacePost</span><span>(</span><span>@</span><span>Body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>UpdatePostDto</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>@</span><span>Param</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postsService</span><span>.</span><span>replacePost</span><span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>post</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>By using the method argument decorators, we tell Nest to inject particular arguments into our methods. NestJS is built around the concept of Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control. We elaborate on in a lot as we go through various features.</p><blockquote><p>Dependency Injection is one of the techniques that implement&nbsp;<strong>Inversion of Control</strong>. If you want read a bit more about IoC, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://wanago.io/2020/02/03/applying-solid-principles-to-your-typescript-code/">Applying SOLID principles to your TypeScript code</a></p></blockquote><p>An important note is that reversing their order yields the same result, which might seem counter-intuitive at first.</p><div id="crayon-5ff96f1fa4e0a290762139" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover wrap"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>async </span><span>replacePost</span><span>(</span><span>@</span><span>Param</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>@</span><span>Body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>UpdatePostDto</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postsService</span><span>.</span><span>replacePost</span><span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>post</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3>Advantages of NestJS over Express</h3><p>NestJS gives us a lot of things out of the box and expects us to design our API using <strong>controllers</strong>. Express.js, on the other hand, leaves us more flexibility but does not equip us with such tools to maintain the readability of our code.</p><p>We are free to implement controllers on our own with Express.

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p><strong>aeneas</strong> automatically generates a <strong>synchronization map</strong>
between a list of text fragments
and an audio file containing the narration of the text.
In computer science this task is known as
(automatically computing a) <strong>forced alignment</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, given
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readbeyond/aeneas/master/aeneas/tests/res/container/job/assets/p001.xhtml">this text file</a>
and
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readbeyond/aeneas/master/aeneas/tests/res/container/job/assets/p001.mp3">this audio file</a>,
<strong>aeneas</strong> determines, for each fragment, the corresponding time interval in the audio file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span>1                                                     =&gt; [00:00:00.000, 00:00:02.640]
From fairest creatures we desire increase,            =&gt; [00:00:02.640, 00:00:05.880]
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,           =&gt; [00:00:05.880, 00:00:09.240]
But as the riper should by time decease,              =&gt; [00:00:09.240, 00:00:11.920]
His tender heir might bear his memory:                =&gt; [00:00:11.920, 00:00:15.280]
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,         =&gt; [00:00:15.280, 00:00:18.800]
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, =&gt; [00:00:18.800, 00:00:22.760]
Making a famine where abundance lies,                 =&gt; [00:00:22.760, 00:00:25.680]
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:        =&gt; [00:00:25.680, 00:00:31.240]
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,         =&gt; [00:00:31.240, 00:00:34.400]
And only herald to the gaudy spring,                  =&gt; [00:00:34.400, 00:00:36.920]
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,             =&gt; [00:00:36.920, 00:00:40.640]
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:          =&gt; [00:00:40.640, 00:00:43.640]
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,              =&gt; [00:00:43.640, 00:00:48.080]
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.        =&gt; [00:00:48.080, 00:00:53.240]

</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>All-in-one installers are available for Mac OS X and Windows,
and a Bash script for deb-based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu)
is provided in this repository.
It is also possible to download a VirtualBox+Vagrant virtual machine.
Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas/blob/master/wiki/INSTALL.md">INSTALL file</a>
for detailed, step-by-step installation procedures for different operating systems.</p>

<p>The generic OS-independent procedure is simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install
<a href="https://python.org/">Python</a> (2.7.x preferred),
<a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>, and
<a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</a></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the following executables can be called from your shell:
<code>espeak</code>, <code>ffmpeg</code>, <code>ffprobe</code>, <code>pip</code>, and <code>python</code></p></li>
<li><p>First install <code>numpy</code> with <code>pip</code> and then <code>aeneas</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>pip install numpy
pip install aeneas
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>To <strong>check</strong> whether you installed <strong>aeneas</strong> correctly, run:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>python -m aeneas.diagnostics
</code></pre></div></li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Run without arguments to get the <strong>usage message</strong>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task
python -m aeneas.tools.execute_job
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also get a list of <strong>live examples</strong>
that you can immediately run on your machine
thanks to the included files:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task --examples
python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task --examples-all
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>To <strong>compute a synchronization map</strong> <code>map.json</code> for a pair
(<code>audio.mp3</code>, <code>text.txt</code> in
<a href="http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/textfile.html#aeneas.textfile.TextFileFormat.PLAIN">plain</a>
text format), you can run:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task <span>\</span>
   audio.mp3 <span>\</span>
   text.txt <span>\</span>
   <span>"task_language=eng|os_task_file_format=json|is_text_type=plain"</span> <span>\</span>
   map.json
</code></pre></div>
<p>(The command has been split into lines with <code>\</code> for visual clarity;
in production you can have the entire command on a single line
and/or you can use shell variables.)</p>

<p>To <strong>compute a synchronization map</strong> <code>map.smil</code> for a pair
(<code>audio.mp3</code>,
<a href="http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/textfile.html#aeneas.textfile.TextFileFormat.UNPARSED">page.xhtml</a>
containing fragments marked by <code>id</code> attributes like <code>f001</code>),
you can run:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task <span>\</span>
   audio.mp3 <span>\</span>
   page.xhtml <span>\</span>
   <span>"task_language=eng|os_task_file_format=smil|os_task_file_smil_audio_ref=audio.mp3|os_task_file_smil_page_ref=page.xhtml|is_text_type=unparsed|is_text_unparsed_id_regex=f[0-9]+|is_text_unparsed_id_sort=numeric"</span> <span>\</span>
   map.smil
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the third argument (the <em>configuration string</em>)
specifies the parameters controlling the I/O formats
and the processing options for the task.
Consult the
<a href="http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/">documentation</a>
for details.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have several tasks to process,
you can create a <strong>job container</strong>
to batch process them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>python -m aeneas.tools.execute_job job.zip output_directory
</code></pre></div></li>
</ol>

<p>File <code>job.zip</code> should contain a <code>config.txt</code> or <code>config.xml</code>
   configuration file, providing <strong>aeneas</strong>
   with all the information needed to parse the input assets
   and format the output sync map files.
   Consult the
   <a href="http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/">documentation</a>
   for details.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This story starts with me having to simulate a faulty disk device for testing.
The Linux Kernel Device mapper is a good solution for this, so i created a
faulty device with a simple file backend:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>truncate</span> <span>-s</span> 1G /tmp/baddisk
 losetup /dev/loop2 /tmp/baddisk
 dmsetup create baddisk <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>EOF</span><span> 
    0 6050 linear /dev/loop2 0
    6050 155 error
    6205 2090947 linear /dev/loop2 6205 
 EOF</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These commands setup a new device on <em>/dev/mapper/baddisk</em> with <em>1GB</em> of size.
Starting from sector <em>6050</em>, there are <em>155</em> faulty sectors, where any write and
read operation should cause I/O errors.</p>

<p>I went on and used <em>dd</em> to write to the device, as the first faulty block
should start around <em>3MB</em>, i used the following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>To my surprise, the command succeeded. I assumed some error in my setup and
after re-creating the device mapper target, i tried again. This time with the
following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk
 <span>dd</span>: writing to <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error
 3096576 bytes <span>(</span>3.1 MB, 3.0 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0238947 s, 130 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Nice, the device behaves as expected! While taking notes in another terminal
and switching back and forth workspaces, i issued the following command again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>What? It succeeded writing <em>4.1MB</em> of data to a faulty segment of the disk
which should clearly fail! This was strange, but still, after many attempts
with this command writing to the complete device until it got end of space, no
I/O errors were reported by <em>dd</em>.</p>

<p>Looking at the <em>dmesg</em> output, the kernel correctly reported errors with the
underlying device:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> Buffer I/O error on dev dm-3, logical block 757, lost async page write
 <span>[</span>..]</code></pre></figure>

<p>And running <em>badblocks</em> on the device also correctly reported them.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> does dd not report this error?</p>

<p>The difference between the commands is the used block size, so i assumed some
caching beeing the cause for this situation, or maybe dd opening the file with
different flags like O_DIRECT or O_SYNC if smaller block sizes are used?</p>

<p>I straced the <em>dd</em> command and the openat/write and close functions behaved
exacly the same, this time i used a <em>5MB</em> block size for simpler debugging:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> openat<span>(</span>AT_FDCWD, <span>"/dev/mapper/baddisk"</span>, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 3
 write<span>(</span>1, <span>"</span><span>\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0</span><span>"</span>..., 5242880<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 5242880
 close<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>                                <span>=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>The strace output shows that the succeeding command opens the file without any
notable difference to the command writing with 512 bytes block size.  The write
and close functions return with no error whatsoever. <em>dd</em> simply does not
notice the data loss while writing to the storage!</p>

<p>Making <em>dd</em> use the <em>O_DIRECT</em> flag during file open, or the <em>O_SYNC</em> option
catches the error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>5M <span>oflag</span><span>=</span>direct
 <span>dd</span>: error writing <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the reason for this? I assume dd, with its standard block size of 512
bytes does not the hit the linux kernels buffered I/O. And with bigger block
sizes, the I/O becomes buffered, async, and as it stands, dd as user space
application does not validate the write operation (using fsync) to notice
errors during buffered I/O operations by default.</p>

<p>This leads us to my next finding: “the linux fsync() gate” that dates back to
2018, starting with the following question on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42434872/writing-programs-to-cope-with-i-o-errors-causing-lost-writes-on-linux">Writing programs to cope with I/O errors causing lost writes on Linux
</a></p>

<p>And resulting LWN articles:</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/">Improved block-layer error handling</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">PostgreSQL’s fsync() surprise</a></p>

<p>which provide great insight into the linux kernels error handling and how these
errors are upstreamed to user space applications while writing data to faulty
devices.</p>

<p>Long story short: If one uses <em>dd</em> with a bigger block size <em>(&gt;= 4096)</em>, be
sure to use either the <em>oflag=direct</em> or <em>conv=fsync</em> option to have proper
error reporting while writing data to a device. I would prefer <em>conv=fsync</em>, dd
will then <em>fsync()</em> the file handle once and report the error, without having
the performance impact which <em>oflag=direct</em> has.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1500 <span>conv</span><span>=</span>fsync
<span>dd</span>: fsync failed <span>for</span> <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

			<p>With Typescript 4.1, it’s now possible to use variadic tuple types to construct large types with what appears to be runtime code. The general idea is that we will utilize a chaining pattern, where each operation on the chain returns an expanded version of the chain’s type.</p>
<p>To motivate the example, let us consider a <code>Set</code> class. Our <code>Set</code> is a chaining class, where you may insert, remove, and check for the existence of numbers. To end the chain, you call <code>.value()</code> which returns an array of numbers.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how you might use <code>Set</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> <span>set</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set()
  .insert(<span>2</span>)
  .insert(<span>4</span>)
  .insert(<span>8</span>)

<span>const</span> hasTwo <span>=</span> <span>set</span>.has(<span>2</span>) <span>// true
</span><span></span>
<span>const</span> value <span>=</span> <span>set</span>.remove(<span>2</span>).value() <span>// [4, 8]
</span></code></pre></div><blockquote>

<p>It would be interesting to have a version of <code>Set</code> which can infer that the final <code>value</code> type is the tuple type <code>[4, 8]</code>. This is what we will attempt to do.</p>
<h2 id="baldis-basics">Baldi’s Basics</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with a specification of the <code>Set</code> type which obeys our chaining constraints, such that the <code>insert</code> and <code>remove</code> method returns an instance of <code>Set</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set;
  insert(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set;
  remove(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set;
  has(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;
  value()<span>:</span> <span>number</span>[]
};
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>new (): T</code> syntax specifies a constructor, and allows the <code>new</code> keyword to be used, which in this case is an ergonomic choice.</p>
<p>The next improvement we will make is to add a tuple type parameter to <code>Set</code>, which extends an array of numbers. We will additionally make the default value of that type parameter the empty array. This type parameter represents the current contents of <code>Set</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  insert(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  remove(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  has(x: <span>number</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;
  value()<span>:</span> Elements
};
</code></pre></div><p>In preparation, let us next specify that each member function which takes in a number, additionally takes in an inferred type based on the value which it is passed. Each of these types represent the specific value which was passed in.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;
  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;
  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><h2 id="tuple-insertion">Tuple Insertion</h2>
<p>In the following example, we can see how to represent the addition of a new element into an existing tuple type. This uses a recently developed tuple destructuring syntax. We could also prepend elements by switching the positions of <code>Ex1_Original</code> and <code>Ex1_NewElement</code> on the last line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>type</span> Ex1_Original <span>=</span> [<span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>8</span>];
<span>type</span> Ex1_NewElement <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
<span>type</span> Ex1_ResultantArray <span>=</span> [...Ex1_Original, Ex1_NewElement]; <span>// [2, 4, 8, 10]
</span></code></pre></div><p>We can use the above simple example to finish our <code>insert</code> method type, by specifying that <code>insert</code> returns an instance of <code>Set</code> with the type of our specific value appended to the current tuple type. We will additionally introduce some whitespace to reduce visual noise.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Elements, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, we may use the <code>insert</code> and <code>value()</code> methods and expect they will infer the transient types automatically. This general approach for continually building up types in a “runtime-fashion” is very useful for writing easy-to-use and type-safe libraries.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Ex2_Array <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).insert(<span>4</span>).value(); <span>// [2, 4]
</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="tuple-removal">Tuple Removal</h2>
<p>As of yet, there is no built-in operation for tuple removal. However, it can be implemented using a recursive loop on the type level, the mechanics of which would detract from this article. Of note - at the time of writing, <code>ts-toolbelt</code> uses a less modern variant than the following, and will not work. I may attempt to explain tuple type loops in another article.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>type</span> Filter&lt;<span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>unknown</span><span>[],</span> <span>N</span>&gt; <span>=</span> T <span>extends</span> []
  <span>?</span> []
  <span>:</span> T <span>extends</span> [<span>infer</span> H, ...<span>infer</span> R]
  <span>?</span> H <span>extends</span> N
    <span>?</span> Filter&lt;<span>R</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>&gt;
    <span>:</span> [H, ...Filter&lt;<span>R</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>&gt;]
  <span>:</span> T;

<span>type</span> Ex3_Original <span>=</span> [<span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>8</span>];
<span>type</span> Ex3_ResultantArray <span>=</span> Filter&lt;<span>Ex3_Original</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span>&gt;; <span>// [4, 8]
</span></code></pre></div><p>We can deputize this ability to empower our <code>remove</code> method to remove the corresponding element types from our tuple type.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Elements, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Filter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;<span>&gt;</span>;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, we are able to insert, remove, and get the array value of the numbers we place into our <code>Set</code> object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Ex4 <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).insert(<span>4</span>).remove(<span>2</span>).value(); <span>// [4]
</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="tuple-insertion-2---duplicate-edge-case">Tuple Insertion #2 - Duplicate Edge Case</h2>
<p>Readers following along very closely may have noticed an issue with our <code>insert</code> method type - namely, that multiple insertions of the same value will emplace duplicates on the type level. Since <code>Set</code> is a set, this is not wanted.</p>
<p>Luckily, with our <code>Filter</code> utility type available, we can ensure no duplicates exist by first filtering out that value type.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Filter&lt;<span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Filter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;<span>&gt;</span>;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(x: <span>SpecificValue</span>)<span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we could have just as well determined whether or not the value was already present, and decided whether or not to insert it. This underlines the isomorphism between the value-level and the type-level - specifically that in a lot of cases, any given operation you could think of has both a value-level component and a type-level component, including array operations, arithmetic, graph operations, etc.</p>
<p>As well, any given type specification will have multiple possible representations, with differing efficiency, albeit with respect to compilation time and memory in lieu of runtime cost.</p>
<h2 id="tuple-existence-checks">Tuple Existence Checks</h2>
<p>For existence check, we need another, similar type-level recursive tuple loop. With some meditation, you may be able to notice the similar structure between <code>Exists</code> and <code>Filter</code> - they operate on the same principle.</p>
<p>By design, we choose to say that in the case of a generic type <code>number[]</code>, any given number may or may not exist - which we represent via returning <code>boolean</code> rather than explicitly true or false.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>type</span> Exists&lt;<span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>unknown</span><span>[],</span> <span>N</span>&gt; <span>=</span> T <span>extends</span> []
  <span>?</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>:</span> T <span>extends</span> [<span>infer</span> H, ...<span>infer</span> R]
  <span>?</span> H <span>extends</span> N
    <span>?</span> <span>true</span>
    <span>:</span> Exists&lt;<span>R</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>&gt;
  <span>:</span> <span>boolean</span>;

<span>type</span> Ex5_1 <span>=</span> [<span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>8</span>];
<span>type</span> Ex5_1_HasFour <span>=</span> Exists&lt;<span>Ex5_1</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>&gt;; <span>// true
</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> Ex5_2 <span>=</span> <span>number</span>[];
<span>type</span> Ex5_2_HasFour <span>=</span> Exists&lt;<span>Ex5_1</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>&gt;; <span>// boolean
</span></code></pre></div><p>We now have enough code to finish our type specification of <code>Set</code>, complete with a type-safe existence check.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> <span>type</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {
  <span>new</span> ()<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Elements</span>&gt;;

  insert&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>[...Filter&lt;<span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;, SpecificValue]<span>&gt;</span>;

  remove&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Set&lt;<span>Filter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;<span>&gt;</span>;

  has&lt;<span>SpecificValue</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span>&gt;(
    x: <span>SpecificValue</span>
  )<span>:</span> Exists&lt;<span>Elements</span><span>,</span> <span>SpecificValue</span>&gt;;

  value()<span>:</span> Elements;
};
</code></pre></div><p>And we can finish the section with a few examples of existence checking. Even if we insert an element, remove it, and then check, we still get the correct result. In general, this will work until the compiler no longer has patience, which is an internal implementation detail. In that case, the compiler will claim that our <code>Set</code> contains <code>number[]</code>. Though for reasonable examples, our <code>Set</code> type checking works as we expect:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Ex5_1 <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).insert(<span>4</span>).insert(<span>8</span>).has(<span>4</span>); <span>// true
</span><span></span><span>const</span> Ex5_2 <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Set().insert(<span>2</span>).remove(<span>2</span>).has(<span>2</span>); <span>// false
</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="value-level">Value-Level</h2>
<p>A value-level implementation of <code>Set</code> is provided below, mostly to demonstrate the separation between value-level implementation and type-level specification, which is sometimes wise with more involved types.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>const</span> Set <span>=</span> (<span>class</span> {
  <span>private</span> <span>set</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span>[] <span>=</span> [];

  <span>public</span> insert(x: <span>number</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>set</span> <span>=</span> [...<span>this</span>.<span>set</span>.filter((y) <span>=&gt;</span> y <span>!==</span> x), x];
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span>;
  }

  <span>public</span> remove(x: <span>number</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>set</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.<span>set</span>.filter((y) <span>=&gt;</span> y <span>!==</span> x);
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span>;
  }

  <span>public</span> has(x: <span>number</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>set</span>.includes(x);
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span>;
  }

  <span>public</span> value() {
    <span>return</span> [...<span>this</span>.<span>set</span>];
  }
} <span>as</span> <span>unknown</span>) <span>as</span> Set;
</code></pre></div><p>The downside is that we now are not doing any compile-checks against the implementation of <code>Set</code> - namely, we are not checking that <code>Set</code> actually does what the types says it will do. The issue with attempting that is that while that approach is possible, it would require every sub-function e.g. <code>includes</code>, etc. to also be just as type-safe. Essentially, for libraries in Typescript it’s my opinion that it’s safer and more readable to keep the type specification and the value-level separate. Application-side code should endeavor to do the opposite however.</p>
<p>It may be possible to automatically extract a simplified type of <code>Set</code> which we can validate our runtime implementation against, but it would be hard.</p>
<p>Final note: For pedagogic reasons, I have glossed over some nuance with respect to <code>new ()</code> - really, a wrapper type is needed to hide the member functions until the class is actually constructed, which is demonstrated on the TS Playground version of the code.</p>

<p>Dynamic, functional programming languages like Clojure are sometimes considered “slower” than their statically-typed and/or OO counterparts, due to facilities like dynamic function dispatch and immutable-orientation, etc. But this comparison is too general. </p>



<p>Clojure is <em>readily</em> optimizable in cases where utmost performance is key. Clojure embraces the “Get it working, then make it fast” approach to building up a software system—even large-scale systems with high performance demands<a href="#footnotes" data-type="internal" data-id="#footnotes">¹</a>.</p>



<p>This post is about micro-optimizing Clojure code: how can we improve our Clojure code performance on the JVM when we need it the most, when hot code paths and tight loops prevail—for example, in large-scale data processing systems.</p>



<p>General JVM performance, benchmarking, and tuning is a broad and deep skillset and there are many more considerations beyond Clojure. The focus here is Clojure-specific.</p>

<p>Before we get to our specific list of Clojure optimizations, we should emphasize that running your own benchmark and profiling experiments is essential to producing specific top-level performance outcomes for your own code and domain.</p>



<p>You could follow all of the advice in this post, shower your code with type hints, remove laziness and sequences, etc, etc, and⁠ without a <em>specific</em> performance model for where your costs are coming from and how to measure improvement, it is possible or even likely to see no dip in your processing latencies or reduction in your cloud bill<a href="#footnotes">²</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend the following tools for performing your own analyses; these were all used in developing this post:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">criterium</a> A benchmarking tool that is a Clojure industry-standard at this point; most of the relative benchmarks in this post are generated from the REPL using criterium.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler">clj-async-profiler</a> For minimal quick and dirty Clojure profiling. REPL-enabled.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble">no.disassemble</a> For inspecting Clojure-compiled byte code from the REPL. (If you’re familiar with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javap.html">javap</a>, the output is what you would see from decompiling classes using javap -c on the command-line, except you can see what a compiled Clojure function looks like.)</li><li><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">jmh</a> (Java Microbenchmark Harness) A feature-rich benchmarking toolkit for the JVM. Its usage is heavily Java/annotation-based (so not REPL-friendly) but it has an expressive feature set, making it possible to run more specialized<a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java"> </a>benchmarks such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java">ones</a> that could deadlock (and many others; see <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/">here</a>.) We find it essential in carrying out a comprehensive benchmarking analyses and we’ll demonstrate out how to use it with Clojure a bit later on.</li></ul>



<h2 id="avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</h2>



<p>Clojure’s sequence abstraction and laziness are powerful programming facilities but we must shy away from these tools when memory and compute are in high demand. </p>



<p>Why? Lazy implementations require generating&nbsp;<em>per-element&nbsp;</em>state and this can be substantial overhead when compared to non-lazy alternatives like arrays and vectors whose elements each contribute just their own value’s size to memory.</p>



<p>Accordingly there is computation overhead in laziness due to this per element construction; compare lazy implementations of map and filter to transform values in a vector with a non-lazy (<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">transducer</a>-based) alternative:</p>

<p>into has first-class transducer support; the same over-<em>2x</em> gains follow when using transducers + transduce in favor of laziness + reduce.</p>



<p>Avoid laziness where scale matters.</p>



<h2 id="first-and-last">first and last</h2>



<p>This one is particularly frustrating. We might expect <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first">first</a> and <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/last">last</a> to have special consideration of their provided type. But this is not the case; they are implemented over Clojure’s lazy sequence API without respect of type. Even with a vector, last will obtain the result using a full linear pass over the data. Both first and last <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/seq">seq</a> the input unnecessarily which is additional computation cost.</p>



<p>Of course we have a way out⁠—but the moral of the story is to stay well away from first and last when optimal performance is required. Here’s a full sequence of benchmarks; notice the dramatic relative cost of first and last on vectors. Pick the latencies you like the best:</p>

<p>Edit: Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/peek">peek</a> will answer the last item of a vector optimally.

<h2 id="equiv-equals">equiv and equals</h2>



<p>An occasional need in high-performing applications is a read-heavy, in-memory cache or value registry, commonly with some kind of composite/tuple for its map keys. It turns out that the choice of datatype (for both map and key) are… erm… key here.</p>



<p>Consider the following benchmarks for a simple map lookup using different combinations of map type (Clojure’s PersistentHashMap vs. Java’s HashMap) and composite key type.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>PersistentHashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>167 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>95 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>78 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>116 ns</td></tr><tr><td>HashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>36 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>53 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>33 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>152 ns</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Benchmarks for (get map key) for different map and key types. CacheKey is a basic defrecord type; “a:b” is a simple String with the composite values concatenated, etc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is quite a lot of variation in performance: JDK’s HashMap performs significantly better (except when using a record key—we’ll look at that one later). What accounts for this? </p>



<p>Clojure defines <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/equality">equality</a> (i.e., clojure.core/=) more generically than Java’s .equals and this definition is used by Clojure’s data structures for equality comparison, PersistentHashMap in this case:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>v <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span> v2 <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>=</span> v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 91.347726 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.741904 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Significant performance difference for these composite (vector) keys.</p>



<p>Of course, Clojure’s = is more general than Java .equals, which is a stricter comparison in several cases; here is just one example:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>.</span>equals <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ false<br>
<span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ true</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>So we need to be sure that the keys we use in our map are carefully constructed to always compare correctly with the stronger .equals semantics.</p>



<p>Lastly, using a defrecord (CacheKey) appears to offer the worst performance. Let’s use some lightweight profiling to understand what is going on here, by comparing records vs vectors as keys:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><br>

Map lookup using a vector tuple as the key.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From our profiling, the map equality used by the CacheKey record looks suspicious. We can confirm its performance is much worse than vector equals:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>ka <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span> kb <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals ka kb<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 2.015044 µs</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>ka <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span> kb <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals ka kb<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 11.376671 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>The performance overhead we’ve discussed here is minimal for map lookups of singular values like keywords; we are generally okay to stick to Clojure datatypes for data entities where these key types are idiomatic. Still, using records (defrecord) for data entities can have a significant twofactor impact on key lookups:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : &nbsp;5.638519 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>{</span>:<span>a</span> <span>"a"</span> :<span>b</span> <span>"b"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.495481 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>To make a broader generalization to wrap up this section, the JDK ecosystem at large has battled-hardened collection and data structure offerings for high performance use cases and Clojure’s Java interop (with type hints!) gives us access to any of these that make sense for our code hot spots.</p>



<h2 id="dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</h2>



<p>Another occasional need is for a per-thread state mechanism. Clojure has dynamic vars and binding, but the Clojure implementation of reading a dynamic var is far less optimal than using a ThreadLocal directly:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>^</span>:<span>dynamic</span> <span>*</span>dyna<span>-</span>state<span>*</span> nil<span>)</span><br>
<span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>^</span>ThreadLocal thr<span>-</span>local<span>-</span>state <span>(</span>ThreadLocal<span>.</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p><p>

<span>(</span><span>binding</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span>dyna<span>-</span>state<span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Git is a popular version control software used by a lot of tech companies (Yes, there are still companies using <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">SVN</a>).
If you don’t know Git, here’s a quick <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git">tutorial</a> to get started.</p>

<p>In this post, I will show you the Git commands I use everyday at work. In fact, this is the same material that I teach
new hires when they join my company. Let’s get started.</p>


<p>This is an option of the regular <code>git commit</code> command. Let’s say that you just commited some changes like this</p>
<div><div><pre><code>commit 3b867ef53b9027d3125ecb84437827b5e4d476f1
Author: Bao Chau &lt;chauquocbao0907@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Sun Jan 3 20:55:15 2021 -0800

    add new blog post
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then, you remember that you forget to add another file to the same commit. Maybe you want to add more details to the git commit.
Either way, you want to make some change to <em>the latest git commit</em>. In that case, you can use the command <code>git commit --amend</code>.</p>

<p>After executing that command, you should see a text editor pops up and ask you to update the commit. If you use vi or vim like me, you should see 
something like this on your terminal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>add new blog post               
                                                                                  
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. 
#                                                                              
# Date:      Sun Jan 3 20:55:15 2021 -0800
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can now update the commit message, save it and Git will update your commit with the new message.</p>

<p>If you’d like to add new files in the commit, make sure you <code>git add</code> your files first. If then you don’t want to change your commit
message, you can add the option <code>--no-edit</code> (<code>git commit --amend --no-edit</code>) and Git will update your latest commit with the new files.</p>

<p>Pretty convenient, right? I use this quite often at work.</p>


<p>This is another option of <code>git commit</code> command that I use heavily in my work. Here’s a popular scenario I run into at work:</p>

<p>I created a PR with 10 commits. My teammate reviewed it, gave some feedbacks and I went back and updated my PR. However, most of
the time I will only want to update the code, not the commit itself. As a result, I want a quick way to update the code in my commit
without changing the commit message. <code>Fixup</code> allows me to do that work flawlessly.</p>

<p>So how can you use it? Let’s say you have 4 commits like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>commit 2e8a77a2b45a75576f6eecde9772be7fade10e15 <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; addGitCommandBlogpost<span>)</span>
Author: Bao Chau &lt;chauquocbao0907@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Tue Jan 5 21:46:37 2021 <span>-0800</span>

    commit 4

commit e2b138c242fb61b5e420f5f09b5d9ab02ed33d2e
Author: Bao Chau &lt;chauquocbao0907@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Tue Jan 5 21:46:26 2021 <span>-0800</span>

    commit 3

commit bd502f8eea7b4bc29ec37295da81ded81c0e48c9
Author: Bao Chau &lt;chauquocbao0907@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Tue Jan 5 21:46:14 2021 <span>-0800</span>

    commit 2

commit 716edf4b19ec238236ad59ed8a355cce952c7412
Author: Bao Chau &lt;chauquocbao0907@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Tue Jan 5 21:46:04 2021 <span>-0800</span>

    commit 1
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now let’s say you want to add <code>hello.txt</code> to commit 1 and <code>world.txt</code> to commit 3. 
For commit 1, first you need to run <code>git add hello.txt</code>.</p>

<p>And then you can run <strong><code>git commit --fixup &lt;SHA of the commit you want to fixup&gt;</code></strong>. In this case, it’s <code>716edf4b19ec2</code>.</p>

<p>Note: You don’t need the whole SHA for the fixup. The first 10 characters should be good enough.</p>

<p>So if you do everything’s correctly, here’s what you should see:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bao@bao-linux:~/code/baoqchau.github.io<span>$ </span>git commit <span>--fixup</span> 716edf4b19ec2
<span>[</span>addGitCommandBlogpost f9ff455] fixup! commit 1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After that, you can follow similar steps for commit 3.</p>

<p>So now you have 2 <code>fixup</code> commits, you will want to find a way to “squash” them into the commits you’d like. You can do
 that by interactive rebasing, or <code>git rebase -i</code> command. In this case, the command we use is <code>git rebase -i --autosquash &lt;SHA of commit you want to rebase from&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Quick tips</strong>: For rebasing after fixup, the fastest way I have always done is copying the SHA of the commit you’d like to fixup
 that’s furthest from the top when you do <code>git log</code>, and add a <code>~</code> next to it, i.e go one commit below that.</p>

<p>For our example, we want to fixup commit 1 and commit 3, and since commit 1 is furthest, we will copy its SHA and add a <code>~</code>, or 
  the command we will use is <code>git rebase -i --autosquash 716edf4b19ec2~</code>.</p>

<p>If you do it correctly, you should see this interactive view in your text editor:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  pick 716edf4 commit 1                                                            
  pick f9ff455 fixup! commit 1                                                     
  pick bd502f8 commit 2                                                            
  pick e2b138c commit 3                                                            
  pick f7fcd1d fixup! commit 3   
  pick 2e8a77a commit 4

  <span># Commands:                                                                      </span>
  <span># p, pick = use commit                                                           </span>
  <span># r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message                            </span>
  <span># e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending                                    </span>
  <span># s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit                          </span>
  <span># f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message                </span>
  <span># x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell                       </span>
  <span># d, drop = remove commit                                                        </span>
  <span>#                                                                                </span>
  <span># These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.           </span>
  <span>#                                                                                </span>
  <span># If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.                            </span>
  <span>#                                                                                </span>
  <span># However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.                 </span>
  <span>#                                                                                </span>
  <span># Note that empty commits are commented out</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As you can see, Git know to reorder your commits so that the fixup commit will be below the one that needs to be fixup-ed. If you check it
  and everything’s good, you can save the file and Git will apply the change. This process can save you a lot of time!!</p>

<p>Through this tutorial, I hope it will help you do your work faster. If you’d like more useful tips I learn at work, let me know by sending me an email :)</p>

<p>Depending on how tech-centric your circle is, it seems like everyone wants to become a product manager. And it makes sense. Product managers help shape the direction of a product and are squarely at the intersection of creativity, technical understanding, business, and customers. It’s broad and deep—and you have the opportunity to hone a spectrum of skills. </p>
<p>Here’s how I approached getting a job in product: I applied the same lessons I gleaned from product management books and articles to my search. I understood my target persona, differentiated myself, and iterated as I went to market. Think of yourself as a product and relentlessly dogfood lessons. Put theory to work.</p>
<h2>You = Product</h2>
<p>In a hyperconnected world, it’s easy to lose sight of your own goal. The opinions of others and the biased prescriptive statements masquerading as advice can cloud your own perspective of what matters. In approaching my career, my first order of business was to be clear on what my goals are and the underlying reason for them. I also made sure to maintain an air of tangibility and jot down limiting factors—or what I assume are limiting factors.</p>
<p><strong>My goal (and why):</strong> I wanted to be a product manager at a big tech company so I can learn product management skills in a disciplined way, contribute to products that reach millions of users, and meet some phenomenal individuals. </p>
<p><strong>My hypothesis:</strong> I can get just about any job I want by applying lessons from product management.</p>
<p><strong>My constraints:</strong> I had no MBA or a significant network to start off with.</p>
<h2>Theory + Experimentation + Iteration</h2>
<p>Based on my goal, my hypothesis on accomplishing it, and constraints, I made a plan and executed relentlessly. </p>
<h4><strong>Identified My Target Audience</strong></h4>
<p>I wanted to be a PM at only <em>Company</em> <em>X</em> so I narrowed my target audience—hiring managers—to a very specific set of job titles: Director or Senior Manager of Product Management at <em>Company X</em>. It doesn’t have to be complicated. </p>
<h4><strong>Differentiated Myself.</strong> </h4>
<div><p>A key product management lesson in building or launching products: to succeed in a crowded market, your product must be differentiated. How are you uniquely delivering value or capturing attention? Now, I didn’t set out to check a series of boxes to accomplish this. Rather, I unabashedly entertained my curiosity. I built products, even if I was doing it without a title to my name. I focused on delivering value and understanding what people want. I focused intensely on one subject at a time. I was not shy in reaching out to leaders, peers, or students to learn. </p><p>I wanted to learn how to launch products so I started this quest by studying 14 books. These books gave way for a basic framework and unanswered questions. There was something lacking from these books. I wanted a perspective with a dose of reality. Soon after, I reached out to dozens of product management and marketing leaders on LinkedIn and listened to them. Over a course of 6 to 7 months, on weekends and weekday nights, I compiled my learnings in the form of a book and published it.</p><p>To get social proof and add fuel to this cycle of learning, I asked for reviews from the vice presidents of product management and marketing at Salesforce, Cisco, Automation Anywhere, and many more organizations in technology. They gratefully provided feedback, testimonials, and learnings. </p><p><em>Product Marketing, Simplified</em> went from being an idea in my head to being one of the top books in its category, selling a thousand copies so far. </p><p>By relentlessly pursuing my curiosity in a directed way, I was able to expand my network, learn a tremendous amount, and build credibility by doing something different. </p></div>
<h4>Went to Market</h4>
<p>Rejection hurts. But viewing the search as a logical process—as a marketing funnel—failure and success are simply outputs and not personal criticisms. </p>
<p>To start this process, I sent <em>X</em> cold messages to my target audience to test the waters. I identified my response rate and how many of my cold messages converted to a first phone call. I refined my message and iterated with feedback. While composing the next cold email, I’d remind myself: “Srini, that’s far too long. If you were the one receiving this message, how would you react?” Through iteration, I defined the attributes of an ideal cold email: concise, clear, differentiated, and actionable. Like any good message.</p>
<p>After about <em>XX</em> messages that included links to my resume and <a href="https://srinisekaran.com/books/">book</a>—and several interview rounds—I had a couple of offers with great teams at the largest names in tech.</p>
<h2>First Principles &gt; Conventional Wisdom</h2>
<p>To become a product manager, I didn’t instantly set out to get a certificate or an MBA degree because that’s what conventional wisdom dictates. Instead, I approached this goal with first principles<em>. </em>And in this case, I approached the search with product management principles. I pursued my curiosity, built products, listened, iterated, and differentiated myself. I proved my hypothesis and got a product management job by relentlessly dogfooding product lessons.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- links --><section><article><a href="https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/617189040564928512/how-unix-won"></a><p>Unix has won in every conceivable way. And in true mythic style, it contains the seeds of its own eclipse. This is my <em>subjective</em> historical narrative of how that happened.</p><p>I’m using the name “Unix” to include the entire family of operating systems descended from it, or that have been heavily influenced by it. That includes Linux, SunOS, Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, and many, many others.</p><p>Both major mobile OSs, Android and iOS, have Unix roots. Their billions of users dwarf those using clunky things like laptops and desktops, but even there, Windows is only the non-Unix viable OS. Almost everything running server-side in giant datacenters is Linux.</p><p>How did Unix win?</p><ul><li><p>It was built by programmers, for programmers. If you read the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FP01T4G5I2lk&amp;t=YmZjZTc4NWY5ODgyZTllYzdlOWY0Njk3NmM2NzUzYjgxYjAwMDM3NyxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182433">early papers describing Unix</a>, you will see how the key abstractions (hierarchical filesystems, permissions, processes, interactive shells, pipes) have lasted conceptually unsullied for decades. That could only have happened if it exerted such a force field over geek minds that they propagated it.</p></li><li><p>The majority of it was written not in assembly language, but in C, a higher-level language, hence making it portable. This enabled relatively easy ports to a wide variety of hardware.</p></li><li><p>A freak historical accident. AT&amp;T Labs, where it was developed, was forbidden under its anti-trust settlement from commercializing products unrelated to its core telecom business. Hence, Unix was licensed very cheaply to universities, including UC Berkeley, which subsequently built one of the more influential branches of the Unix family tree—BSD. Apparently, AT&amp;T classified Unix as <a href="https://twitter.com/nuthaven/status/1254897999290892289?s=09">industrial waste</a> for tax purposes when licensing it!</p></li><li><p>Unix spread through academia, and those students spread it through corporations after they graduated. It’s a strategy that has been used by every major tech company, only in this case it was organic.</p></li><li><p>And then came the Internet, and the whole universe of daemons, tools, protocols, and utilities that undergirded it was built natively on Unix. That wasn’t a huge surprise because a lot of the people that built the Net were Unix natives. BSD open-sourced its TCP/IP stack, kicking off its wide adoption outside the military.</p></li><li><p>By the late 90s and early 2000s, Linux started taking over the server-side. It has become the ultimate virtuous cycle in open source. When picking a new kernel one is virtually forced to go with Linux because of the huge community and massive engineering that has gone into solidifying it. That’s probably why Android picked Linux even though it was running on the other end of the hardware spectrum.</p></li></ul><p>So how and why would we move past Unix?</p><ul><li><p>Unix, which got standardized into the POSIX spec, has accreted a tremendous amount of complexity over the decades. The <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.open-std.org%2Fjtc1%2Fsc22%2Fopen%2Fn4217.pdf&amp;t=NmE1ODhmYWJlZGY4ZjM0YjU4Zjk1ZjMyODA3ZWUwM2JhMzUzMDk3YyxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182433">POSIX spec</a> is <em>3000 pages</em> long. Linux now has nearly 400 system calls. What started as a clean, pure, minimal and elegant set of system abstractions has become a complex beast.</p></li><li><p>The very idea of the OS providing general-purpose abstractions with wide applicability is being challenged. When Unix was created, IO was orders of magnitude slower than CPU. There were enough CPU cycles to burn to provide these high-level abstractions, like a complex hierarchical filesystem. <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FSM3PhGGllL0&amp;t=YmE3NDY1ZTczYTc0MzEyNzYwMDExNDkxM2VjNzlhZTI3NWE2N2NhNyxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182433">Now IO can easily saturate CPU</a>. At least on the server side, folks just want to get the fastest performance out of their hardware. That’s leading to the rise of frameworks like <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fspdk.io&amp;t=YzJjZDc1M2YzZTYzZDIzMjhkNDMwNDE3Y2ZiYzJkZTY0ZGEzOWQ3NSxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182433">SPDK</a> and <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdpdk.org&amp;t=ODgyMjU2MzgzZWNkZGU3NDRhNDkyZGIwNzNlY2M5M2M2NGI2ZDczZixXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182433">DPDK</a> that bypass heavy OS abstractions for storage and networking in favor of applications directly accessing the raw hardware, and rolling whatever abstraction they do need on their own.</p></li><li><p>The entire ecosystem in which an OS exists is changing. Application-level experiences are hermetic and make the underlying OS more or less irrelevant. Just look at Android or iOS or ChromeOS. Programming to a virtual machine (like the Java VM) makes programmers much more invested in their PL/runtime than the OS.</p></li><li><p>The above two points raise an interesting question: what does a modern operating system want? Look, for example, at <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffuchsia.dev%2Ffuchsia-src%2Freference%2Fkernel_objects%2Fobjects&amp;t=NDE3ZWQxNWYyMDhkMWVlOTQ5ZGZhZWU0ZGRmNWQ1NjY0ZGY1ZWIzNyxXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182433">Fuchsia</a>, which is going in the direction of a microkernel with capabilities, that pushes most drivers and OS services out to userspace. These are ideas that have been floating in academic OS research for decades, but could never gain real mainstream acceptance because of the high barrier to making a viable real-world OS. This is the effect Rob Pike was talking about in his <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdoc.cat-v.org%2Fbell_labs%2Futah2000%2F&amp;t=YzliYmVkNmQ1OTg2ZWYzZGQ2YmUxZmY0YmQzNzQyYjkwYTZhMTIzNixXTGp0MVRIVg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz7WLZgUZivf9ZQQuRafZA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vivekhaldar.com%2Fpost%2F617189040564928512%2Fhow-unix-won&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1610182433">“Systems Research is Irrelevant”</a> talk. But the prior two trends are finally dislodging the iron grip of Unix, and OSs are becoming interesting again!</p></li></ul></article> <!-- /post -->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I made a goal for myself in January 2020 to stop using Google products by the end of the year. That might sound like way too generous a timeline, but Google owned pretty much all of my data at that point, so it was a fairly large project. Plus I'm a slow and steady kind of person. I know if I give myself a generous enough timeline I can accomplish even things that seem too hard for me at first.</p>
<h2>First, Why</h2>
<p>Since I got into programming about 5 years ago, I kept hearing all these bad things about Google and how horrible of a company it is from other tech people. It always seemed a bit exaggerated to me, but the evidence has been piling up over the years. Learning about <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533">their involvement</a> with the US military's <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Project%20Maven%20DSD%20Memo%2020170425.pdf">Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (Project Maven)</a> was the last straw for me <sup id="footnote-1"><a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/what-i-use-now-instead-of-google/#footnote-1-text">1</a></sup>, but even before I learned about that I was pretty uncomfortable with a lot of what I heard. In Google's defence they eventually did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210101083904/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html">pull out of the project</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231204850/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html">massive backlash by thousands of employees</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I'm pretty convinced now that their continued existence is a catastrophe not only for public safety, but also for <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/3/21030688/google-amazon-ai-oil-gas">the environment</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html">gender equity</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/9739039/Googles-tax-avoidance-is-called-capitalism-says-chairman-Eric-Schmidt.html">the economy</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgexe8/google-fired-an-engineer-who-wrote-code-telling-googlers-they-had-a-right-to-organize">fair labour practices</a>, <a href="https://www.stallman.org/google.html#surveillance">privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00954-0">journalism</a>, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/epstein-testimony">democracy</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17168256/google-racism-algorithms-technology">race relations</a>, and the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/big-tech-out-of-control-capitalism-and-the-end-of-civilization/">project of civilization itself</a>. But anyway, the point of this post isn't to motivate you to also quit Google. I'll tell you how I really feel some other time.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is about the tools and services I replaced all the Google things with. I did mostly accomplish my goal, with a few caveats which I describe in the relevant sections.</p>
<h2>Replacements</h2>
<p>Here's the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>GMail → <a href="https://protonmail.com/signup">ProtonMail</a></li>
<li>Chrome → <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer edition</a></li>
<li>Google search → <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
<li>Google Drive → <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></li>
<li>Google DNS → <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">Cloudflare DNS</a></li>
<li>Maps → Apple maps</li>
<li>YouTube → Netflix, <a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED talks</a>, conference archives, and still a little YouTube (anonymously in a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox container</a>)</li>
<li>Google Analytics → <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></li>
<li>Everything else (calendar, reminders, photos, docs, video chat, news feeds) → <a href="https://nextcloud.com/signup/">Nextcloud</a>, running <a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">on my own instance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the long version:</p>
<h3>GMail → <a href="https://protonmail.com/signup">ProtonMail</a></h3>
<p>ProtonMail has free accounts, but I pay for the lowest level that allows use of a custom domain with it (€48/year) so I don't have to change my email address ever again if I want to switch providers. It was quite a pain to change my email address all over the place, but I started in May and just did it slowly over time. I highly recommend decoupling your email address from your email provider if you're considering switching. First of all an email from a custom domain seems more, not less, serious than a gmail address to most people. But the main reason is just so you don't have to change your email address ever again if (when) you want to switch to some newer, better email provider.</p>
<p>I set up forwarding from my old GMail account to my new email address then filtered my mail for anything sent to the old address. If it was someone or some place I wanted to continue hearing from, I updated my email address with them. If not I unsubscribed. This turned out to be a wonderful opportunity to purge my newsletter and other email subscriptions. Also I'm happy to report most companies are now (finally) respecting unsubscribe requests. Two (looking at you Geektastic and Rakuten) continued to spam me after I requested they stop, so now I filter out all their mail as spam.</p>
<h3>Chrome → Firefox developer edition</h3>
<p>I primarily use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer edition</a> now for my browser, including for work. The developer tools are just as good as Chrome's for the kind of work I do.</p>
<p>There are some web apps that literally or effectively only work in Chrome, which ironically perfectly illustrates the impetus for this whole undertaking. For those I use this <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium#downloads">ungoogled Chromium</a> browser, installed via homebrew.</p>
<p>I still have Chrome installed on my computer because I need it for some work things. We use chromedriver for some integration tests and it wasn't trivially easy to trick it into using my Chromium installation instead of looking for Chrome. Replacing chromedriver is a headache, and also not my call to make at work. But it's also not really the point for me. If Google was reduced to a browser that developers can easily launch and control programmatically, I'd be satisfied. I don't use it for anything other than running automated tests at work now.</p>
<h3>Google search → <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></h3>
<p>I mostly love DuckDuckGo, but there are certain categories of searches where Google returns better results. DuckDuckGo doesn't seem to return many results from forums (like stack overflow or other stack exchange sites), which is where there the answers to a lot of my questions are, unfortunately. So I still use Google Search sometimes, but I do it in a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox container</a> without being logged in to a Google account, which at least helps to avoid some of Google's incessant stalking.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo does seem to return better results when the answer is an image, video, or regular web page, which is cool, and I suspect means it would be a perfectly fine replacement for most people. For example this blog is easier to find via DuckDuckGo than Google, which is impressive because I share a name with a small-time TV celebrity who typically dominates search results. We even look sort of similar, it's wild.</p>
<h3>Google Drive → <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></h3>
<p>I use Sync to make my most used files available anywhere, and I've started moving a huge backlog of documents and notes I don't need to access often but don't want to throw away to Backblaze for longer term storage, just because it's cheaper. So far I just use their web UI to upload things in bulk and browse my files, but I'm looking into ways to do that more efficiently. I really need to de-clutter my digital life. I'm a major hoarder when it comes to digital files. I have scarcely deleted a document in the last 10 years, it's getting a bit ridiculous. But that's a goal for another year 🙂. For now I'm just putting all those files I don't really need to access but don't want to throw away in Backblaze to deal with later.</p>
<p>Between Sync and Backblaze I got 15GB of free storage, which is plenty for now, though as I move more and more or my scattered files over I'll have to start paying. Backblaze offers some of the cheapest object storage there is, at least.</p>
<h3>DNS → Cloudflare DNS</h3>
<p>I used to use Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), now I use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">Cloudflare's</a> (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1).</p>
<h3>Maps, YouTube</h3>
<p>These ones are harder to replace. I use Apple maps now most of the time, but I still use Waze (which was acquired by Google) for directions sometimes if I'm driving somewhere. For media I mostly watch Netflix, but I also watch a lot of <a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED talks</a>. I used to also watch conference videos on YouTube. Now I check conference websites for those, and a lot of them have the recordings, although they're often hosted on YouTube anyway. And I also do still use YouTube sometimes, mostly for home workout videos, but also anonymously in an isolated container.</p>
<h3>Analytics → <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></h3>
<p>It's been a while since I used Google Analytics, but I wanted to set up a basic hit counter for this blog and found Fathom. They provide simple privacy-focused analytics that work well enough for me. One really useful feature they have that I consider necessary now is being able to log analytics with a custom domain. Without this, visitors using ad-blockers don't get counted, which most estimates figure is now something like 40% of people, and probably more among tech-type people, like the ones most likely to find this blog.</p>
<p>I tried Cloudflare's new server-side analytics for a month, but the data didn't make as much sense (it showed the overwhelming number of visits to my homepage, even though the other analytics I had set up showed them going to one post that did well on Hacker News, which makes way more sense). Anyway, the numbers didn't seem to add up. I guess to be fair I <a href="https://twitter.com/kiraemclean/status/1340530206516387840">don't quite understand</a> how Fathom's numbers add up yet either, but their support has been helpful checking it out with me to try to help me reach some interpretation that makes sense. Fathom's dashboard is really simple, at least, which I like because it's easy to understand.</p>
<h3>Calendar, reminders, photos, docs, video chat, news feeds → <a href="https://nextcloud.com/signup/">Nextcloud</a></h3>
<p>For everything else I use Nextcloud now. I <a href="https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">run my own instance</a> of it, but there are lots of providers where you can just sign up for a simple account like anything else if you're not an insufferable nerd who enjoys maintaining servers, like me.</p>
<p>This is where I have another caveat to mention. I haven't migrated all of my photos off of Google Photos yet because I have about 50,000 of them and it's just a really slow process. I estimated it would take me something like 70 hours to move them all manually, so I'm looking into better ways to do it. I'm confident I can find or maybe build something easier than manually downloading and uploading 50k files in less than 70 hours.</p>
<p>Nextcloud does the job of automatically syncing photos from my phone, though, which is all I needed to be able to delete Google Photos from my devices. I'm not sure I'll actually stick with Nextcloud for photos in the long run. The gallery is a bit lacking. It looks like <a href="https://piwigo.org/get-piwigo">Piwigo</a> might be a good alternative. Either way, I'm actually storing my photos in Backblaze, so I'll continue looking around for a different client for a bucket full of photos next year as I work on slowly culling my photos collection and migrating it to a new home.</p>
<h2>Total Cost</h2>
<p>I feel like I've won a lot by doing all this. I own my data now, so Google can't <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">arbitrarily take it away from me</a>, which gives me peace of mind. I'm no longer part of their ad ecosystem, being tracked all around the internet and having my attention sold to the highest bidder. And I also feel good about "voting with my feet", so to speak. The fewer people use Google's free products, the lower their ability to sustain their unethical business model based on selling mass surveillance data.</p>
<p>But I also lost some. Specifically a few …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="http://www.ajasinger.com/"><i><span>Aja Singer</span></i></a><i><span> is the former founding Creative Director at </span></i><a href="https://www.ofmercer.com/"><i><span>Of Mercer</span></i></a><i><span>, where she </span></i><i><span>helped grow the brand from its initial concept into a multi-million dollar company. Prior to that, she </span></i><i><span>was a cofounder of womenswear brand Alex &amp; Eli, responsible for brand strategy and visual identity. She currently runs a branding-focused newsletter, </span></i><a href="https://ajasinger.substack.com/people/6528929-aja-singer"><i><span>For the Love</span></i></a><i><span>, and helps companies with creative and brand strategy. To chat with Aja about your branding needs, </span></i><a href="https://calendly.com/ajasinger/30min"><i><span>book time with her here</span></i></a><i><span>.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p><b>You’ve been the creative force behind two early-stage womenswear brands - what did you get right and wrong with each?</b></p>
<p><span>With my first brand, Alex &amp; Eli, I really pushed myself from a creative and business perspective -- trying out new things and experimenting to see what worked and what didn’t. I’ve tried to carry that attitude through to all of my startups. The mistake I made was listening to advice from too many people.</span><span> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Just because someone has extensive industry experience does not mean they know what’s right for your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>With Of Mercer, I really prioritized getting to know our customers and having an ongoing dialogue with them through emails, surveys, phone calls, and even in-person consultations. This gave me huge insights into their lifestyles so I could better serve their needs. I’d recommend this to every founder, even before they have a product to sell.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What does a good startup branding plan look like?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Branding encompasses so much more than just a font or color; it’s the soul of a brand. First, you need to understand what the brand stands for, it’s value proposition, who it’s serving, and how you want your customers to feel when interacting with it. The visuals and messaging are a reflection of those ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get started, I recommend going through a few branding exercises with the whole team. A brand expert can take you through them, but if you’re looking to nail down your brand before you’re able to partner with one, it’s ok to work through them on your own. Start by defining your perception of your brand, your customer, and what your brand stands for.&nbsp; A great way to do this is to give everyone post-it notes (which you can also do virtually with a tool like Figma) and have them write down words they associate with each category. This allows you to quickly see where thinking is aligned and where you need more clarification. By narrowing these words down to three per category, as a group, you’ll have a good initial understanding of your brand and customer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I work with clients, I’ll walk them through this series of exercises. Once the core identity of the brand is defined, I take a similarly collaborative approach to developing the visuals. We’ll discuss what colors, fonts, and aesthetics team members are drawn to, other brands they like, and brands they don’t, and talk through a number of other visual cues until we’ve all agreed what form the brand should take. I’ll then create a few options to discuss, experiment with (to make sure they fulfil all the needs of that particular brand), and fine-tune, until we’ve defined the visual identity.</span></p>

<p><b>When should startups decide on their branding?</b></p>
<p><span>All the branding elements should be fleshed out very early in a startup’s lifecycle -- a thorough understanding of them will inform every aspect of your business. As for the brand’s visual identity and voice, having this clearly defined and articulated shows potential customers what you offer and what you stand for, which is especially beneficial for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. As a DTC startup, branding is the only way to convey your message and value proposition to customers, so it’s crucial to have that fully realized from launch.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What should go into that decision process?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>I usually start with the series of exercises mentioned above. From there, it’s an ongoing dialogue and refinement process, getting to the core of what a brand looks and sounds like based on those defined core tenets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>For an early-stage startup, when things are changing quickly, it’s best to revisit your brand identity (especially the voice and messaging) every six months or so to make sure it’s aligned with your business goals and trajectory. As for an entire re-brand, you should consider it when hitting other milestones, such as a high-impact sales target, or a new round of funding. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>This generally means your business has had meaningful growth, and your brand identity should evolve along with it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What tools do you use with or recommend for your clients?</b></p>
<p><span>If you’re just starting out, a shared Pinterest board is honestly a great tool for collecting inspiration. Once you’ve honed in on a few themes, you can collect them in </span><a href="https://www.figma.com/"><span>Figma</span></a><span> (which is fantastic because it’s collaborative) to further define the vision. And if you’re looking to translate your ideas into a logo, Upwork has some cost-effective graphic designers. However, if you aren’t working with a branding expert yet, make sure you’ve clearly defined your brand so that any freelancer you work with thoroughly understands your brand’s identity.</span></p>

<p><b>Has your creative process changed now that meetings are mostly remote?</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My workflow has not changed that much (although I do miss in-person meetings). What </span><i><span>has</span></i><span> changed is that I used to gather inspiration from all the cultural activities available in NY, so I spend a lot more time exploring online now. I miss the serendipity of wandering around New York -- seeing new things and meeting new people with new ideas, but there is still so much available online. Social media is a fantastic resource (I check both Instagram and Twitter regularly), and I subscribe to a number of mailing lists and newsletters for the purpose of discovery. I love </span><a href="https://www.sightunseen.com/subscribe/"><span>Sight Unseen</span></a><span> (for all things design), </span><a href="https://thingtesting.com/"><span>Thingtesting</span></a><span> (for new brands), </span><a href="https://www.typewolf.com/"><span>Typewolf</span></a><span> (for font inspiration), to name a few.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What inspired you to start </b><a href="https://ajasinger.substack.com/people/6528929-aja-singer"><b>your newsletter</b></a><b> and how did you get your first subscribers?</b></p>
<p><span>Truthfully, I wanted to get some practice writing regularly! Also, during my time as a founder and while in the e-commerce space, I had thought a lot about startups, branding, and consumer trends but hadn’t had the opportunity to share that knowledge. A newsletter seemed like a great way to do that. The first few issues went out to around 100 subscribers. I told everyone I knew that I was starting a newsletter and it just grew organically from there, with people sharing with friends and on social media. Writing the articles is definitely a lot of work, but I really enjoy diving into topics that I’ve either thought a lot about, or am curious about. Knowing that founders and marketing and brand professionals find it helpful makes it all the more rewarding.</span></p>

<p><b>Which companies do you think are getting branding and messaging right?</b></p>
<p><span>Apple and Nike are incredible examples of brands that have a clear, concise brand vision that’s consistent, yet effectively adapted to every brand touchpoint. As for startups, I think </span><a href="https://patternbrands.com/"><span>Pattern Brands</span></a><span> has done a fantastic job at taking a belief system (enjoying daily life) and building a family of brands around it. And I love </span><a href="https://starface.world/"><span>Starface’s</span></a><span> brand and incorporation of their mascot, Big Yellow -- it’s bringing a fun, welcoming and judgment-free attitude to the skincare space.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>What have you been reading lately?</b></p>
<p><span>I read the New York Times and New York Magazine religiously, and I just started reading two books — </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536299"><span>The Vanishing Half</span></a><span> by Brit Bennett and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299"><span>Atomic Habits</span></a><span> by James Clear.</span></p>

<p><b>What’s a great piece of advice you've received?</b></p>
<p><span>Don’t overthink it. (Although I usually still do!)</span></p>

<p><b>How do you unwind these days?</b></p>
<p><span>Yoga (especially </span><a href="https://www.skyting.com/"><span>Sky Ting</span></a><span>!), going for walks with my husband, and reading. Hopefully I’ll be adding travel back to that list sometime in the future!</span></p>

<p>The goal for this project is to design, 3D-print and assemble the enclosures for several small desktop computers. This series was created during the covid19 pandemic, to get familiar with modern parametric 3D design tools, the limits of 3D printing and fabrication. </p>



<p>A screen size is chosen first, together with the desired components, and then an enclosure is designed around all the constrains (including FDM 3D printing limitations). </p>



<p>All of these have been designed in Autodesk Fusion360 and printed at home on an inexpensive Creality Ender 3.</p>







<h2>4:3 10″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around a 10″ 1024 x 768 IPS LCD. Raspberry PI 4, Ducky One SF Keyboard, black PLA.</p>















<h2>16:9 5″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around a 5″ 800 x 480 LCD. Raspberry Pi 3, Official Raspberry Pi keyboard, black PLA. </p>















<h2>16:9 5″ LCD Terminal v2</h2>



<p>Revised for a more modern look and a smaller footprint. It runs a Raspberry Pi 4, printed on orange PLA. Wireless USB keyboard from ali-express.</p>















<h2>UltraWide 8.8″ LCD Terminal</h2>



<p>Designed around an ultrawide 8.8″ 1920 x 480 LCD, with a rather exotic 4:1 aspect ratio. As this exceeds my 3D printer bed size, I had to figure out a way to split the design in two parts, and how to assemble them effectively. This one is powered by an Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB, allowing it to run OpenGL natively. Ducky One2 SF keyboard. Printed on “copper” PLA.</p>















<h2>Minimal 4:3 8″ Terminal</h2>



<p>1024 x 768 8″ IPS LCD. Designed with the goal of the smallest possible footprint, leaving components out in plain sight. Raspberry pi 4, official Raspberry Pi Keyboard. Printed on neon yellow transparent PLA.</p>















<h2>Other Concepts</h2>



<p>Some rejects I produced along the way…</p>







<p>Retro TV</p>







<p> Macintosh Classic inspired design</p>

So using Gradle means you learn both Maven and Gradle.</p><p>Learning Gradle also means that you have to understand Groovy at some level, to understand how your build script is being composed. But Gradle adds it own DSL to the mix making it impossible to decipher what Groovy language constructs are being used for a particular line in a Gradle script. &nbsp;For example, one can't just define a global variable and use it in the script. Instead it has to be in an <code>ext</code> block.</p><h3 id="we-don-t-need-the-advanced-features">We don't need the advanced features</h3><p>Astradot's Java projects are small microservices. All we need from a build tool is to download dependencies, compile, jar and run a few basic tests. All the advanced, mindbending, quantum-entangling caching features that Gradle has are simply not needed.</p><p>Maven is old and robust. All editors understand it. Intellij's support for it is flawless. The XML while verbose is easily understood.</p><h3 id="there-is-an-exception-though-">There is an exception though...</h3><p>Wait, there actually <em>is</em> a place we use Gradle. That is for our Java Tracing Agent. The requirements for putting together the agent are not like your typical Java jar. Neither Maven nor Gradle could build it out of the box. Our initial thinking was to write a custom build tool for it. However, this is where we found that Gradle absolutely shines. Doing a completely custom build, where you are taking full advantage of the dynamism of having groovy as a full-fledged programming language as opposed to just a declaration format made Gradle the perfect tool for the job.</p><h3 id="that-said">That said</h3><p>For everything else, we saw no reason to choose Gradle over Maven. We do miss those single-line dependency declarations though.</p>

                        <p>I think of them often, don't you? They were much like us, I think. More of them, though, when you add up the decades, the centuries, the eons, all the way back to the <a href="https://poets.org/poem/evangeline-tale-acadie">primeval</a> "days of yore" when strange beasts roamed the earth — our ancestors among them, strange beasts themselves. Much like us, strange beasts that we are even today. Still staring up at our reflections in the sky.</p><p>Some things never change; there is a Spirit that moves through the generations, and is present in you even now. Especially now, because now is when <em>you and I</em> are alive, right this very minute. It's exciting, isn't it? Life begets life, a perpetual chorus of souls arisen from genes. This is not my own paean to reproduction — it is the many mothers and fathers singing through me, loving their children, overjoyed by our miraculous emergence and persistence.</p><p>We ought to romanticize the past, and the people who made it. <em>Ought</em> is superfluous, though — it's not like we can resist the urge. "<a href="https://poets.org/poem/ode-grecian-urn">Heard melodies are sweet</a>, but those unheard / Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on." A serenade acknowledges passion, and pathos, rather than instilling them.</p><p>The people of the past were <em>much like us</em> and of course that's not always a compliment. We do <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/brutality-books/">terrible things</a> to each other. We hurt and we flail and we fail. So did they.</p><p>We must forgive them, I think. Nobody chooses who they are, even the worst sadists. Were you able to opt for unerring virtue instead of expressing your flaws? Could you have done that? They weren't equipped either, however astoundingly depraved those flaws. It is hubris to forgive yourself without forgiving others, a mockery of absolution. (Yes, I ripped that concept from the scripture.) Evil is evil, but there is no virtue in mercy meted only to the deserving. It's like congratulating yourself for being nice to someone you adore.</p><p>The people of the past are still with us in exactly the way that your great-great-grandmother and great-great-grandfather are with you. Their bodies long since rearranged back into the Everything of which each of us is a partitioned element —&nbsp;yet transmitted beyond their own lifespans, through you. To hate previous generations is to hate yourself, and you're too beautiful for that. Don't repudiate the starlight.</p><hr><p>Might fuck around and email you more often this year. (<em>Might</em>, no promises!) In spurts of inspiration I write a fair few short pieces like the one above that I end up deeming unworthy, that I don't feel sure of — but y'know, a blog post needn't be perfect to be pleasingly thought-provoking.

  <p><label>Posted on <strong>05 January 2021</strong></label></p><p>A few weeks ago I tried to go through Advent of Code 2020 (spoiler I didn't finish). Advent of Code is a set of 25 coding challenges each with two parts. The challenges are unveiled one at a time from the beginning of December until Christmas day.   </p>
<p>One fun thing about Advent of Code is that everyone does it differently. People write solutions in every language out there (and some new ones they've invented) using many different techniques (I'm sure there's someone who tries to do the whole thing in regex).  </p>
<p>I found part 2 of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8">problem 8</a> to be very interesting and wanted to write up my solution.  </p>
<p><strong>A Quick Summary of the Problem</strong><br>
Part 2 of day 8 basically boils down to the following:<br>
We have a very simple machine. Initially there is a program counter, which starts at the beginning of the program, and a single global counter, which starts at 0. At each step, the instruction that the counter is pointing to is executed. There are 3 different instruction types each taking an integer parameter:  </p>
<ul>
<li>jmp arg, increments the program counter by arg  </li>
<li>add arg, adds arg to a global counter and increments the program counter by 1</li>
<li>nop arg, increments the program counter by 1. It does not use its argument but it still takes one  </li>
</ul>
<p>If the counter ends up pointing one index past the last instruction, the program ends and returns the global counter value.  </p>
<p>Here's an example program:<br>
0: nop +0<br>
1: acc +1<br>
2: jmp +2<br>
3: acc +5<br>
4: acc +2    </p>
<p>This program returns 3.   </p>
<p>What about this program?<br>
0: nop +0<br>
1: acc +1<br>
2: jmp +4<br>
3: acc +3<br>
4: jmp -3 <br>
5: acc -99<br>
6: acc +1<br>
7: jmp -4<br>
8: acc +6    </p>
<p>It never ends! If we trace the execution of this program, we will find out we are actually stuck in an infinite loop!  </p>
<p>In this problem, we can assume any looping program we encounter can be fixed by changing either a nop to a jmp or a jmp to a nop in exactly one place. Importantly the argument to the flipped jmp / nop does not change. In the above program changing instruction 7 to a nop will fix the program, allowing it to terminate with a value of 8.  </p>
<p>Our task is to take in a looping program, find the one flipped instruction, change it and get the return value of the terminating program.  </p>
<p><strong>The Simple Solution:</strong><br>
One simple thing we could do to find the solution is to try to flip each jmp and nop instruction, one at a time, and rerun the entire program after each flip. One of the flips is guaranteed to make the program stop looping and we will just return the result from that run. This solution is both straightforward and solves the problem which makes it a great solution. Algorithmically it runs in O(number of instructions^2) because we must run the entire program once for every instruction we flip.  </p>
<p>However in the spirit of doing each challenge in different ways I wondered if this problem could be done faster?  </p>
<p><strong>An Edgy Approach</strong><br>
Another way to think of these programs is as directed graphs. Each node represents an instruction and has an edge pointing towards the next executed instruction.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/advent/graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>I've now marked every instruction in the initial loop as red.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/advent/red-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>A quick but important fact is that the instruction that we need to flip must be in the initial loop. So it must be one of these original red instructions.   </p>
<p>Now we are going to try to flip each of the red jmp / nop these instructions one by one and check each time to see if the modified program terminates.  </p>
<p>What?! Isn't that exactly what we did in the N^2 solution above? It turns out the difference will be not in the number of instructions we try to flip, but how we check for program termination.  </p>
<p>Before we start our algorithm, let's create a set called cyclic_nodes. This is a subset of all the nodes which are guaranteed to connect to a cycle in the unmodified graph. Initially this set will contain all the red nodes in the first loop.   </p>
<p>Now let's try flipping one of our red jmp / nop nodes (call it Node A). That node's edge now points somewhere else in the graph (Node B). There are two cases here:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Node B is already in cyclic_nodes. This means that we are guaranteed to get stuck in a cycle so we can know Node A isn't the correct node to flip. To see why consider these two sub cases: <ul>
<li>There is a path from Node B to Node A. In this case we know we are still in a cycle. We know this because even though the graph has been modified, the only modification is to the edge leaving Node A so none of the nodes on the path from B to A will have been changed.  </li>
<li>There is a path from Node B to a different cycle. By similar logic to the first part, since no node on that path or in that cycle has been modified the program will loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Node A points to a node not yet in cyclic nodes. In this case we follow the path until we either hit a node in cyclic nodes, loop in a never before seen cycle, or hit the end of the program.<ul>
<li>If we hit the end of the program we have found the instruction to flip and we are done</li>
<li>In the other two cases we have entered a cycle. Add all nodes we walked over to the cyclic_nodes set and move to the next instruction. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the runtime of this algorithm? Well we only go over each potential switch once. However unlike the simple algorithm, we also know during the check for cycle step each node is only added to the cyclic_nodes set once. Therefore the runtime is linear with respect to the number of instructions.</p>
