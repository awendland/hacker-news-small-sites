February 11, 2021 | https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it! After the processing time (usually between 10 to 15 minutes) your library will be available to <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">MavenCentral</a>.</p><p>If you have any suggestion or any kind of doubt, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

		<h3>Deep learning is revolutionizing text-to-speech and speech synthesis technologies.</h3>
<p><strong>By Yishay Carmiel and Ben Lorica.</strong></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) and speech models have made voice applications accessible to companies across industries. From smartphone applications and personal assistants to sales and customer support to smart home speakers and appliances, voice applications have become part of daily life. Advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence technologies—natural language understanding (NLU) in particular—have brought voice technologies to a broader developer audience and greatly expanded practical use case scenarios.</p>
<p>While much of the recent media coverage and attention-grabbing applications have focused on automatic speech recognition (ASR), in this post, we’ll focus on text to speech (TTS) and speech synthesis—technologies that create artificial human speech.</p>
<p>As consumers integrate speech technology into their daily lives with such products as smart speakers and smart home systems, they increasingly will demand higher quality and more <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/960299623/voice-author-explores-accents-language-and-what-makes-a-tone-sexy">realistic speech synthesis</a>. We expect TTS and speech synthesis to drive the next wave of innovative voice applications. In 2018, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Google Duplex</a> introduced a system that previewed capabilities that speech synthesis and NLU technologies might be able to achieve. The system demonstrated personal assistants capable of booking appointments by interacting with humans through phone conversations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis#Applications">Assistive technology</a> use cases in healthcare will also drive innovation in speech synthesis, bringing maturity to impaired communication aids and novel solutions for a wide range of disabilities. We expect to see highly advanced applications that can, for example, serve as the voice for a patient with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/19/vocal-polyps-injury-singing-john-colapinto-steven-zeitels">damaged vocal chords</a>, using their own voice.</p>
<p>At a high level, voice applications have three main components: speech recognition, speech profiling, and speech synthesis.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">Speech recognition</a> is the translation of spoken language into text. It is also called automatic speech recognition, computer speech recognition, and speech to text. A major application of ASR is transcribing conversations. Other examples include “Hey, Siri” commands, such as “call home,” and voice interfaces requiring simple data entry (e.g., entering credit card numbers or call routing—”press or say ‘1’ for customer service”).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-0263-3_4">Speech profiling</a> is the process of audio mining information from speech beyond recognition, including age, gender, emotion, the language spoken, speaker verification, etc. Applications include biometrics, sentiment analysis, and metadata extraction to improve customer intelligence initiatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">Speech synthesis</a> is the artificial creation of human speech. In this post we’ll occasionally use the term “speech synthesis” to refer to technologies that cut across TTS and speech synthesis. The more familiar term is “text-to-speech” but we’re opting for “speech synthesis” because we expect input sources in the future to include a range of formats including text and audio. An example of a system that can take audio input is <a href="https://tencent-ailab.github.io/pitch-net/">Tencent’s PitchNet</a>: a model that takes audio of one singing voice and converts it into audio of another voice singing the same content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Overview of Speech Synthesis Systems</h2>
<p>Voice applications are complex. A close look at voice-enabled AI conversation applications, for instance, reveals the complexity of components on which such applications rely. Each of the components in Figure 1, for example, might require multiple machine learning (ML) models.</p>

<p>The fact that speech technologies mainly interact with humans increases their complexity. Most machine learning systems use quantitative metrics to measure the effectiveness or accuracy of their outputs. If an ML system is designed to catalogue species of birds, for example, it’s straightforward to score the accuracy. The output of voice applications is meant for human listening and requires qualitative metrics evaluated by a panel of humans. A common metric is the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), where a panel of listeners rates the output of a speech synthesis system using a range of 1 (lowest perceived quality) to 5 (highest perceived quality).</p>
<h3>Classical Text-to-Speech and Speech Synthesis systems</h3>
<p>Until the mid-2010’s when voice applications began integrating deep learning technologies, systems for producing artificial voices had two main components: natural language understanding and signal generation.</p>
<h4>Natural language understanding</h4>
<p>Natural language understanding is the process of a machine learning the peculiarities of language and understanding language components in context. In English, consider “1939.” The proper rendering of 1939 into speech depends on the context. NLU’s job is to understand the context and properly parse “1939.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My father was born in 1939 (“nineteen thirty-nine”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please press 1939 (“one-nine-three-nine”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This computer costs $1939 (“one thousand nine hundred thirty-nine”)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Classical NLU systems first pass text through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_normalization">normalization system</a> which converts text into a canonical, standard form that can more easily be rendered into speech. Next, the system passes the converted text through additional systems that turn it into linguistic units of sound called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">phonemes</a>. These units get assembled together using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)">prosody</a> model that ensures words and sentences sound correct.</p>
<h4>Signal generation</h4>
<p>Signal generation is the process of taking the text output from the NLU component and turning it into a realistic sounding voice. Early signal generation systems used a voice concatenation approach that recorded uttered parts of speech, such as phonemes or combinations of phonemes, and concatenated them while maintaining prosody and intonation. In principle, this system could generate speech from any text presented to it. Concatenation systems are complex and produce outputs that aren’t as realistic as modern deep learning-based systems.</p>

<h3>The rise of deep learning for speech synthesis</h3>
<p>Deep learning has revolutionized systems for producing artificial voices. Two main components, in particular, have seen significant innovation: the process of converting text to a <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/examples/audio_processing/spectrogram.html">high-level audio representation</a>, and the process of converting those representations into speech. Two deep learning models, WaveNet in 2016 and Tacotron in 2017, provided such significant improvements over existing systems that deep learning has now become central to modern speech platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet">WaveNet</a>, a neural <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/vocoder">vocoder</a> system from DeepMind, is a deep learning model trained on speech recordings. It is used to produce human-like voices. You can hear it in action on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Google Cloud Text-to-Speech</a> service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135">Tacotron</a> is a deep learning-based text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from text characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the introduction of WaveNet and Tacotron, major components of speech synthesis systems have come to rely on deep learning. Neither system, however, is an end-to-end (e2e) solution. Speech synthesis systems are composed of several components that are built and trained separately (see Figure 3). This means each component has to be trained individually, with its own training data. The speech synthesis system then relies on sequentially training each component in the pipeline. WaveNet and Tacotron each address one component of the end-to-end pipeline.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03575">2020 paper from DeepMind</a> introduced an end-to-end (e2e) speech synthesis model that takes an input (text, phonemes) and outputs raw speech waveforms. e2e systems are also being investigated <a href="https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1314615419156586496">in automatic speech recognition</a>. While end-to-end speech synthesis systems have attracted the attention of many researchers, it’s important to note that we are in the earliest stages of realizing an e2e system that can take an input and fully process a reasonable human-like output in real time.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>There are several active areas of research in speech synthesis. Each offers a myriad of applications and use cases, along with risk/reward trade-offs.</p>
<h3>Adaptable speech synthesis</h3>
<p>In today’s applications, it takes hours of recording and tuning for a speech synthesis system to output a specific person’s voice. What if we could take an existing, realistic sounding speech synthesis system and imbue it with specific voices with only minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s voice recording? A highly personalized, realistic speech synthesis system could revolutionize an unlimited number of applications. The reality of such a system isn’t as far off as it sounds: open source cloning systems that require only a few minutes of recorded audio of a speaker’s voice are <a href="https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning">already available</a>, and are bound to improve over time. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/build-a-natural-custom-voice-for-your-brand/ba-p/2112777">Microsoft recently announced an offering</a> that allows companies to create custom synthetic voices.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, we expect to see mainstream speech synthesis systems advanced enough to generate <a href="https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/multilingual/index.html">multilingual audio using the same voice</a>. This would drive interesting applications for travel, media and movies, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiiSAvKJIHo&amp;feature=youtu.be">public service initiatives</a>, to name just a few use cases.</p>
<p>There are obvious risks of adaptable speech synthesis systems. Fraudulently impersonating someone—using <a href="https://www.nisos.com/blog/synthetic-audio-deepfake/">audio deepfakes</a>—is becoming trivial and opens up many potential nefarious applications. A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402">Wall Street Journal article</a> described how fraudsters were able to impersonate the voice of an executive and demand a wire transfer. As the technology becomes more sophisticated, blackhat users likely will become more sophisticated as well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>This series is about me learning something in my spare time. More specifically, it’s about me learning quantum mechanics, as a way of getting back into physics, and as a way of making good science.</p> <p>I’ll explain: I have recently started a PhD in machine learning at the University of Geneva. The main project I’ll be working on is about applying machine learning and statistical methods to physics, mainly high energy physics (HEP) and solar astronomy. I am part of a very strong multidisciplinary team of physicists and AI people, so I could probably do without a strong physics background. Still, I feel like that can’t hurt, right?</p> <p>So there you have it: I want to study and understand physics in order to do better research.</p> <p>But that’s not the whole story. I also love physics, and I have tortured myself over and over as to whether I should have majored in physics rather that CS during my university career. This is not to say that I am any good at it. I only had one big physics exam during my bachelor (topics were kinematics, some classical mechanics, electromagnetism), and all the rest of my knowledge is made of bits and pieces coming from random youtube lectures and non-technical books I have read over the years. So yeah, it’s finally time to get serious.</p> <h3 id="why-start-with-quantum-mechanics"> <a href="#why-start-with-quantum-mechanics"></a> Why start with Quantum Mechanics? </h3> <p>Because I find it exciting, and that’s probably enough. Starting with classical mechanics would likely bore me to death. I know QM is not easy or intuitive, and that math can get hard. However, I don’t feel completely ill-equipped. Thanks to my engineering and ML background, I know one thing or two about probabilities, linear algebra, Fourier series and complex numbers, which I have been told are a substantial part of the required background.</p> <h3 id="what-is-your-study-method"> <a href="#what-is-your-study-method"></a> What is your study method? </h3> <p>I usually try to be extremely deliberate about my study method. I won’t go into the details here, but I use active recall and spatial repetition tools such as Anki so that remembering what I study is no longer a random event but a purposeful act. There are many interesting resources about such techniques, such as <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">this</a>, and <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/spacedrepetition/">this</a>. Michael Nielsen has even developed an <a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">introduction to quantum computing</a> delivered in a “new mnemonic medium which makes it almost effortless to remember what you read” (hint: it’s active recall and spaced repetition).</p> <p>As for the learning resources, I have chosen two introductory books: one is from the theoretical minimum series from the great Leonard Susskind. This is supposed to be a very simple introduction, starting from first principles. I have already flipped through the pages, and there actually seems to be quite a lot of content, or at least more than you would expect from a book of this kind.</p> <p>The second book it more technical, and it comes up over and over as a suggestion for learning QM: Griffiths’ Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. Honestly, here I have no idea what to expect.</p> <p>So here’t the plan: I’ll go through both books simultaneously and try to solve most exercises. I’ll also create flashcards and diagrams of the concepts, and let Anki do the rest. Additionally, I’ll write this blog series, which hopefully helps me understand things better. So if you are here to learn, don’t just count on my writing.</p> <h3 id="requirements"> <a href="#requirements"></a> Requirements </h3> <p>The requirements are basic linear algebra and basic probability. And complex numbers. Some notions of classical physics can also help.</p> <hr> <h2 id="spins-and-qubits"> <a href="#spins-and-qubits"></a> Spins and Qubits </h2> <p>The fact that we cannot fully grasp some things about the inner workings of our universe should come at no surprise. After all, we evolved to survive, not to understand. Ok yes, we have a strong intuition for many classical-mechanical things, but the reason is that things that behave classically are closer to our experience than things that behave relativistically or in a quantum mechanical way. So what we can do here is simple: let’s just go with the math and with the experiment. I don’t expect any of the concepts I encounter to be “relatable”. I am going to trust the result of the experiments, and link that to the math which hopefully explains them. And I’ll start with the <strong>spin</strong>.</p> <p>Sooo, the spin is an extra degree of freedom that some particle have (all of them? I don’t know).</p> <p>This spin is a very quantum mechanical concept, which is why trying to visualize it classically would miss the point.</p> <p>Now, the spin of a particle is a quantum systems on its own right. In fact, it’s the “simplest and the most quantum of systems”, according to Susskind. Just by going through a very simple experiment involving the spin, we can already start to notice some important differences between classical physics and quantum mechanics.</p> <p>The experiment involves a measuring system, which we call $\mathcal{A}$, that records the state of the spin of our system (we’ll call it $\sigma$). We can orient the measuring apparatus in order to measure this “something” along a specified axis. As a test, we rotate the apparatus along the $z$-axis, and notice that our measurement has the value of $1$ or $-1$.</p> <p>Now, if we reset the apparatus to measure again the spin along the $z$-axis, and assume the simple evolution law</p><p> \[\sigma(n+1) = \sigma(n)\] </p><p>which tells us that the state of the system remains unchanged through time, then the previous measurement should be confirmed, again and again. We say that the measurement of a state <strong>prepares the system.</strong></p> <p>In quantum experiments, performing the same measurement repeatedly gives the same answer until the system is prepared differently. We will see this in more detail now.</p> <p>After we have prepared the system in the state $\sigma_z = 1$, let’s now rotate the apparatus of, say, 90 degrees, and measure the spin along the $x$-axis. Something weird happens. Sometimes we get +1, sometimes we get -1. It looks like the result is no longer deterministic, but in some peculiar way. In fact, if we repeat the experiment multiple times, we find that the average value of the measurement along the $x$-axis is $0$.</p> <p>In fact, this is generalizable to any direction. We can pick any direction $\hat{m}$ and prepare a spin so that the apparatus measures a $+1$ in that direction. Then, we rotate the apparatus to any other direction $\hat{n}$. Again, the result of the measurement will still be either $+1$ or $-1$, but the expected value will be equal to the projection of $\hat{m}$ over $\hat{n}$ , that is, $\cos{\theta}$, with $\theta$ being the angle between the vectors.</p> <p>In <em>bra-ket notation</em> (we’ll talk about this more in detail)<em>:</em></p><p> \[\langle{\sigma}\rangle = \hat{m} \cdot\hat{n} = \cos{\theta}\] </p><p>Notice that this is the same result that we would expect in classical physics for some vector quantity that we measure. However, in the classical sense, the result would be deterministic. In QM, the result is statistically random, but the average converges to the classical result.</p> <h2 id="vector-spaces-inner-products-bases"> <a href="#vector-spaces-inner-products-bases"></a> Vector spaces, inner products, bases. </h2> <p>In quantum mechanics the space of the states is a vector space. We call vectors <em>ket.</em> This is a <em>ket:</em> $\vert a\rangle$. Some simple axioms are defined in this space: the sum of two kets is a ket, ket addition is commutative and associative, and some other things like the existence of a 0 vector, an additive inverse, and linearity. Up to this point, everything looks normal, and the vector space we have defined is practically the same as the space of 3-vectors in Euclidean space. However, the space of our <em>kets</em> is a complex vector space, made of complex numbers, and where the multiplication by a scalar value also extends to complex numbers! This is a very abstract concept, but it’s absolutely needed to make the theory work mathematically.</p> <p>Now, if you know something about complex vector, you will likely remember about the complex conjugate. Briefly, given a complex number $z$, there exists a complex conjugate $z^*$ that we obtain by reversing the sign of the imaginary part. So if $z=x+iy = re^{i\theta}$, then $z^*=x-iy = re^{-i\theta}$. Note that the product of a complex number and its complex conjugate is always positive, yielding $r^2$ in our case.</p> <p>In the same way, a complex vector space has a <em>dual</em> space that is its complex conjugate vector space. In our case, for every <em>ket</em> $\vert A\rangle$, we can define a <em>bra</em> vector in that dual space: $\langle A \vert$, which is essentially its complex conjugate.</p> <p>Now, if you got up to this point, I am pretty sure you remember about dot-products in Euclidean space, right? Well, that dot-product is a specific instance of so-called <em>inner products,</em> which we can also define in our complex space. In out quantum-mechanical magical world, the inner product is defined between a <em>bra</em> and a <em>ket</em>, and the notation is</p><p> \[\langle B|A \rangle\] </p><p>and, of course, the result is a complex number. These products are linear, and interchanging bras and kets corresponds to complex conjugation</p><p> \[\langle B|A \rangle = \langle A|B \rangle ^*\] </p><p>Concretely, the product is performed in the exact same way as for the dot-product: sum of the products of the components.</p> <p>We can also bring with us some familiar concepts from Euclidean spaces:</p> <ul> <li>A vector is <em>normalized</em> if its inner products with itself is 1.</li> <li>Two vectors are <em>orthogonal</em> if their inner products is 0.</li> </ul> <p>In our vector space, we can also define a <em>basis</em>, which is simply a set of vector that can be used to derive any other vector in the space through linear combinations. It’s often useful, and it is especially in QM, to talk about <em>orthonormal bases</em>, which are <em>bases</em> where the vectors are normalized and orthogonal between each other. Note that the number of vectors in a <em>basis</em> is equivalent to the dimension of the space.</p> <h3 id="quantum-states"> <a href="#quantum-states"></a> Quantum States </h3> <p>With some math tools under our belt, let’s try to formalize the notion of a <em>spin state</em> from earlier.

        <p>Continuing from <a href="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/blog/2021/01/25/images-functor">image editing with Functors</a>, we will now understand Applicative by editing images with it.</p>

<h3 id="applicative">Applicative</h3>
<p>An applicative is composed of 2 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A function which can wrap any value <code>A</code> with the context <code>F</code>. <code>pure(a: A): F[A]</code>. So it must be that <code>pure</code> knows what the <code>F</code> context means.</li>
  <li>One of the two functions which are equivalent to each other (can rewrite one in terms of the other + <code>pure</code>):
    <ul>
      <li><code>map2(a: F[A], b: F[B], f: (A, B) =&gt; C): F[C]</code></li>
      <li><code>app(f: F[A =&gt; B], a: F[A]): F[B]</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Below <code>app</code> is used with the enhanced syntax:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span>
<span>//where fab is of type F[A =&gt; B]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This structure must obey the laws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identity</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fa</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Homomorphism</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Interchange</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>ff</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Composition</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>compose</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>B</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>_</span><span>.</span><span>compose</span>
<span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>compose</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fbc</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fbc</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These laws are a bit complicated, so again like Functors we will check them with Cats laws. The tests are more fine 
grained than only these 4 laws so if some fail we will get a better idea what and where to fix.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkAll</span><span>(</span><span>"Applicative laws"</span><span>,</span> <span>ApplicativeTests</span><span>(</span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>imApplicative</span><span>).</span><span>applicative</span><span>[</span><span>Int</span>, <span>Int</span>, <span>String</span><span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="map2">Map2</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]`</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This says it can merge two contexts. The <code>f</code> function knows how to merge A and B into a new value C,
but <code>map2</code> knows (just like <code>pure</code>) about what the <code>F</code> context means, so it actually knows to merge both contexts together.
We can replace the word “context” with “effect”:  map2 knows how to merge two effects.</p>

<h4 id="apply">Apply</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is more tricky to understand intuitively but given a function/program wrapped in the context/effect <code>F</code>,
we can run the program with the value in <code>a: F[A]</code>.
Not to be confused with the functor’s <code>map(a: F[A], f: A =&gt; B): F[B]</code> - there is an extra <code>F</code> over <code>f</code> in apply.</p>

<p>Because <code>apply</code> also gets as input two <code>F</code>s and returns only one it means that it also knows how to merge these <code>F</code>s (just like <code>map2</code>)</p>

<h4 id="map2-vs-apply">Map2 vs Apply</h4>
<p>So what is the difference? Formally none because we can write one in terms of the other + pure</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map2</span><span>[</span><span>F</span><span>[</span><span>_</span><span>]</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span>, <span>C</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>fb</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>one</span> <span>=</span> <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>curried</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>one</span><span>)(</span><span>fb</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>ff</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>])(</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>,</span> <span>fa</span><span>)((</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So it’s clear that both <code>map2</code> and <code>apply</code> know how to merge F contexts/effects, but what about the difference in signatures?</p>

<p><code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>.
It kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside. More precisely it’s a program which ran with input A will produce a F[B].
We’ll see this below on images.</p>

<h4 id="applicative-is-also-a-functor">Applicative is also a Functor</h4>
<p>The complete name is: <a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf">applicative functor</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But functor is not an applicative, functor does not have <code>pure</code> so it does not know as much about what <code>F</code> means.</p>

<h4 id="applicative-on-images">Applicative on images</h4>

      <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Given F is an Image it means we can combine any 2 images, pixel by pixel. Of course, if we can combine 2 images we can also combine any N images.</p>

<h3 id="getting-more-intuition-on-map2-and-apply">Getting more intuition on Map2 and Apply</h3>

<p>We define a program in our F (Image), which will generate a checkers-like pattern.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala">    <span>def</span> <span>checkerPattern</span><span>:</span> <span>Image</span><span>[</span><span>Color</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Color</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>else</span> <span>c</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will run this program giving it as input the original bird image, and we get</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>checkerPattern</span><span>)(</span><span>bird</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>Now let’s create the same result with map2.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>bird</span><span>,</span> <span>checkerPattern</span><span>)((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBirdPlusNoBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>I’m going to repeat myself because this is awesome:<br>
<code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>,
<strong>it kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside</strong>. We can even extract this core image from our checkerPattern program in order to see it by giving it the transparent color:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkerPattern</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span>
<span>//OR</span>
<span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>checkerPattern</span><span>)(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/checker.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>And one more fun example, combined with the bird image:</p>

February 10, 2021 | https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

<p><span><span>Important News!&nbsp; February 4, 2021</span></span></p>

<p justify="" text-align:=""><span><span>First the good news. The repairing/rebuilding of Aurora Clocks will likely continue for many years.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Now some&nbsp;bad news.&nbsp; We just sold the last of the new cases we used for&nbsp;new Auroras.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The availability of new Auroras are becoming&nbsp;problematic. Here's the story.&nbsp; For 60 years one&nbsp;company, Hansen motors,&nbsp; has been manufacturing the motor and&nbsp;"special"&nbsp;movements for the Aurora.&nbsp; Hansen was bought&nbsp;a couple of years ago and the new owners have decided to discontinue production of all&nbsp;clock&nbsp;movements.&nbsp; The movement is a&nbsp;gear-train that moves&nbsp;the hour and minute hands.&nbsp; They will continue making the motors which will allow us to keep doing repairs for a long time.&nbsp; And more good news, &nbsp;95% of the&nbsp;movements never fail even after 40 years.&nbsp; They just need a little oil every 25 years.&nbsp; So that's the "movement news, but there is more....</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Other partially good news, I have about 140 of new Aurora movements, but now&nbsp;another problem,&nbsp;I &nbsp;don't feel like&nbsp;investing another $16,000 in a batch of new Aurora cases to go with those movements without some encouragement.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Last time this happened was 10 years ago.&nbsp;Here is a similar plan to what I did then.&nbsp; If enough customers send&nbsp;in $100 deposits/clock we will&nbsp;put them back in production. And I would not cash the checks until I had decided to go ahead. And they would only be charged $459 more for each Aurora + shipping.&nbsp; Last time, about 25 customers sent in checks for about 30 Auroras so I went ahead.&nbsp; It takes about 4 months from ordering new Aurora cases to shipping your clocks to you.  And it way take 2-4 months to get enought deposit checks.</span></span></span></span></p>
			<p><span><span><span><span>For your reference, since new Auroras were becoming scarce I was raising the price during the last month of production.  The last ones were sold for $699 plus shipping.  So the customer sending in deposit checks will be saving between $100 to $140/clock. </span></span></span></span></p>
			<p><span><span><span><span>The world keeps changing.&nbsp; But I am Mr. Persistent, a.k.a. Barry Gamble.&nbsp; Take care my friends.  Hey, I just get my 1st COVID vaccine shot yesterday.  Yea!</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Google (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7380435?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-you-determine-that-a-site-is-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Google</a>, its Safe Browsing system works by scanning sections of Google’s web index and “identifying potentially compromised websites.” Then, Google tests those websites by using a virtual machine to check if the website compromises the system. If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-39225" data-id="39225" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/" title="Siri_Default_Music_App"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg" alt="Siri Default Music App" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-293x293.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot see users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s the most successful rebranding of the past 10 years? Airbnb? Google? Burger King? Nope. The award goes to….🥁🥁🥁….skipping breakfast! What was once best known as an excuse for lazy teenagers who didn’t feel like making a bowl of cereal is now being shouted from the rooftops from health enthusiasts and experts. Its new name: intermittent fasting.</p><p>For those that aren’t aware, there is an unwritten rule of intermittent fasting: you must unabashedly tell all your friends and family about how amazing it is. After a couple months of trying it out, it’s time for me to follow orders.</p><h2 id="fasting-101">Fasting 101</h2><p>When we think of nutrition, we often focus on how much we eat (calories) and what we eat (fats carbs, proteins, etc.) However, there is an important and often underemphasized third dimension: when we eat. As described on a popular fasting app’s <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/why-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Three meals a day is a modern accident. Our metabolisms are programmed for periods of feast and famine. Unlike constantly-grazing cows with four stomachs, we aren’t built to maintain a constant drip of food.</p></blockquote><p>The gist of intermittent fasting is to reduce your eating window. There are a variety of styles. The 13:11 Circadian Rhythm style consists of a 13 hour fast followed by an 11 hour eating window. It tries to replicate the body’s natural clock by fasting roughly after sunset until morning. The 16:8 is the most popular. To reach the 16 hour fasting goal, it’s common to fast from dinner to lunch the next day. Aka skipping breakfast.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-fasting">The Benefits of Fasting</h2><p>People are excited about intermittent fasting for good reason. Numerous studies show promising physical and mental benefits. For example, it can help you:</p><ul><li>⚡️ Boost energy</li><li>💪 Lose weight</li><li>✨ Reduce inflammation</li><li>🩸 Reduce insulin resistance (driver of Type 2 diabetes)</li><li>🧠 Increase mental clarity</li></ul><p>You can read about these benefits and others in more detail <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2><p>Today is my 65th day in a row fasting and I plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. I’m impressed with its ease and effectiveness.</p><p>I started with a 13:11 style and quickly moved to a 16:8 structure. I skip breakfast and have my first meal around 12-2pm. During the first week I was a little hungry and tired in the morning, but now I feel great right up until my first meal of the day. In fact, I now frequently extend the fast to 16-20 hours.</p><p>I’ve noticed a number of physical and mental benefits. And unlike other dietary changes I actually enjoy it. I can harness my inner teenager and be lazy about breakfast. If I feel like ice cream I can have some damn ice cream and not feel guilty about it. In return, I have more energy and mental clarity. I’m also at my lowest weight level and % body fat since the prime of my collegiate soccer days. Below is how its impacted my weight so far:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>As I learned in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945404-the-obesity-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Obesity Code</a>, we have a natural weight set point. Kinda like a body weight thermostat. While traditional diets that focus on calorie reduction can help you lost weight in the short term, they rarely work long term because we naturally gravitate back to our set point. In contrast, fasting can actually change your set point, enabling long term weight change. While it’s still early, my initial results are promising.</p><p>While my experience has been positive, it’s important to mention that <strong>fasting is NOT for everyone</strong>. Everybody’s body responds differently. Accordingly, it’s important to consult a doctor before trying it. This is especially true if you have diabetes, have problems with blood sugar regulation, take medications, are underweight, have a history of eating disorders, or are pregnant.</p><h2 id="fasting-tips">Fasting Tips</h2><p>The Obesity Code contains a bunch of great intermittent fasting tips. I wouldn’t have been able to beat the initial hunger and fatigue without them. Straight from the book:</p><ul><li>💧 <strong>Drink water</strong>: Start each morning with a full eight-ounce glass of water.</li><li>🤹‍♂️ <strong>Stay busy</strong>: It’ll keep your mind off food.</li><li>☕️ <strong>Drink coffee</strong>: Coffee is a mild appetite suppressant. Green tea, black tea and bone broth may also help.</li><li>🏄‍♂️ <strong>Ride the waves</strong>: Hunger comes in waves; it is not continuous. When it hits, slowly drink a glass of water or a hot cup of coffee. Often by the time you’ve finished, your hunger will have passed.</li><li>🤫 <strong>Don’t tell everybody you are fasting</strong>: Most people will try to discourage you, as they do not understand the benefits. A close-knit support group is beneficial, but telling everybody you know is not a good idea.</li><li>📅 <strong>Give yourself one month</strong>: It takes time for your body to get used to fasting. The first few times you fast may be difficult, so be prepared. Don’t be discouraged. It will get easier.</li><li>🥑 <strong>Follow a nutritious diet on non-fast days</strong>: Intermittent fasting is not an excuse to eat whatever you like. During non-fasting days, stick to a nutritious diet low in sugars and refined carbohydrates.</li><li>🍽 <strong>Don’t binge</strong>: After fasting, pretend it never happened. Eat normally, as if you had never fasted</li></ul><p>Interested in learning more?

<p>Sennett Devermont is a police accountability activist whose streams police encounters to his Instagram followers. When he visited the Beverly Hills Police Department last Fri to obtain a form, BHPD Sergeant Billy Fair recognized him and began blasting music from of his phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/</a></p>
<p>Fair was following the example of other BHPD officers who have made a habit of playing copyrighted music during encounters with the public, apparently to trigger automated copyright takedowns on the major social media platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed">https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed</a></p>
<p>As Dexter Thomas writes for Vice, this form of copyfraud has a failsafe: if the filter doesn't block the livestream, the archived footage might be easily removed through copyright complaints.</p>
<p>Instagram's copyright policy suggests that videos with incidental music are permitted, but the company's filters are incapable of distinguishing "incidental" and "non-incidental" use, while its appeals process is a long-running production of Kafka's Trial.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the platforms use a "copystrike" system, which means that cops who successfully deploy this tactic can chip away at activists' presence on the system – three strikes and their accounts are permanently removed.</p>
<p>Thomas: "…[P]laying copyrighted music as a deterrent to the First Amendment-guaranteed right to openly film police is, if not BHPD official protocol, at least a technique that has been deployed by more than one officer."</p>
<p>Back in 2019, anti-racist activists experimented with playing copyrighted music at Nazi rallies to make them unpostable on social media. At the time, I warned that this would end badly.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/</a></p>
<p>Exactly a year later, BLM protest videos started disappearing from the internet thanks to copyfraud and overactive copyright filters.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets</a></p>
<p>Copyright filters are a terrible idea, not just because they have all but eliminated the ability of musicians to perform classical music online:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet</a></p>
<p>Nor merely because they allow giant companies to steal from independent video creators:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id</a></p>
<p>They're a bad idea because they create a backdoor system for censorship of any and all material – because they fray the fabric of our online speech forums, and give bullies a devastating weapon to use against those who document their crimes.</p>

<p>Two of the most astute IP scholars I know also happen to be two of the best legal writers I know, and also happen to work at one of the worst IP abusers in the country: Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, of Duke University, the nation's leading academic trademark abuser.</p>
<p>Duke has a universal reputation for being a serious trademark abuser, but Jenkins and Boyle wanted to empirically investigate that reputation. The result is "Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully," forthcoming in Fordham IPLJ.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381</a></p>
<p>To do empirical work, you have to find stuff to count. The problem is that questions like "who is the biggest bully?" are stubbornly qualitative, and quantizing Duke's conduct risks incinerating the most important elements in the quest for some kind of quantitative residue.</p>
<p>But the authors hit on a very good quantitative/qualitative methodology: they would count trademark oppositions, which are legal filings sent after a trademark has received preliminary approval. That way, they'd be counting oppositions to trademarks that had some merit.</p>
<p>Even better: trademark oppositions have to be accompanied by legal arguments explaining why the university thinks the trademark should be blocked, and that produces a qualitative account of how Duke thinks about its trademark.</p>
<p>Then Jenkins and Boyle used their considerable legal knowledge to characterize each opposition's argument on the basis of how plausible or stupid it was, quantizing the qualitative question of whether Duke's lawyers were fucking around.</p>
<p>Some background: universities have reinvented themselves as brand-factories and oriented their activities around slapping their logos on random shit and selling it. That's why Ohio State applied for a trademark on, I shit you not, the word "the."</p>
<p>Boise State asked for a trademark on all non-green football fields. U Texas wants the trademark over making devil horns with your fingers ("I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of metalheads suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").</p>
<p>The trademark and licensing business is a squalid affair. The (grossly overstated, rarely realized) risk of a mark lapsing into the public domain ("genericide") justifies endless bullying of people who say and do normal things that glance off your trademarks.</p>
<p>Trademark was established to protect buyers, by allowing the makers of well-known goods to punish rivals who sought to deceive their customers. Over the years, trademark has been distorted into just another grift, a way to make the rich, richer.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, citing Mark Lemley et al, there's no good trademark justification for allowing a university to snuff out "counterfeit" tees  – the buyers of these items haven't been tricked into getting a bargain on a way to advertise their team allegiance.</p>
<p>But the expansion of trademark into an economic right for mark-makers (and away from a way of protecting the public from deceptive sellers), combined with the bogeyman of genericide add up to a perfect business for the greedy and unscrupulous. For bullies.</p>
<p>So, is Duke a bully?</p>
<p>Oh shit yes.</p>
<p>Let's look at some graphs. Here's how Duke stacks up against comparable US institutions in terms of how often it challenges a trademark.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>They slice this data many ways but it always looks like this: Duke is a huge outlier.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe those trademark cancellations are good, actually. So let's go to the quantized, hand-coded qualitative assessments of Duke's arguments.</p>
<p>They're garbage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>"85% of Duke’s oppositions were coded either clearly erroneous or far-fetched"</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe the authors are being mean to Duke. What's "erroneous or far-fetched?" Well, it seems that Duke challenges any trademark application containing "Duke," the letter "D," a devil, the world blue, or any word that sounds like "duke."</p>
<p>All of this is laid out with beautiful clarity in the paper, and the back third of the paper moves on to ask What It All Means – why is Duke such a godawful bully. The authors entertain several possibilities, like perverse incentives in trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But they don't draw conclusions. I have one, and it may be uncomfortable for my honorable and good lawyer friends, which is that law has a bullying problem. There are many fields where esoteric knowledge gives you the power to coerce others, but the law is especially bad.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of my experience of lawyers has been with people who fight for the underdog, but honestly, I think they're the exception. I had a very eye-opening experience about 15 years ago, when a friend asked me to come speak to some co-workers.</p>
<p>My friend worked at a giant company in a creative unit, and he asked me if I'd come speak to his group. It was close by home and I told him of course I'd do it. A day before I was meant to come by, he emailed apologetically to say that legal had sent him a contract for me.</p>
<p>Now, I wasn't charging this massive, profitable company a dime. It was a favor for a pal. But I looked at the contract and it was bonkers – like, I promised I'd never mention the name of the company in print, ever, without written permission.</p>
<p>I told my friend I couldn't sign that clause and he told me he understood, but the legal department wouldn't let me in the building unless I signed it. I canceled the talk. A couple months later, I met a lawyer from the company at a signing and I told him this story.</p>
<p>He grimaced and said he knew whose doing that was, another lawyer in the department who counted their successes by how badly they could humiliate the people who contracted with the company. He listed several of these, each more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a power-trip, it was sadism. And it's not limited to that lawyer or that company. I sent back two minor, small-dollar publishing contracts today that had abominable language in them – blanket indemnities, binding arbitration, huge rights grabs.</p>
<p>These aren't (or weren't) standard. There's no business reason for them. I mean, I <em>can't</em> indemnify a multinational corporation against all claims for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to hire lawyers to argue their case. I'd just go bust.</p>
<p>There is a toxic strain of competitive sadism in the law, an ethic of victory through someone else's humiliating defeat. If I had to guess why Duke smashes all those trademark applicants' dreams, I'd say that sadism is playing a major role.</p>

February 10, 2021 | https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

Now, they have conducted a clinical trial to study its efficacy. Trial participants who spent a total of four hours training with the app at home showed an improvement in their ability to handle real height situations.</p><p>Fear of heights is a widespread phenomenon. Approximately 5% of the general population experiences a debilitating level of discomfort in height situations. However, the people affected rarely take advantage of the available treatment options, such as exposure therapy, which involves putting the person in the anxiety-causing situation under the guidance of a professional. On the one hand, people are reluctant to confront their fear of heights. On the other hand, it can be difficult to reproduce the right kinds of height situations in a therapy setting.</p><p>This motivated the interdisciplinary research team led by Professor Dominique de Quervain of the University of Basel to develop a smartphone-based virtual reality exposure therapy app called Easyheights. The app uses 360° images of real locations, which the researchers captured using a drone. People can use the app on their own smartphones together with a special virtual reality headset.</p><h2><b>Gradually increasing the height</b></h2><p>During the virtual experience, the user stands on a platform that is initially one meter above the ground. After allowing acclimatization to the situation for a certain interval, the platform automatically rises. In this way, the perceived distance above the ground increases slowly but steadily without an increase in the person’s level of fear.</p><p>The research team studied the efficacy of this approach in a randomized, controlled trial and published the results in the journal <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41746-021-00387-7&amp;t=NDM0YWJkZGNjNzRlNmZhNjFhYTA3ZWY2Yjg4YjA4ODMxYWE4Mzc0YixjTkoyZTgxNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F642786101323579392%2Fvr-fear-of-heights-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1613219939">NPJ Digital Medicine</a></i>. Fifty trial participants with a fear of heights either completed a four-hour height training program (one 60-minute session and six 30-minute sessions over the course of two weeks) using virtual reality, or were assigned to the control group, which did not complete these training sessions.</p><p>Before and after the training phase – or the same period of time without training – the trial participants ascended the Uetliberg lookout tower near Zurich as far as their fear of heights allowed them. The researchers recorded the height level reached by the participants along with their subjective fear level at each level of the tower. At the end of the trial, the researchers evaluated the results from 22 subjects who completed the Easyheights training and 25 from the control group.</p><figure data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a7d2ab9c5b854b35199b6c548b829d0e/bbcffefc0ed2b483-20/s1280x1920/7474345b9acfd469b9bf2042fe648c90b3c3accc.jpg" data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="1000" width="1000" height="750" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Advanced level of the virtual reality app. Credit: <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Virtual-reality-helping-to-treat-fear-of-heights.html">Bentz et al., NPJ Digital Medicine 2021</a>.</i></p><p>The group that completed the training with the app exhibited less fear on the tower and was able to ascend further towards the top than they could before completing the training. The control group exhibited no positive changes. The efficacy of the Easyheights training proved comparable to that of conventional exposure therapy.</p><h2><b>Therapy in your own living room</b></h2><p>Researchers have already been studying the use of virtual reality for treating fear of heights for more than two decades. “What is new, however, is that smartphones can be used to produce the virtual scenarios that previously required a technically complicated type of treatment, and this makes it much more accessible,” explains Dr. Dorothée Bentz, lead author of the study.</p><p>The results from the study suggest that the repeated use of a smartphone-based virtual reality exposure therapy can greatly improve the behavior and subjective state of well-being in height situations. People who suffer from a mild fear of heights will soon be able to download the free app from major app stores and complete training sessions on their own. However, the researchers recommend that people who suffer from a serious fear of heights only use the app with the supervision of a professional.</p><p>The current study is one of several projects in progress at the Transfaculty Research Platform for Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences, led by Professor Andreas Papassotiropoulos and Professor Dominique de Quervain. Their goal is to improve the treatment of mental disorders through the use of new technologies and to make these treatments widely available.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Virtual-reality-helping-to-treat-fear-of-heights.html">University of Basel</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Effectiveness of a stand-alone, smartphone-based virtual reality exposure app to reduce fear of heights in real-life: a randomized trial”,&nbsp;<i>NPJ Digital Medicine</i>.</p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00387-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00387-7</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/627900402450497536/personalized-ocd-treatment">New brain study could lead to more personalized OCD treatment</a></p>

			<p>If I’m repeatedly drawn to a thought, feeling, or belief, I write it out. I believe writing is the most practical tool we possess to think <em>far</em> more effectively.</p>
<p>For those of us with woefully average gray matter, our minds have a limited reach. Like an erratic compass needle, our minds cling to the most provocative fragments of ideas without helping us map the territory. <strong>Writing forces us to articulate things with a level of context and coherence we can’t achieve in the mind alone.</strong> Writing lets us expand our working memory. It also exposes the gaps — blind spots, falsity, bias, prejudice, ambiguity — in what we write.</p>
<p>At its best, writing (and reading) can help us confront the ugly and uncomfortable aspects of our nature. It can uproot ideas burrowed so deeply that they’ve imperceptibly shaped our feelings and beliefs. Sometimes this uprooting will reveal that the lustrous potential of a new idea was a mirage, or that your understanding about someone’s motives were incomplete, maybe even projected. <strong>Writing can be therapeutic.</strong>&nbsp;Sculpting the clay of your thoughts can bring clarity, spark ideas, and tidy mental clutter.</p>
<p>I also believe that <strong><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making writing a habit can encourage us to be more playful and attentive</a> as we walk this earth.</strong> Writing is a perfect excuse to do something off-kilter, to experience and document something new.</p>
<p>But writing is daunting. Chaotic and awkward. It’s so off-putting that I rarely encounter people in everyday life who enjoy, or at least don’t loathe, writing.</p>
<p>Our words expose us. Maybe the process of writing even shapes us over time. Even when we’re not writing something personal, our style pervades in the way we choose and arrange words. And this style certainly evolves.</p>
<p>This makes writing difficult, especially in the beginning. It forces us to fall short of our own expectations. <strong>Like the amateur chef trying again and again to emulate a great meal, we can recognize and appreciate good writing while not being able to create it.</strong> That’s frustrating. But that’s how skill development works. To improve, our taste for things must outstrip our ability to create them.</p>
<p>This imbalance between taste and ability also means you’ll encounter people who are eager to find flaws in your writing. Don’t receive negative feedback as an attack. A reader may be able to sense that something could be better, but they may not have the ability to explain it. Embrace scrutiny. Learn to convert critical feedback — and even cynical feedback — into better writing.</p>
<p>I don’t think writing is an isolated skill. Rather, I see it as a non-linear and gangly process of gathering, curating, organizing, creating, and refining ideas and information. It’s easy to overestimate (and romanticize) the role of creativity in the writing process. Creativity is often a byproduct of the other steps listed above. Reading is often the cleanest-burning fuel for this process.</p>
<h2>Writing at Work</h2>
<p>My career path compelled me to become a better writer, and I’m grateful for it. <strong>Writing well is a skill that complements nearly every professional role.</strong></p>
<p>When I cross paths with a skilled writer, I’m delighted, particularly when they can write or edit in ways I cannot. Their ability is easy to recognize. An email, or even a short conversation with no writing involved, can give them away. <strong>Good writers strive for relevance, brevity, and style, in that order.</strong></p>
<p>Writing well is not essential to becoming a leader or high earner. But if you have a white collar job, writing can almost certainly be a force multiplier. And it can be an asset as part of a company’s culture. By knowing how to parse and convey the right information, the good writer can relieve a myriad of headaches. Good writing can connect disjointed perspectives, give direction to a project, sell a service, solidify a shared purpose, document a process, and foster an evergreen knowledge-base.</p>
<p>In my unqualified opinion, good writer are also more likely to be effective generalists. Many of the best writers I’ve worked with were not writers. Several were designers, two were lawyers, one was a pharmacist, and one was a salesperson. These people often worked beyond their job titles and were called in to help untangle sensitive projects.</p>
<p><strong>You should write because it’s a way to help yourself and others.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/e75196b9-42f8-4808-8b8b-9157f238b570/xor.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Assembly code can appear mysterious to the uninitiated. Aspects of the physical machine abstracted away in higher-level languages are referred to directly in its terse commands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">This chapbook</a> of minimal assembly code poems (its author refers to them as "snippets") offers no solutions, context, or explanations to ease this gap, leaving the work of deciphering to the reader. For xorpd, its pseudonymous author, this is exactly the point: to immerse the reader in the machine level of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When working inside a computer, everything is eventually made of assembly, so this is where you go if you really want to understand how things work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no extraneous word of text in the book to break that context. The title, <code>xchg rax, rax</code>, is a NOP instruction (pronounced no-op, for no operation): xchg exchanges the data of two operands, in this case of rax with itself. The author's name, xorpd, is a bitwise logical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XOR (exclusive or)</a> of packed double-precision floating-point values. <span><br></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The xor logical operation is one of my favorites. It is the foundation for most of our modern cryptography.</p>
<p>The "xorpd" instruction allows xoring 128 bits at a time. It is really the kind of instruction you want to be when you grow up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full book can be found here</a> but is also available as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">lovely printed book</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially I wanted to publish the book through a publisher, but no publisher wanted to go with the "minimalistic" design. One publisher said he could publish the book if I added explanations for every code snippet, but I wasn't willing to do so.</p>
<p>Another friend recommended adding QR codes to the pages, linking to explanations, but I wasn't willing to do this either. I remember trying to decipher each of those code snippets myself, and I felt that I could not let my readers down by handing them an easy solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/e6b10eed-c3cc-4f59-afb6-580c6508c5f7/xorpd3.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>That lack of explanation, along with the monospaced font, gives the book the feel of conceptual poetry, perhaps an early Vito Acconci piece.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father opened one of the books and looked at it in amazement. He said something like "There is nothing inside the book, it's all strange short English words, who would want to buy something like this?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, much of the joy of the book comes from discovering the nuances of these tiny programs; many rely on assembly-specific tricks that do not really translate "up" into the virtual machines defined by higher-level programming languages.</p>
<p>Those who have trouble deciphering can view xorpd's video series <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/x86_adventures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembly Language Adventures</a>, which teaches assembly programming beginning with the very basics, reaching a level of expertise through 29 hours of instruction. Xorpd created the book as a companion piece while working on the video, pulling his favorite assembly snippets together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorites is:</p>

<div>
<pre>cmp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x0a
sbb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x69
das</pre>
<p>This snippet converts a nibble (4 bits) into a hex digit with only three instructions. It always takes me a few mintues to understand how it works. From what I know the <code>das</code>​ instruction doesn't work anymore on the x86_64 architecture, but it is a nice reminder of what life used to be.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How is this accomplished in three assembly instructions? Where is the conversion happening, and how is the 0x0a value used? The author has provided a complete explanation of the code below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code converts a hex number (0x0 ... 0xf) into a hex character<br>('0','1','2',...'9','a',...'f').</p>
<p>How it works<br>============</p>
<p>introduction:</p>
<p>This is the relevant part of the ASCII table:</p>
<pre>0x30 0
0x31 1
0x32 2
0x33 3
0x34 4
0x35 5
0x36 6
0x37 7
0x38 8
0x39 9
0x3a :
0x3b ;
0x3c &lt;
0x3d =
0x3e &gt;
0x3f ?
0x40 @
0x41 A
0x42 B
0x43 C
0x44 D ...</pre>
<p>There is an unfortunate gap between the numeric digits and the caps English<br>letters. The code above is meant to overcome that gap.</p>
<p>We want to map a number x to its relevant ASCII number, in the following<br>fashion: If 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 9, then map x to x + 0x30 If 0xa &lt;= x &lt;= 0xf, then map<br>x to x + 0x37</p>
<p>Note that the difference is 0x7. The idea for the code comes from the fact<br>that 7 = (16 - 10) + 1 We get the (16 - 10) difference from the DAS<br>instruction, and the 1 difference from the SBB and CMP instructions.</p>
<p>Intro to binary coded arithmetic<br>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Most of the magic of this snippet comes from the `das` instruction, so we<br>better start by exploring what it does.</p>
<p>`das` means decimal adjust (al) after subtraction. Together with the rest of<br>the binary coded decimals instructions family, it allows us to perform binary<br>coded decimals arithemtic.</p>
<p>Binary coded decimals are decimal numbers represented in base 16. For<br>example, 0x16 would mean the decimal number 16.</p>
<p>Internally, the `das` instruction observes the flag register, and alters `al`<br>to represent the correct binary coded decimal.</p>
<p>Subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
sub al, 0x08
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x23. Interpreted in the world of decimals, 31 - 8 = 23.<br>Overflow will also happen in the world of decimals (Modulo 100).</p>
<p>Overflow example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x15
sub al, 0x16
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x99, because 15 - 16 = -1, which equals to 99 modulo<br>100.</p>
<p>And finally, an example equivalent to the first subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x92
daa</pre>
<p>Which will also result in al = 0x23. This time we add instead of subtract.<br>and we use the instruction `daa`, decimal adjust after addition, instead of<br>`das`.</p>
<p>There is one more delicate point about `das` and `daa` that we will need for<br>our solution. Take a look at this example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x0a
daa</pre>
<p>The result is al = 0x41. This means that from the point of view of `daa`,<br>0x0a and 0x10 are the same. It also means that 0x0f behaves just like 0x15.</p>
<p>Converting to hex<br>------------------------</p>
<p>We want to use the 16 - 10 difference to our advantage, somehow bridging the <br>gap between the '9' and 'A' characters.</p>
<p>Here is a first attempt that is close to what we want to achieve:</p>
<pre>add al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>For every digit between '0' and '9', we will get the correct result.<br>As an example, assigning al = 0x5 will give us the result of al = 0x35, which<br>is the digit '5'. Assigning al = 0x9 will give us the result of al = 0x39.</p>
<p>What about hex digits? When we try to assign al = 0xa, we will get al = 0x40,<br>which means that we missed our target by 1. The character 'A' has the ASCII<br>code 0x41. But we did achieve something interesting here. We managed to take<br>a jump from 0x9 -&gt; 0x39 to 0xa -&gt; 0x40. Our input increased by 1, but our<br>output increased by 7!</p>
<p>We need to somehow add 1 in the case hex digits 'a' - 'f', but not in the<br>case of '0' - '9'. A classic way to achieve this is using the carry flag.<br>Here is a fixed solution:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa ; Check if al is an 'a' - 'f' digit
cmc ; Complement the carry
adc al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>So, if we have a numeric digit ('0' - '9') in al, the first two <br>instructions will have no effect. But if our digit is in the 'a' - 'f' range,<br>we will get a carry flag equals 1, and so `adc al, 0x30` is equivalent to<br>`add al, 0x31`. Hence for example, an input of al = 0xa will give an al =<br>0x41 output, as we wanted.</p>
<p>But we could make our code shorter if we could somehow avoid using `cmc`.<br>In order to do this, we could turn to the dual side, knowing that given<br>wraparound, subtraction is equivalent to addition. In other words, <br>`add al, 0x30 // daa` is equivalent to `sub al, 0x70 // das`.</p>
<p>Combining this with the carry flag trick, we finally get:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa
sbb al, 0x69
das</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives an idea of how much is packed into these short programs, but don't count on explanations for the other pieces. While the code may have seemed daunting early on, it has been intriguing enough for the book to build an audience slowly over the years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When "xchg rax, rax" was released in 2014, there was no real interest in the book. I hate marketing work, so I never really did anything to attempt to market the book. It is only recently, 6 years later, that people started paying attention.</p>

        <p>I use a variation of Conti and Caroland (2011)’s “memorize the first 100 digits of pi”
assignment as an in-class learning activity to teach my infosec students how to
cheat, as part of teaching threat modeling. This semester at the beginning was
all-remote for me, though, so I modified it for the zoom teaching session. Instead
of having all students write down the first 100 digits of pi and then submit
their papers to me, I instead told students the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your assignment is to memorize the first 100 digits of pi having been intentionally given so little time to do so that your only chance of
completing the assignment is to cheat. I authorize you to cheat on this assignment and only this assignment, but if I catch you cheating,
you lose.</p>

  <p>It will go something like this (subject to change): at the start of the next class, I will randomly sort the class roster, and then I will
go down the list and call on people one at a time to recite to me the first 100 digits of pi. I may ask you to share your screen, and also
to pan your camera about the room (be prepared!), simulating what proctor-monitoring software would do. The grading is pass/fail.
If we run out of time before you are called on, you pass by default.</p>

  <p>Again, I expect you to cheat. How you choose to cheat is entirely up to you. Collaborative cheating is also encouraged, but everyone
involved will lose the game if caught. At the completion, I will give you opportunities to share-and-tell your cheating techniques with
the class.</p>

  <p>The objective of the exercise is to learn how an adversary thinks and operates by deliberately loosening traditional rules and tapping
personal creativity. It is an exercise in threat modeling.</p>

  <p>I am only permitting you to cheat on this single quiz. You may not cheat on any other assignments for this class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was really fun. Nearly all pressure was off because I changed the language to
say that they would “lose” instead of “fail” if they got caught. In practice,
everyone who made a legitimate good-faith effort “passed.” If they made a legitimate
attempt. When we did it, I invited all other students
to help me try to catch the presenter cheating. They would submit suspicions via
zoom chat. I would interrupt the recitation if I suspected cheating, and sometimes
I asked them to do random challenges such as turn around and continue reciting the numbers,
or re-pan their camera to a certain position in the room. After I announced a pass or
lose, I asked each student to explain their technique, and we discussed. This
interstitial kept engagement high, I think.</p>

<p>Some students still passed. One had taped the numbers in three different places around
the room, anticipating that I might ask her to turn around. Another had taped
the numbers to the back of his laptop, <em>printed in reverse</em>, and had mirrors set
up in several places around the room. One student had an extra pair of earbuds on
under his over-the-ear phones, and had a button on his phone that would play a
recording of the numbers to him. Another student pre-recorded a video of himself
reciting the numbers, which obviously didn’t work well at all with interruptions,
but was still fun.</p>

<p>Pandemic be darned, still gonna have fun and teach things that will get me in trouble!</p>

<p>G. Conti and J. Caroland, “Embracing the Kobayashi Maru: Why You Should Teach Your Students to Cheat,” in IEEE Security &amp; Privacy, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. 48-51, July-Aug. 2011, doi: 10.1109/MSP.2011.80.</p>

      <p>I'm seeing a lot of disappointment about the speed of Ruby 3 out there. I think there are a lot of reasons for that, and I think they're worth looking at.</p>

<p>So: why wasn't Ruby 3 faster? Did it break its promise? (Spoiler: <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so</a>, but I understand why some people do.)</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>First: Faster Than What?</h2>

<p>I think some of the problem was misplaced expectations. People didn't understand what <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-3-by-3">"three times faster"</a> was supposed to mean. I don't think people thought it through, but I also don't think it was communicated very clearly.</p>

<p>So: some people understood what was promised, and some people didn't.</p>

<p>What was promised?</p>

<p>Matz, Ruby's creator and designer, has said many times "Ruby 3 will be three times faster compared to Ruby 2." When he was talking to Ruby implementors, that was clarified as "compared to Ruby 2.0.0 on the day it was released." But it would be easy for a random person to think that meant "compared to Ruby 2 right now." By the time Matz declared that goal there were already a few minor releases of Ruby 2 out there, which increased the speed. And by the time most people had heard about it, Ruby 2.4 was already released.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.4 is already a lot faster than Ruby 2.0. Most of the speed gain from Ruby 2.0 to 3.0 was already there by Ruby 2.4. Which means if you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were pretty darn disappointed. Ruby 3 is maybe 15%-25% faster than Ruby 2.4? But clearly not even 1.5x the speed, except for certain very specific cases with JIT.</p>

<p>If you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were probably very disappointed indeed.</p>

<h2>Aspirational Goals</h2>

<p>Early on, when he was first declaring Ruby 3, Matz described it as an aspirational goal. It was intentionally a stretch. I'm pretty happy with how it came out, but... There's a problem with loud, public stretch goals. They can annoy people who otherwise like you, and for good reason.</p>

<p>I feel like I can <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">argue with a straight face</a> that Ruby succeeded in that goal, within limits and with footnotes.</p>

<p>But let's be clear: nobody thought that literally every program written with Ruby would be three times faster. In fact, that's completely impossible. Let's talk about why.</p>

<h2>Making Ruby Faster Can Only Make Ruby Faster</h2>

<p>Making <strong><em>anything</em></strong> "X times faster" or "Y percent faster" is at best an oversimplification. That's just not how software works. For an extreme case, think about a script that just sleeps for ten seconds. It's kind of the canonical example where you literally <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> make it faster. At least, not without breaking it.</p>

<p>When we say "make Ruby three times faster" we have to have a long list of caveats in mind, even if we don't say them. A script that queries the database can only get so much faster because it's waiting on the database. Ruby programs that use C extensions have to wait on the C extensions — speeding up Ruby won't, generally speaking, speed up those C extensions.</p>

<p>You can't turn Ruby into magic fairy dust where having your Java program call out to a short Ruby script speeds up your Java by 10%. Ruby can only speed up the part that's calculated in Ruby.</p>

<p>That's hard. </p>

<p>There's an old <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2016/presentations/MattStudies.html">Matt Gaudet talk from RubyKaigi</a> where he talks about how we should measure 3x. We didn't wind up with that full array of benchmarks, but all his ideas are basically good for measuring. And if we had built all of them, we'd discover that they didn't all speed up by the same amount.</p>

<p>How could they? "Three times faster" is, by its nature, a bit of an abstraction and kind of inexact. What workload <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> is going to be three times faster?</p>

<h2>Incremental Changes, Disruptive Changes</h2>

<pre>    “How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”
    - Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises
</pre>

<p>Here's a thing: a lot of speedups are incremental. They take some common operation and they make it a little bit faster. It's often a tradeoff: one or more uncommon operations gets a little bit slower. By figuring out new tradeoffs or by carefully measuring which operations are common, you can slightly fine-tune and get a better result.</p>

<p>Ruby has done a lot of this. The core Ruby VM has mostly worked the same way since Ruby 1.9, with a lot of great polish and fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Here's a different thing: many speedups are disruptive instead of incremental. Ruby 1.9 rewrote the VM completely, but took several versions to get stable enough to use. There's a reason almost nobody deployed their production app on Ruby 1.9.1. Ruby 1.9 also made threading work better — and Ruby on Rails took ages to get to where that really worked for most people. We needed new app servers to take advantage of it. And most existing Rails apps needed to find out where they were doing thread-incompatible things and fix that.</p>

<p>Disruptive changes tend to be bigger speedups. But they also require a lot more work.</p>

<p>If you don't change any of your code from Ruby 1.9.3, it will still run on Ruby 3. In fact, it will run significantly better than on Ruby 1.9.3. It's faster, it crashes less often, it will catch more of your bugs. Those incremental changes will give you a significant speedup — say to around double the speed of 1.9.3 on the same hardware. That's not bad.</p>

<p>But you can do better than that. We have <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">much better evented libraries</a> in Ruby than existed in 1.9.3. We have <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">faster application servers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap">faster Rails boot time</a> and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">better Rails security</a>. All of these require some amount of changing your code or your process around your application. They are <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes, either a little bit disruptive (upgrade to Rails 6 from Rails 3) or very disruptive (switch to Async from non-evented code.)</p>

<p>Ruby 3 has several interesting <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes that will only help you if you use them. And using them may take some work.</p>

<h2>Ruby 3's Disruptive Changes</h2>

<p>One disruptive change is MJIT. You have to turn it on using the command line or an environment variable. It favours short methods and shallow call stacks. It works far better with plain Ruby code than with C extensions.</p>

<p>All of these are changes in the code or the configuration.</p>

<p>Over time I think you'll see more gems adapt to MJIT. There will be cases where the authors say, "if you want maximum performance, use the no-C-extensions version of the gem and turn on MJIT or use JRuby/TruffleRuby." JRuby and TruffleRuby already have JIT, you see, and so they have the same surprising property that Ruby code starts performing better <strong><em>without</em></strong> C extensions.</p>

<p>But we don't live in that world yet. Right now it's easier to skip using JIT and ignore it. And then you don't get the benefit of it, partly because you're waiting on other people.</p>

<p>And so MJIT is a change to speed up Ruby, but the benefits aren't here yet. They need time and work before they arrive. Ruby's MJIT was written incredibly quickly, and the stability was shockingly good. The flip side is that there are a lot of useful optimisations that got lost in the shuffle, and a lot of code that hasn't yet been rewritten to use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/performance/how-fast-are-ractors.html">Ractors</a> are the same. Eventually they'll make highly-parallel Ruby code run a lot faster. But you're going to need to learn them deeply, or wait for gem and framework authors to do it for you. Frankly they're also going to need more work in Ruby core before they're fast enough.</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13618">Autofibers</a>? Yup, same thing. I think those may be the most extreme case of needing big supporting changes, so we'll see if it happens. But they also have a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of potential to improve Ruby concurrency, especially when combined with Ractors. They'll also require a significant rewrite of a lot of your concurrency code to work well.</p>

<p>I think we'll also see type-based optimisations in at least some of Ruby. Now that we're tracking places where, say, we know an integer will always be used, it becomes easier to do a few TruffleRuby-style optimisations to hardcode integer operations. But that's going to take even longer.</p>

<h2>Did It Basically Fail, Then?</h2>

<p>I think we'll see the public perception that it failed.</p>

<p>More specifically: I can argue, <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">and I have argued</a>, that Ruby 3 succeeded at being three times faster than Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>But people were thinking the promise meant "three times faster than Ruby 2.4" and that's a significantly higher bar, one that Ruby 3 <strong><em>does not</em></strong> clear. It was never actually promised, but it's clearly a common public perception.</p>

<p>Most people want to know "will it run my code three times faster?" They not only mean "three times faster than what I'm using now," they also mean with no code changes. And so for most people asking that question, the disruptive changes are probably not useful or relevant.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.0.0 was about eight years ago. With the older and newer disruptive changes, it's actually not hard for the Ruby app you run now to run three times faster than what you were running eight years ago. Puma is <strong><em>good</em></strong>. Bootsnap made bootup much faster. Ruby itself, of course, is significantly better. But a lot of these changes are going to be seen as "not really Ruby changes." Disruptive improvements are like that.</p>

<p>And the most recent disruptive changes are going to take years to bear fruit. Indeed, some of them never will — Autofibers and Ractors, for instance, both have a significant chance of failing, long-term. There may never be any significant type-aware optimisations (or there may be.) I think at least one of those features will do well, and I'm certain at least one of them will basically fail. I just don't know which is which.</p>

<h2>But Did It Fail?</h2>

<p>I don't think it failed. As an aspirational goal, it was a challenge, a bar to try to reach. And I think Ruby <strong><em>did</em></strong> reach that bar. Ruby 3.0 is a lot faster than Ruby 2.0, with both incremental tuning and interesting new disruptive changes. "Three times faster" is hard to define, but <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I think it's fair to say it did it</a>.</p>

<p>I think that on its own terms, it succeeded.</p>

<p>I also think that speed isn't a major factor slowing down Ruby adoption. Most people who use …</p></section></div>

<p>[<a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerDailey/status/1359692177090236420">Update:</a> Users can’t reproduce this any longer, as they have pushed a server-side fix for this issue. It still counts as an embarrassing failure by Google. If you would like to see what the bug looked like, there’s a video at the bottom of the article.]</p>



<p>Amid Apple pushing mandatory privacy labels, Google is stalling on releasing updates for its iOS apps. Yet Google itself is now telling users that their own apps are out of date.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="1242" height="2208" src="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434.jpeg 1242w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-169x300.jpeg 169w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-576x1024.jpeg 576w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-768x1365.jpeg 768w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-864x1536.jpeg 864w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-1152x2048.jpeg 1152w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-982x1746.jpeg 982w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-225x400.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px"><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="1334" src="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086.png" alt="" srcset="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086.png 750w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086-169x300.png 169w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086-576x1024.png 576w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086-225x400.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"> </p>



<p><em>I verified that this warning is showing up for multiple apps (Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Maps). Multiple iPhones on iOS 14.4, owned by separate account holders, were tested. </em></p>



<p>About an hour ago, I opened my Gmail app to find that some of my accounts had been logged out. When I tried logging back in, Google informed me that “This app is out of date.” <em>Indeed! </em></p>



<p>Google has not pushed updates to their flagship apps including Gmail and Google Maps since before a Dec. 8 deadline, imposed by Apple, that mandated all app updates include new privacy labels. The “nutrition labels” describe<strong> </strong>to users all the ways developers collect data about them, which has been awkward for companies like Facebook, whose business model relies on the company knowing as much about its users as possible. Tweets have <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418">gone viral</a> for simply scrolling through the long privacy label section for apps like Facebook. It must be noted that in the past 6 weeks, Facebook’s rivals (especially <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210112/p32#a210112p32">Signal and Telegram</a>) have had success thanks to users’ privacy concerns, at an unprecedented scale.  Other companies hoping to avoid such shame have allegedly <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210129/p6#a210129p6">misled users about their collection practices</a>.  </p>



<p>Alphabet/Google has taken a third approach, which is to indefinitely stall on pushing updates to its iOS apps. But the company itself tried to downplay this popular theory. On Jan. 5, it claimed it would add Apple’s privacy labels to its apps <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210127/p22#a210127p22">“this week or the next week”</a>.  As Macrumors noted, some of its apps like YouTube <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/">have quietly received updates,</a> but not Chrome, Maps, Photos, Drive, Calendar, or Gmail, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">unusual</a>. While Google stalls on pushing updates to its apps, it’s notable that its rivals like Apple Maps, are continuing to innovate <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+maps+ios+update&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis0eqlueDuAhUGna0KHTSVDJsQ_AUoAXoECBUQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=796&amp;dpr=2">with new features in their apps</a>. Google has also been facing rivals that, like Facebook’s rivals, have been having unprecedented levels of success over privacy issues, namely DuckDuckGo, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210117/p1#a210117p1">which surpassed 100M daily search queries for the first time on Jan. 11</a>. Privacy is “in” these days.</p>



<p>After saying “This app is out of date”, its warning goes on to say “You should update this app.” <em>We can’t.</em> “The version you’re using doesn’t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.” <em>Let’s hope that’s not true! </em>If you visit the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480">Gmail app’s page</a> directly, you will see its last update was released on Dec. 1. </p>



<p>Presumably, the warning is triggered by an automatic check of how long it has been since the app was last updated. In this case, it’s been over 2 months. But only Google can resolve that situation. Here’s a video of Google’s warning being triggered:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Google itself is now telling users their apps are out of date, despite no updates being available" width="663" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rt4ftLVVDQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Looking at the bigger picture: If Google really decided to intentionally delay updating its apps over adding privacy labels, it’s honestly hard to believe that such short-term thinking prevails in its leadership. They inevitably put themselves in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand-effect</a> situation, where in the end they’d attract more attention to themselves. Whereas if they had published early, the media’s attention would have been split across all of Big Tech’s apps. While the alleged decision itself was always doomed to end poorly, this “app out of date” interstitial is just an epic self own. I guess the decision to delay apps was not handled well internally, because such choices are probably uncommon and the processes to carry them out aren’t as battle-tested or familiar. John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/10/dailey-google-ios-apps">posited</a> that perhaps Google is attempting to “wait Apple out — that public pressure from iPhone owners who use Google apps will result in Apple conceding to better terms for what Google needs to admit to in its nutrition labels. I don’t see that working.” I don’t either.</p>



<p>There is also a chance that Google is trying to do a cleanup of their back end — removing some data collection from ads systems — before publishing privacy labels.  I really like (and want to believe) this angle, however unlikely, because it would show that Apple’s privacy labels are having a powerful pro-consumer effect on major app developers. </p>



<p>On the matter of <em>if </em>Google is really delaying its apps over concerns about privacy labels: they really <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">want us to believe that’s not the reason</a>, telling Techcrunch that the labels would start rolling out last month. Yet, that did not happen with the lion’s share of its apps. Take a minute to check out this stunning visualization, which illustrates the frequency of its apps’ updates before and after the December 8 privacy label deadline (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596/photo/1">@thomasbcn</a>):</p>

<p>From this blunt visual, one can not only assume that the lack of updates are related to the privacy label deadline, but that most of its apps are in need of bug fixes and aren’t receiving those updates.</p>



<p>I guess we’ll wait and see what happens… </p>

<p><em>(There’s a possibility that as I push publish on this post, Google is mid-update on a global rollout of fresh updates for its flagship apps. But I think that chance is slim, as Apple’s “Phased Release” option lets users immediately receive app updates if they visit an app’s store page directly.) </em> </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	            <p>This is a follow-up to <a href="https://github.com/stefwalter/blog/pull/1">the open-source-as-a-service blog
post</a> of a friend and a colleague of
mine, <a href="https://github.com/stefwalter">Stef Walter</a>.</p>

<p>TL;DR of Stef’s article is that open source services are hard to contribute to.
Any first-time contributor is probably having hard times to try changes locally
in the same way the service is deployed in production.</p>

<p>Imagine that you’d be able to contribute to GitHub and try your change in some
playground moments later you opened your PR. Freakin’ awesome, right?! I
strongly advise you to read Stef’s blog post to understand this concept further.</p>

<p>In this article I’d like to discuss the practical side of this - how can one
actually achieve such glorious service contribution model?</p>



<p>Please don’t expect to get an end-to-end guide here - that would take a book to
write, instead I intend to give you a few advices how to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-even-start">How do I even start?</h2>

<p>The beginning of your journey should be to set goals: clearly define your
milestones (ideally with acceptance criteria) and start working towards that
goal.</p>

<p>Stef already wrote <a href="https://github.com/stefwalter/stefwalter.github.io/blob/main/playbook.md">a list of well-defined
stages</a>
which you can embrace on your journey. It means that our end-goal then is:</p>

<pre><code>All changes proposed against project's repositories are deployed to a
playground where contributors can try them out.
</code></pre>

<p>One note here is that certain milestones can have requirements: you may state
that a certain container engine needs to be available to achieve a milestone.</p>

<h2 id="asking-again-how-do-i-start">Asking again: how do I start?</h2>

<p>10 stages, sounds pretty intimidating. The technology that helped us to move up
the ladder was <a href="https://openshift.com/">containers and OpenShift</a>. That’s what
the stage 3 is about - be able to build container images of your service no
matter the developer’s OS and deploy them into k8s or OpenShift.</p>



<p>Containers and OpenShift are clear at this point and that should narrow our
scope.</p>

<p>The next main tool which will help you is… Automation!</p>

<p>If you need to do manual steps to achieve parts of the development workflow,
it’s just a burden which is holding you back to progress further. The
automation doesn’t need to be perfect - in fact, it will never be, just make
sure it’s implemented, you can always improve it with spending further
development cycles on it once you are aware of the main drawbacks.</p>

<p>Actual tooling? Whatever fits you and your team: e.g. we are using
<a href="https://ansible.com/">Ansible</a> to achieve most of the automation paired with
<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/nodes/jobs/nodes-nodes-jobs.html">OpenShift
Jobs</a>
and expanding into <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub
actions</a>.</p>

<p>Some (Red Hat) teams are using <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/">Argo CD</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tektoncd">Tekton</a> and <a href="https://kustomize.io/">Kustomize</a>.
Make sure to do your research and pick tooling which is best for your use
cases.</p>

<p>The principle remains the same though: use continuous integration to verify the
change passes automated tests and continuous delivery for users and developers
to try the change before (or after) it’s merged with as little disruption in
production as possible.</p>

<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>

<p>This is really hard. We already did <a href="https://github.com/packit/research/tree/main/deploy-packit-pr">an
analysis</a> how to
achieve this contribution model for our project, <a href="https://packit.dev/">packit</a>,
and the task list is pretty long. On the other hand, the payoff is
mind-blowing: anyone can open a PR against a repo in our project and be able
to play with it once it’s deployed - without even knowing how to deploy our
service. I would use it all the time when working on our project.</p>

<p>Happy hacking and best of luck!</p>

    <p>Open Sourcing the code to your SaaS is insufficient to make it
actually be Open Source. Sounds&nbsp;self-contradictory?</p>
<p>Most services that espouse “Open Source”, do so by simply
<a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci">throwing the code over the wall</a>.
It’s better than nothing, but really misses the point that powers
Open Source: enabling users to make a change to the software
they’re&nbsp;using.</p>
<p>Some other popular services powered by Open Source software, such as
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/development/">GitLab.com</a>
or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/free-and-open">ElasticSearch</a> do include
the tools used to operate/deploy their service. Pause for&nbsp;applause</p>
<p>👏👏👏</p>
<p>But that’s also insufficient to actually enable users to become
contributors&nbsp;effectively.</p>
<p>Much of the value of a service comes from things other than the code.
It comes from the infrastructure it runs on, the operational processes,
the monitoring, the backups, the metrics, the high availability, the
scalability. It comes from data, from the network effect, with other users,
with other interconnected services, with integrated tools, from legal
agreements, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Any non-toy Service is not&nbsp;reproducible.</p>
<p>Launching a clone of the service in order to effectively contribute
is a high barrier. Certain kinds of contributions clearly are possible.
But contributors are essentially asked to “fork” the above non-code
aspects of the service in order to iterate on their changes against
their real world use&nbsp;cases.</p>
<p>What’s more, without true Open Source principles, we are missing a
way to have a community develop with a center of gravity around
the service itself. This leads to companies
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch">forking the service</a>
in a way that typical open source projects with a true community
are resilient&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>I believe that if we enable contributions to services, <em>rather than just
the software</em>, we reap the advantages of true Open Source. That means
enabling users to make a change to a running service and experience
that change&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>You still with&nbsp;me?</p>
<p>Yes, that means opening a pull request against a running service
and experiencing that change before it’s&nbsp;merged.</p>
<p>This is not as insane as it&nbsp;sounds.</p>
<p>It appears that every technique we need to enable such a capability
is already in use in modern deployment and operations methodology.
We just have to connect the&nbsp;dots.</p>

<p>I’ve been a part of Open Source for over 20 years now. Although I’m
just one contributor, together we’ve changed something fundamental
about the world. Our lives are too short, and software too complex,
to have one company or one individual invent everything from scratch.
So we work together across humanity to accomplish what no
individual team could. This is our legacy, and it has become
common&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>And yet there’s a very simple principle that drives Open&nbsp;Source:</p>
<p>
Open Source thrives when it converts some<br>small percentage of users into contributors.
</p>

<p>If you interrupt that principle, you starve Open Source. Software as a
Service does just that: When someone else runs software for you, the
intuitive mechanisms for users to change that software are&nbsp;unavailable.</p>
<p><img alt="How users become contributors" src="http://stef.thewalter.net/images/funneling-open-source-service.png"></p>
<p><span>“</span>But” you may say, “If the source code for that running service was <strong>open</strong>
then I could still change&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>Sure you could change the code in some component, but for any reasonably
complex Service you wouldn’t be able to run your changes, experience your
changes against real world workflows, much less iterate on them until
they’re good enough to share with&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>In reality the threat here is far more fundamental: Users of services
cannot readily change something in the service not only because the
processes are operated by someone else … but because such users of
a service have explicitly chosen not to be involved in operating
the&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>If the primary way to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Postgres was “as a Service”</a>,
then that (fabulous) project would be starved for contributors. This is
because the number of contributors in a such a project are a function
of some small percentage of users deciding to try to make&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>As this mechanism for using software, as a service, takes over the world
the pool of users who can contribute to Open Source shrinks&nbsp;dramatically.</p>
<p>For a long time I saw this as a fundamental threat that would starve
Open Source. I was unable reconcile Software as a Service with a healthy
Open Source&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p>But recently, I’ve become convinced that if we enable an effective
contribution model on a service, one that doesn’t require that the users
themselves become operators of the service … then we can reconcile this
threat and Open Source will thrive on services instead of be starved by&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>To enable contributions by users of a service, users that have explicitly
chosen not to operate the software themselves, we have to set up a process
by which they can make a change to a running service and experience that
change themselves before others&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>For example, a user of such a hypothetical service should be able&nbsp;to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Discover which component of a service to contribute&nbsp;to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a non-sensical change (like add a printf style log statement) or change the spelling of a&nbsp;word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience that change when they use the service, or when it acts on their&nbsp;data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After discussing this with others, I firmly believe we have all the techniques we need,
whether canary deployments, load balancing, continuous delivery,
infrastructure as code, and so on. It’s been hard to find a single
problem that an existing practice doesn’t&nbsp;solve.</p>
<p>It turns out many experienced engineering teams have come to that same
conclusion. Rapid deployment of changes to services is a powerful
capability highly sought after. For example,
<a href="https://github.blog/2015-06-02-deploying-branches-to-github-com/">GitHub deploys changes before they’re merged</a>.
Whereas
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2017/08/31/web/rapid-release-at-massive-scale/">Facebook rapidly deploys changes</a>
to a few canary machines and scales each change up to production.
Everyone has their own version of continuous delivery. It’s hard to
take an engineering team seriously if they haven’t figured out how
their team members can get a change rapidly&nbsp;deployed.</p>
<p>As Open Source, we have all the ingredients to have a decisive
advantage here. To effectively collaborate on  <strong>Open Source Services</strong>,
contributors across&nbsp;humanity.</p>
<p>Lets try to craft a playbook to achieve this basic capability
that drives Open Source Software and apply it to Open Source Services:
The ability to change code and interact with that change … on a&nbsp;service.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Today, I looked up how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">floating point operations per second</a> (FLOPS) that an iPhone can do. It turns out the A14 chip in the iPhone <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/10/15/apple-claims-the-iphone-12s-a14-bionic-challenges-laptops-but-gives-no-details/">can do about 11 TFlOPS according to Apple</a>. Let's give Apple the benefits of the doubt and not get too deep into how they got that number, and put it to perspective and compare the iPhone with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_supercomputing">Top 500 Supercomputers</a> in the world over the years:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/iphone-vs-supercomputers.png" alt="iPhone vs Supercomputers"></p>
<p>The green line is how much computing power that little phone I'm holding in my hands has. If released in 2009, it would have made it to the list of top 500 supercomputers in the world! It has more computing power than the most powerful computer in the world in 2002. It has the combined computing power of the 1997's top 500 supercomputers in the whole world.</p>
<p>People talked about how the computer on Appolo was so slow. I get it, but I can hardly relate to that. I wasn't born then. However, 2009 was just 12 years ago. I could still remember it vividly. I was a freshman student then.</p>
<p>Reflecting on that, I figured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something with the form factor and power envelope of the phone alone is already exceedingly powerful. It could potentially do things that humankind couldn't achieve just ten years ago.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I don't need to have the most whizz-bang computer or phone to make programs that do amazing things. Writing programs for older hardware can be a pleasure. Supporting older hardware makes programs I create more accessible to a larger part of the human population.</li>
<li>As a programmer, when I complain about the phone or any computer I have is not powerful enough for whatever I want to do, it's much more likely it's me doing something wrong.</li>
<li>The world changes faster than my mind conceives. I need to be humble about what I know. Things I know to be fast becomes slow sooner than I expect. In the same realm, maybe ideas that I know to be good become bad sooner than I expect. Those ideas are not necessarily limited to technology: Maybe ideas in science, humanities, and society also envolve that way. It is just harder to put into numbers like TFLOPS.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have the most power computer in our pocket. Doing something amazing with that power should constantly be a question on our mind. All that power just to push one more ads is a fucking stupid and disgusting idea.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases are wonderful, awful things. I've spent years referencing various resources with lists of biases, whilst going through information collected in <a href="https://hirund.in/tools/research">ethnographic research</a>. Wikipedia has a good list, but it's not the easiest thing to go use. There's a few other tools out there which do similar things, but none geared up specifically for researchers which have entirely worked for my needs. So at the risk of creating the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">15th competing standard</a>, I thought I'd take some time, go through all the ones I like, and assemble something which worked for me.</p>
<p>Hopefully you'll find it useful too!</p>

<p>You have to walk before you can run! Start your journey here in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/syntax">part 1</a>, where we'll learn the basics of Rust's syntax.</p>

<p>One of the things that distinguishes Rust from Haskell is the way it handles memory. Rust is meant to be more performant than Haskell, so it forces us to think more about memory while we're programming. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/memory">part 2</a> of the series, we'll see what this looks like.</p>

<p>Data types are one area where Rust borrows some great ideas from Haskell! Take a look at <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/data">part 3</a> to learn more!</p>

<p>Like any good language, Rust comes with a development toolchain for package management and dependency handling. Cargo is very much Rust's equivalent to Stack. And in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/cargo">part 4</a>, we'll see how to use it.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/lifetimes">fifth and final part</a> of this series, we'll explore a couple more topics that will round out your Rust eduction. We'll first see how to use collection types in Rust. Then we'll see some of the implications of Rust's memory model on these types. This will lead us to an exploration of the concept of lifetimes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it helps to see things in action, rather than just reading about them! In our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust-video-tutorial">Rust video tutorial</a>, we'll go through all the concepts from this series from scratch, starting with installation! You'll get to see specific examples, and what a general development flow looks like.</p>

<p>After having it on my to-do list for several years, I finally got around to trying out a <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">static site generator</a> (SSG). In particular, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I decided to take Hugo for a spin, by rebuilding one of my golden oldies, <a href="https://worldtrip.greenash.net.au/">Jaza's World Trip</a>, with it. And, for bonus points, I <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip">published the source code</a> on GitHub, and I deployed the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Hugo is <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">great software</a> with a <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/">great community</a>, however it didn't quite live up to my expectations.
</p>
<p><img src="https://greenash.net.au/media/cache/12/40/124097ee0b5f0c78d99619f81b301f92.jpg" width="720" height="254" alt="Hugo: fast like a... gopher?"></p><p><em>Hugo: fast like a... gopher?</em></p>
<p><em>Image source:</em> <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
</p>
<h2>Memory lane</h2>
<p>To give you a bit of history: worldtrip was originally built in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> (version <a href="https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/news-and-announcements/2006-05-01/drupal-470-released">4.7</a>), back in 2007. So it started its life as a real, old-school, PHP CMS driven blog. I actually wrote most of the blog entries from internet cafés around the world, by logging in and typing away – often while struggling with a non-English keyboard, a bad internet connection, a sluggish machine, and a malware-infested old Windows. Ah, the memories! And people posted comments too.
</p>
<p>Then, in 2014, I converted it to a "static PHP site", which I custom-built. It was static as in "no database" – all the content <a href="https://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2014/05/database-free-content-tagging-with-files-and-glob/">was in flat files</a>, virtually identical to the "content files" of Hugo and other SSGs – but not quite static as in "plain HTML files". It was still PHP, and so it still needed to be served by a PHP-capable web server (like Apache or Nginx with their various modules).
</p>
<p>In retrospect, maybe I should have SSG-ified worldtrip in 2014. But SSGs still weren't much of a thing back then: Hugo was in its infancy; Netlify didn't exist yet; nor did any of the JS-based <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/">cool</a> new <a href="https://nextjs.org/">kids</a>. The original SSG, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, was around, but it wasn't really on my radar (I didn't try out Jekyll until around 2016, and I never ended up building or deploying a finished site with it). Plus I still wasn't quite ready to end my decade-long love affair with PHP (I finally got out of that toxic relationship for good, a few years later). Nor was I able to yet embrace the idea of hosting a whole web site on anything other than an old-school box: for a decade or so, all I had known was "shared hosting" and VPSes.
</p>
<h2>Hugo time</h2>
<p>So, it's 2021, and I've converted worldtrip yet again, this time to Hugo. It's pretty much unchanged on the surface. The main difference is that the trip photos (both in the "gallery" section, and embedded in blog posts) are now sourced from an S3 bucket instead of from Flickr (I needed to make this change in order to <a href="https://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2021/02/private-photo-collections-with-awspics/">retire my Flickr account</a>). I also converted the location map from a Google map to a Leaflet / Mapbox map (this was also needed, as <a href="https://www.endpoint.com/blog/2019/03/23/switching-google-maps-leaflet">Google now charges</a> for even the simplest Maps API usage). I could have made those changes without re-building the whole site, but they were a good excuse to do just that.
</p>

<p>True <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">to its word</a>, I can attest that Hugo is <a href="https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-vs-jekyll-benchmark/">indeed fast</a>. On my local machine, Hugo generates all of the 2,000+ pages of worldtrip in a little over 2 seconds. And deploying it on Netlify is indeed easy-peasy. And free – including with a custom domain, with SSL, with quite generous bandwidth, with plenty of build minutes – so kudos to Netlify (and I hope they keep on being so generous!).
</p>
<p>Hugo had pretty much everything I needed, to make re-building worldtrip a breeze: <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/types/">content types</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/">taxonomies</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/">menus</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/">customisable URLs</a>, templating (including <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/">partials</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/">shortcodes</a>), <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/pagination/">pagination</a>, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/variables/page/">previous / next</a> links. It didn't support absolutely all of worldtrip's features out-of-the-box – but then again, nothing ever does, right? And filling in those remaining gaps was going to be easy, right?
</p>
<p>As it turns out, building custom functionality in Hugo is quite hard.
</p>
<p>The first pain point that I hit, was worldtrip's multi-level (country / city) taxonomy hierarchy. Others have <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/multi-level-taxonomy/4888/15">shared their grief</a> with this, and I shared mine there too. I got it working, but only by coding way more logic into a template than should have been necessary, and by abusing the s%#$ out of Hugo templating's <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/scratch/">scratch</a> feature. The <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/partials/countriesandcities.html">resulting partial</a> template is an unreadable abomination. It could have been a nice, clean, testable function (and it previously was one, in PHP), were I able to write any actual code in a Hugo site (in Go or in any other language). But no, you can't write actual code in a Hugo site, you can only write template logic.
</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just discovered that <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/5783">support for <code>return</code>'ing a value</a> of any type (rather than just rendering a string) <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/5788">was added to Hugo</a> a few years back (and is documented, albeit rather tersely). So I could rely on Hugo's scratch a bit less, if I were to instead <code>return</code> the countries / cities array. But the logic still has to live in a template!
</p>
<p>Same with the tag cloud. It's not such a big deal, it's a problem that <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/weighted-tag-cloud/3491/10">various people have solved</a> at the template level, and I did so too. What I did for <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/partials/weightedtags.html">weighted tags</a> isn't totally illegible. But again, it was previously (pre-Hugo) implemented as a nice actual function in code, and now it's shoved into template logic.
</p>
<p><img src="https://greenash.net.au/media/cache/26/f0/26f0e19360b7f631f6fa6808b97f0fd9.jpg" width="720" height="374" alt="The weighted tag cloud."></p><p><em>The weighted tag cloud.</em></p>
<p>The photo gallery was cause for considerable grief too. Because I didn't want an individual page to be rendered for each photo, my first approach was to define the gallery items in <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/">data files</a>. But I needed the listing to be paginated, and I soon discovered that Hugo's pagination only supports page collections, not arbitrary lists of data (why?!). So, take two, I defined them as <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/">headless bundles</a>. But it just so happens that listing headless bundles (as opposed to just retrieving a single one) <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-iterate-over-headless-pages/12536/21">is a right pain</a>, and if you're building up a list of them and then paginating that list, it's also hacky and very inefficient (when I tried it, my site took 4x longer to build, because it was calling <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/readdir/"><code>readDir</code></a> on the whole photo directory, for each paginated chunk).
</p>
<p>Finally, I stumbled across Hugo's (quite new) <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/build-options/">"no render"</a> feature, and I was able to define and paginate my gallery items (without having a stand-alone page for each photo) in an efficient and non-hacky way, by specifying the build options <code>render = "never"</code> and <code>list = "local"</code>. I also fixed a bug in Hugo itself (my first tiny bit of code written in <a href="https://golang.org/">golang</a>!), to <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/8201">exclude "no render" pages from the sitemap</a> (as of writing, the fix has been merged but not included in a stable Hugo release), thus making it safe(r) to specify <code>list = "always"</code> (which you might need, instead of <code>list = "local"</code>, if you want to list your items anywhere else on the site, other than on their parent page). So, at least with the photo gallery – in contrast to my other above-mentioned Hugo pain points – I'm satisfied with the end result. Nevertheless, a more-than-warranted amount of hair tearing-out did occur.
</p>
<p>The worldtrip monthly archive wasn't particularly hard to implement, <a href="https://blog.atj.me/2017/10/generate-yearly-and-monthly-archive-pages-with-hugo-sections/">thanks to this guide</a> that I followed quite closely. But I was disappointed that I had to create a physical "page" content file for each month, in order for Hugo to render it. Because guess what, Hugo <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/pagination-and-group-by-date/1441/10">doesn't have built-in support</a> for chronological archive pages! And because, since Hugo offers <a href="https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-and-jekyll-compared/">no real mechanism</a> for you to write code anywhere to (programatically) render such pages, you just have to hack around that limitation. I didn't do what the author of that guide did (he added a stand-alone Node.js script to generate more archive "page" content files when needed), because worldtrip is a retired site that will never need more such pages generated, and because I'd rather avoid having totally-separate-to-Hugo build scripts like that. The <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/monthly-archive/single.html">monthly archive templates</a> also contain <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/blog/monthly-archive.html">more logic</a> than they ideally should.
</p>

<h2>Mixed feelings</h2>
<p>So, I succeeded in migrating worldtrip to Hugo. I can pat myself on the back, job well done, jolly good old chap. I don't regret having chosen Hugo: it really is fast; it's a well-written (to my novice golang eyes) and well-maintained open-source codebase; it boasts an active dev and support community; <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">its documentation</a> is of a high standard; and it comes built-in with 95% of the functionality that any static site could possibly need.
</p>
<p>I wanted, and I still want, to love Hugo, for those reasons. And just because it's golang (which I have vaguely been wanting to learn lately … although I have invested time in learning the basics of other languages over the past several years, namely Erlang and Rust). And because it really seems like the best-in-breed among SSGs: it's focused on the basics of HTML page generation (not trying to "solve React for static sites", or other such nonsense, at the same time); it takes performance and scalability seriously; and it fosters a good dev, design, and content authoring experience.
</p>
<p>However, it seems that, by design, it's completely impossible to write custom code in an actual programming language (not in a presentation-layer template), that's hooked in to Hugo in any way (apart from by hacking Hugo core). I don't mind that Hugo is opinionated. Many great pieces of software are opinionated – <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for example.
</p>
<p>But Django is far more flexible: you can programatically render any page, with <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/urls/">any URL</a>, that takes your fancy; you can move any presentational logic you want into procedural code (usually either in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/views/">view layer</a>, to populate template variables, or in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/custom-template-tags/">custom template tags</a>), to keep your templates simple; and you can <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/models/">model your data</a> however you want (so you're free to implement something like a multi-level taxonomy yourself – although I admit that this isn't a fair apples vs apples comparison, as Django data is stored in a database). I realise that Django – and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> – all generate dynamic sites; but that's no excuse, an SSG can and should allow the same level of flexibility via custom code.
</p>

            <p>This is a total break from my usual paleontology content, but bear with me, because I think this topic is really interesting, fun, and useful.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-bayess-theorem">Introduction to Bayes’s Theorem</h3>

<p>The Reverend Thomas Bayes was a rather obscure 18th-century Presbyterian minister who made a single, ridiculously important contribution to mathematics: Bayes’s Theorem.  This is a formula for calculating probabilities that takes into account <em>prior knowledge</em>, the things you already know or believe before you do the calculation.  Statisticians who use Bayes’s Theorem for their probability are called Bayesians, while statisticians who don’t are called frequentists.  Here’s a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1132/">relevant xkcd</a> highlighting the difference.</p>

<p>Bayes’s Theorem has important applications in machine learning, since it’s a way of formalizing the process of reasoning with uncertain information–essentially, getting computers to make good decisions even when they’re not totally sure about certain facts.  The theorem is also culturally important in the rationality community, so much so that to many people, “Bayesian” is synonymous with “rationalist”.</p>

<p>Despite all the hype, Bayes’s Theorem is actually pretty easy to reason about and apply to various real-life problems.  In this post, I’ll provide three examples of times I’ve used it in my own life, and hopefully by the end you’ll understand how to apply it to yours too.</p>

<h3 id="example-1-a-tea-party-with-bayes">Example 1: A Tea Party With Bayes</h3>

<p>At work, in the before-time, we used have a tea party every Tuesday from 6 to 6:30.  Before my company was bought by a larger company, it was a scotch party, where a bunch of middle-aged men would get together and taste the scotch of the week and try to guess what it was.  But the larger company has a no-alcohol-on-the-premises policy, so it became a tea party.  It’s kind of funny to see all these middle-aged men drinking tea and eating cookies and strawberries.  It seems a lot more like an old-woman thing to do.  Anyway, the game is that they’ll have some kind of plain tea–white, green, oolong, or black–and you have to guess which it is.  If you’re really good, you’ll also guess what form (leaves, stems, powdered, etc) and what region (China, India, etc) and if you think it’s been served at the tea party in the past.</p>

<p>All this to say I realized I was making an un-Bayesian mistake when guessing tea.  Let’s simplify it for now and just say there’s two kinds of tea, green and white.  And let’s say my tasting skill is not that great yet, so I can distinguish between the two with a 60/40 success rate.  So, 60% of green teas I taste will taste green to me, and 40% of green teas I’ll misidentify as white.  Same thing with white tea: 60% I’ll correctly identify as white, and 40% I’ll wrongly guess green.  One week, I tasted a tea, and it tasted white.  So, stupidly, I guessed white.  I was wrong.  This is stupid because I disregarded my priors.  White tea is way more rare than green, and I would estimate that for every white tea we have, we have nine green teas.  So the <strong>prior probability</strong> of tea being white is 10%.  Instead of <em>shifting</em> this probability when presented with new data, the 60/40 taste of it, I <em>replaced</em> my prior with the new number, and guessed it was 60% likely to be white tea.  However, using Bayes’s equation, the true probability is only 14%, because there are so few white teas to begin with!  Even if I could taste with 90% accuracy, the probability would only be 50% of being white tea.  Let me explain the math:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Out of 100 taste tests of tea, we can expect 90 of them to be green and 10 of them to be white.  Easy so far.</li>
  <li>Out of the 90 green teas, there will be 54 that taste green (60% of 90) and 36 that taste white (40% of 90).</li>
  <li>Out of the 10 white teas, there will be 6 that taste white and 4 that taste green.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if I want to know the probability of a tea <em>being</em> white given that it <em>tastes</em> white (written mathematically as P(white | tastes white)) you do this:</p><p>

\[P(\text{white} | \text{tastes white})=\frac{\text{number of white teas that taste white}}{\text{total number of teas that taste white}}\]

\[P(\text{white} | \text{tastes white})=\frac{6}{6+36}=14.3\%\]

</p><p>So you can see, the number of <strong>false positives</strong> I get from green teas that taste white is actually <em>larger</em> than the number of <em>true</em> positives, even though the false positives are a smaller proportion of the population.</p>

<p>Another way to visualize this calculation is to make a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Tea tastes white</td>
      <td>Tea tastes green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tea is white</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tea is green</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>64</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A presentation of data that shows the same relationships but looks different is called <strong>isomorphic</strong>.  This table is isomorphic to the bullet points above.</p>

<h3 id="example-2-taking-bayes-on-a-date">Example 2: Taking Bayes On A Date</h3>

<p>Here’s an example from a few years ago, when I was using Tinder, the speed-online-dating app.  I was scoring each suitor in a spreadsheet on a few different categories, like “Musicality” and “Open-Mindedness” and “Attractiveness.”  One time, I went on a date with a boy who got super high marks in all my predetermined categories; he was super smart, went to Harvard for undergrad and Oxford for grad, currently works at Facebook, knew a bit about rationality, had similar musical taste to me, was into climbing, played piano for 12 years, etc.  Basically he was getting 7-9 in every category.  <em>But</em> he seemed like he might be gay (and trying to date girls on Tinder because of familial pressure).  Because of that, I added a new “other” category and scored him low on it, but he still came out with a higher score than any previous candidate.  So then I decided to do a Bayesian calculation of how likely he was to be gay.</p>

<p>I’ve written about the fraternal birth order effect before in my post about <a href="https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/08/12/pregananant.html">strange biological phenomena related to pregnancy</a>.  For some reason, the more older brothers a right-handed man has, the more likely he is to be gay.  For some strange reason, it doesn’t affect women and it doesn’t affect left-handed men.  The prior probability of being gay (equivalent to the prevalence in the population) is about 3%.  For every older brother you have, the probability goes up by 1/3.</p>

<p><strong>STOP PRESS: I have since been informed that this equation is incorrect!  See both my original derivation and the corrected equation in the Appendices to this post.  However, this is what I used at the time, and this part isn’t part of the Bayesian calculation, so I’m leaving it as it was in this section.</strong></p>

<p>The equation can be expressed as follows:</p><p>

\[P_{gay}=1-\left(\frac{97}{100}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\right)\]

</p><p>Where <em>n</em> is the number of older brothers.  There’s an explanation of where this expression comes from at the end of this post, for those interested.</p>

<p>The suitor in question had one older brother.  So, his prior probability of being gay was:</p><p>

\[P_{gay}=1-\left(\frac{97}{100}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\right) = 35\%\]

</p><p>I would guess that my gay-dar has an accuracy of 70/30. So, using this information along with the 35% prior probability, we can calculate</p>
<ul>
  <li>Out of 1000 of this suitor,</li>
  <li>350 will be gay and 650 will be straight.</li>
  <li>Of the 350 gay, 245 will seem gay and 105 will seem straight.</li>
  <li>Of the 650 straight, 455 will seem straight and 195 will seem gay. So the probability of him being gay given he seems gay is</li>
</ul><p>

\[P(\text{gay} | \text{seems gay}) = \frac{245}{245+195} = 56\%\]

</p><p>So, even when taking into account the relatively small prior probability of being gay, I thought he was more likely to be gay than not, and I didn’t go on any more dates.</p>

<p>Again, we can represent the data isomorphically in a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Seems gay</td>
      <td>Seems straight</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is gay</td>
      <td>245</td>
      <td>105</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is straight</td>
      <td>195</td>
      <td>455</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Being able to draw up a table becomes important when reasoning about more than two variables, as we’ll see in the next section.</p>

<p>Note: you probably have noticed that half of my Bayesian calculation each time comes from making up a number: my tea tasting accuracy of 60/40 and my gay-dar accuracy of 70/30. The point of doing a Bayesian calculation is that it makes you consider your priors and make a real statistical calculation, but once you get the result, you can make the choice to throw out the answer and go with your gut. But by doing this, your gut is much better informed.</p>

<p>Another interesting place the fraternal birth order thing comes into play is in the movie Frozen, in which Prince Hans says that he has twelve older brothers. If you’ve seen the movie, you know that he courts Anna just so he can gain control of her kingdom, so his sexuality isn’t really revealed by the story. Using the fraternal birth order calculation, we find that he has a 99.3% chance of being gay. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Watsonianally</a>, if Anna had known about the fraternal birth order effect, she could have saved herself a lot of trouble.  <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Doylistically</a>, I wonder if Disney’s writers knew about the fraternal birth order effect and intentionally invoked it when creating Hans’s backstory, appearance, and mannerisms.</p>

<h3 id="example-3-bayes-in-the-time-of-covid">Example 3: Bayes In The Time Of COVID</h3>

<p>This example is from very recently, and is what inspired me to write this up as a post.  Here’s what happened.</p>

<p>I wanted to visit my parents in person for New Year, so I got a COVID test even though I didn’t know of any particular exposures or have any symptoms.  I had been going to work in person and had been to the doctor a couple times though, so I thought it would be prudent to get tested just in case.  Surprise surprise, the test came back positive (if it didn’t, why would I be telling you this story?), so I cancelled my New Year plans and locked myself in a bedroom for ten days.  However, I’d been living in the same house and sleeping in the same bed as my fiancé up until I received the test result, so for awhile we were worried that we would both get sick.</p>

<p>Thankfully, that didn’t happen: he tested negative twice (once maybe a bit early, but once in the theoretic peak detection time), and neither of us ever experienced any symptoms.  That made me think, is it more likely that my result was a false positive, or that I truly had COVID but somehow didn’t transmit it to him?  Time to …</p></div></div>

Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres. What are your thoughts on this tactic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I adore Babelfish because it keeps the pressure on Microsoft to continue innovating.&nbsp;The database market is kinda like this:</p><ul><li>Oracle – massively expensive</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server – pretty doggone expensive</li><li>AWS RDS Postgres and Aurora – inexpensive to mildly expensive</li><li>Postgres – free to inexpensive, depending on support</li></ul><p>If you’re Microsoft, and you wanna make more money, you look at Oracle’s pile of cash, and you build features that will help Oracle users migrate down to SQL Server and save money. If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition. Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

	<div>
		<div>
			<p>When you surf the net, you are constantly sharing data that belongs to you and holds a value.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, every time you use an APP or visit any website, valuable information is being compiled about you, your tastes, purchasing behaviour, lifestyle, etc.</p>
<p>With Tribaldata, this value doesn’t get lost but rather gets transformed into points that can be used for good actions – like planting trees!</p>
<p>By planting trees, you are reducing your digital carbon footprint generated using internet. This means that you are contributing to a more sustainable world effortlessly, without spending a penny, and without giving up on any of your online hobbies, interests or social life.</p>
<p>This is what we call “Good Data”.</p>

		</div>

	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Once you’ve installed the APP, we will ask you some basic information about you and your interests. You can also use cookies to share other information that you already share with other websites and APPs. All this info will feed your anonymous profile (we call it Tribe Card) and help research and advertising entities get more accurate data.</p>
<p>The first time you activate your anonymous profile, you will receive welcome points that you can use to plant your first tree.</p>
<p>Afterwards, you will receive weekly points for keeping your profile active for advertising – whether you see ads or not. We will use notifications to let you know about new points, new opportunities to earn points and how you can use your points for good. You can also use the section “my activity” to stay updated.</p>

				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>It is the name we have given to your anonymous advertising digital profile. Each Tribaldata user has its own.</p>
<p>Your profile is the sum of the data that you add and activate on the APP. It is encrypted and store in a safe server in the cloud in line with our <a href="http://www.tribaldata.es/en/privacy-policy">data protection policy</a>.</p>
<p>Only you and Tribaldata know that this profile belongs to you. All other parties will only receive anonymous data for them to use to improve the relevance of their advertising. Cookies only have a lifespan of 60 days, which means that in order to keep earning points and plant tree you will need to reactivate your profile every 60 days. Through the APP, you will be able to control your tribe card and keep it active.</p>
<p>The more data you add to your card, the more valuable for ad campaign it become, and the more points you earn every week.</p>

			<p>Upon activating your tribe card, you are giving your consent for collaborating brands to use your anonymous data. They will use it to better tailor their ad campaign and the ads that you and other users will see on your devices. This is what allows us to generate the money to plant your trees!</p>
<p>To this aim, we need to use your Mobile Device Identification and install cookies in your devices. You can always control the status of your card in “My Tribe Card” section. When your tribe card is green, it means it is active and therefore earning you points. The more data you share, the more points your receive every week.</p>
<p>Every 60 days, your tribe card will need to be re-activated. When it is about to go off, it will turn orange, then red once it becomes inactive. This means you will not be earning points anymore until you re-activate it.</p>
<p>Remember that whatever you do, you are already a part of the digital economy just by using the internet. Nothing is going to change on other sites or platforms. The difference is that Tribaldata gives you back control over that same data so that we can all&nbsp; do something good for the environment – just by using the APP.</p>
<p>Similarly, you will see advertising when navigating the web just as before. The only change is that part of those ads – from those advertisers who are partnering with us – will be more relevant to you and therefore less annoying. Isn’t that great?</p>

				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Whenever you have enough points to plant a tree and decide to use them, these will get added to the points contributed by fellow tree-planters. Periodically, we will donate the monetary equivalent of all points to renown and trusted organizations on the ground that will manage the planting process.</p>
<p>In our web, we provide updated information on our partner organizations. We will also keep you informed on the status of each planting project via emails and within our APP.</p>

			<p>In the App, go to the&nbsp; “My achievements” section to check the status of your individual contributions as well as updated information about the impact the whole Tribaldata community is making on the planet. Soon, we will launch a ranking so you can see where you stand in comparison with your fellow tribe members.</p>
<p>Each plantation project is linked to a geolocalized field and all funds are used for reforestation, agro-forestation and extreme poverty reduction projects which involve the local populations.</p>

			<p>Every single action you take in the digital world, from sending an email to launching a search in your browser, streaming a show or commenting on social media, generates CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>The servers that are used to allow all these actions consume a huge amount of energy which – in its large majority – is not renewable.</p>
<p>Tribaldata allows you to offset your digital carbon footprint generated by the daily usage of your phone, tablet or computer.</p>

			<p>We are constantly working to improve the Tribaldata APP. As such, we will go on incorporating new data-sharing options for you to build your Tribe Card, increasing its weekly value and thereby the amount of points you will receive. The more you make points, the more trees you can plant.</p>
<p>In addition, you can help generate a snowball effect by sharing the APP with your friends and grow the Tribe. Every time you invite a friend, and they invite their friend, you impact grows from 1 to 7 trees planted!</p>

			<p>Only companies who fulfill the current requirements in terms of data protection will be allowed to process your data and cookies. In any case, remember that you profile always remains anonymous.</p>
<p>This information will mostly be used for “top brands” campaigns during the validity period of your tribe card. Every time you re-activate your tribe card in the APP you will see examples of brands that have been using your data.</p>
<p>You can also check our <a href="https://tribaldata.es/en/cookie-policy/%E2%80%8E">cookie policy</a> and our <a href="https://tribaldata.es/en/privacy-policy/">data protection policy</a> to see what companies we collaborate with.</p>

			<p>We combine your tribe card’s data together with the data from other “similar” consumers provided by our partners. This allows us to generate statistically relevant and therefore targetable anonymous consumer profiles that match the main advertising targets.</p>
<p>With better targeting, consumer brands in the UK and Spain can create more efficient and relevant campaigns. The mixing of our users’ data with our partners’ data is what helps us generate the revenues that will be used to plant trees in your name.</p>

<p>More to it, you control what data to add to your tribe card for advertising use. which is for rent, and to whom.&nbsp; Of course, we comply with all applicable data laws and regulations, but for us following the law isn’t enough. We believe that you need not only to be able to control, but also understand.</p>
<p>That is extremely important to us which is why if you feel that we are providing you with too many privacy notifications in the APP, please bare with us – it’s for a good cause!</p>

<p>Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general. <br></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="119" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png" alt="" srcset="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png 436w, https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption>The face of evil</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>ReCAPTCHA is yet another free-of-charge product offered benevolently by Google for any webmaster to implement within their own services. How does ReCAPTCHA differentiate legitimate human users from bots? ReCAPTCHA relies extensively on user fingerprinting, putting emphasis on the question of “Which human is this user?” rather than the ordinary “Is this user human?”. It’s worth noting how much easier it is to successfully solve ReCAPTCHAs when the user is logged into their Google account, thus allowing Google to associate their actions with their real identity. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9vmsyp/google_recaptchas_targeting_firefox_and_other/">similar effect</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147015">often reported</a> for users of non-Google browsers, who notice ReCAPTCHAs take more time to complete in Firefox over Chrome. This is in-line with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-mozilla-vp-says-google-intentionally-damaged-firefox/">many other anti-competitive techniques</a> that Google has used over the years to help grow their market share.</p>



<p>Although determining
exactly how ReCAPTCHA works is very difficult, with Google not only
heavily obfuscating its JavaScript, but also implementing an entire
VM in JavaScript with its own bytecode language, there have still
been many attempts to reverse-engineer some of the client-side code,
as well as to theorize about how the server-side logic operates.
<a href="https://github.com/toogle/InsideReCaptcha">Initial attempts</a>
at reverse-engineering ReCAPTCHA show copious amounts of information
belong collected, including but not limited to: plugins, user agent,
IP address, screen resolution, execution times, timezone, language,
click/keyboard/touch information within the frame of the captcha,
test results of many browser-specific functions and CSS evaluation,
information about canvas element rendering, and cookies, including
those affiliated with your Google account that were placed within the
last 6 months.</p>



<p>There is a good reason why ReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google’s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. As JavaScript is now required to even view a ReCAPTCHA, even a user running software such as TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) may find themselves giving away more information than they intend to, for example if they have resized their browser window (which is discouraged for exactly this reason).</p>



<p>Correspondingly, webmasters that use Google’s ReCAPTCHA on their websites must link to both Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms</a> pages (included in the form by default in a small 8px style that makes them appear unclickable). Although Google used to have its own privacy and terms pages for ReCAPTCHA, these links are no longer specific to ReCAPTCHA, but rather are the privacy and terms pages for all users of Google services in general, regardless of which service is being used, or if the user has (or even wants) a Google account to begin with. Therefore accepting these terms (implicitly, by attempting to prove you are Not A Robot) grants Google permission to do <strong>everything</strong> that they do to their regular users of their services to you, and little information is available as to what specifically is done (GDPR is likely to be unhelpful here, given ReCAPTCHA’s spam-stopping purpose). Not only are the unhelpful links in the ReCAPTCHA box never opened by users, but there is also no Google logo or visual reference to indicate that ReCAPTCHA is a Google service, so many users have zero indication that they have just consented to all of Google’s tracking just because they tried to leave feedback or create a ticket on your website. If you thought you could use the Internet without using Google’s services, try using the Internet without filling out a single ReCAPTCHA, which for some users is required to pay their bills, file their taxes, and sometimes even use Government websites (if you somehow manage this, next try never sending email to Gmail/Gsuite addresses or using Google APIs for a more exciting challenge). Good luck.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that caring about user privacy to this extent is likely to be outside of the scope of concern for most websites. Many websites are already so tightly coupled to Google’s services (commonly including Google analytics, Google ads, Google APIs, Google tag manager, Google static resources, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and many others) that the addition of a Google captcha appears negligible. With that said, different websites have different values and different users, and many do not want to require users to agree to Google’s tracking and labor for basic usage. The level of centralization that ReCAPTCHA forces is not good for anyone except Google.</p>



<p>Apart from the privacy implications of ReCAPTCHA usage, the actual captcha is very tedious for many classes of users, sometimes becoming so difficult that users find themselves unable to to complete the captcha at all. <a href="https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/286">Users hate ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8yezeq/fuck_recaptcha/">They</a> <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1754031/fuck-recaptcha-fuck-google-for-making-recaptcha-fuck-it-dont-be-evil-my-foot">really</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-select-all-images-with-a-street-sign-recaptcha-is-a-godless-creation-of-evil.1410504/">hate</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19059390">ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://recaptcha.sucks/">ReCAPTCHA</a> <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2019/04/make-recaptchas-im-not-a-robot-accurate">is</a> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/recaptcha-is-uxs-worst-nightmare-c28b7341e88a">so</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9haexn/googles_recaptcha_needs_to_be_fucking_made_illegal/">hated</a> that <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">some websites</a> have a profit model of charging users $20 annually to disable ReCAPTCHA, which <strong>thousands </strong>of users pay for. If this sounds like a great new business model to you and now you want to add ReCAPTCHAs to every page of your website to attempt to maximize profit, I will find you. And I will force you to complete a ReCAPTCHA every time you want food or water until you die from malnutrition after the first week. I have read countless posts from users that became so frustrated with a service that used excessive ReCAPTCHAs that they swore to never use the offending website again. These are often intelligent users with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">no disabilities</a> who are simply tired of being treated like dirt and wasting their time. Be kind to your users and help minimize the amount of ReCAPTCHAS that they have to solve just to be allowed to use the Internet.</p>



<p>ReCAPTCHAs become significantly more difficult if the user attempts to ‘opt-out’ of Google’s services and tracking by using software that hinders it, such as VPNs, TBB, and many anti-tracking browser addons and modifications. To demonstrate what is meant by ‘very tedious’, below is a real-time recording of myself solving a single ReCAPTCHA using TBB:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-1.webm"></video><figcaption>Spambots are known to give up when forced to be patient</figcaption></figure>



<p>I got lucky and only needed to complete two challenges. Sometimes there are ten or more. Watching the above video, you might think to yourself “I knew the tor network was slow, but I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> slow!”. You would be correct to take note of this discrepancy. If we open up the web developer console, we can see that the HTTP requests for new captcha images only take a few hundred milliseconds. Despite this, Google’s heavily-obfuscated JavaScript intentionally delays the appearance of the new images by several seconds every time, which I’m sure has something to do with the fact that bots give up when forced to wait, probably. This is not a nice way to treat users that don’t want to perform unpaid labor and be fingerprinted by Google. Keep in mind that the above video demonstrates one of the worst possible cases of ReCAPTCHA UX (which some <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31088-morecaptcha/code">userscripts</a> may improve), and that the average user has a significantly quicker experience, providing that they are not attempting to thwart any of Google’s tracking and don’t make many mistakes.</p>



<p>In addition to this tediousness, the actual labor that the user is performing is directly used to benefit Google. Worry not however, as Google is eager to brag about the selfless humanitarianism that you’re engaging in by choosing ReCAPTCHA, stating the following on their main ReCAPTCHA <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">page</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hundreds of millions of captchas are solved by people every day. ReCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving captchas into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This
is certainly a very rosy way of convincing
you to feel good about forcing
your users to engage in unpaid labor that directly benefits the
world’s most powerful surveillance corporation. ReCAPTCHA
is free for a reason.</p>



<p>Lastly, ReCAPTCHA is popular. Very popular. While this brings some advantages, it also means that there’s significant efforts to break ReCAPTCHA, and those efforts all potentially affect your website, with your captcha implementation being perfectly identical to a million others. As a result of this, there have been <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/wangz3/publications/ccs18.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">published</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha">that</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2">break</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612">ReCAPTCHA</a> over the years, generally with Google making modifications to improve their captcha afterwards. There have also been <a href="https://2captcha.com/">paid-for</a> <a href="https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">services</a> that use human labor to solve captchas on behalf of a paying client for less than a cent each. For a modern and user-friendly example of bypassing ReCAPTCHA, see Buster. <a href="https://github.com/dessant/buster">Buster</a> is a modern browser extension (Firefox+Chrome+Opera) which helps you to solve difficult captchas by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges for you by using speech recognition.</p>











<p>Before implementing a captcha, it’s worth considering if one is
necessary to begin with. To help with evaluating this proposition,
consider if your threat model is concerned over <em>customized</em> or
<em>uncustomized</em> spam. Uncustomized spam is pervasive across many
Internet protocols, and you will encounter it quickly after enabling
HTTP, SSH, or …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Nash has upgraded our client protocols to generate signatures with secure multi-party computation (MPC), the technology behind our <a href="https://blog.nash.io/nash-launches-decentralized-api-keys/">decentralized API keys</a>. Our non-custodial blockchain wallets can now offer hardware-level security at no cost!</p><p>This upgrade means that users’ full private keys no longer play a role in signing transactions on Nash. Instead, transactions are co-signed with Nash via MPC, enabling us to enforce security policies like address whitelisting and withdrawal limits.</p><p>Users can still store their seed phrase and private keys offline for use with third-party wallets, giving them full access to their funds if Nash is offline – just like the paper backup of a hardware wallet seed phrase.</p><p>Unlike hardware wallets, however, Nash accounts are completely free and have the look and feel of familiar online platforms. What’s more, with configurable security policies, they are arguably safer than hardware. If your Nash login is hacked, the damage an attacker can do is limited.</p><p>Thanks to MPC, holding the keys to your crypto became safer and easier!</p><h2 id="what-is-multi-party-computation-mpc-">What is multi-party computation (MPC)?</h2><p>A blockchain approves or refuses a transaction by verifying its signature. A private key is one way of generating a valid signature. If you have the private key for an address, you can always sign transactions going out of that address.</p><p>However, there are other ways of generating signatures that do not give one party all the power. By splitting the generation of signatures between two parties, it becomes impossible for one party to approve transactions unilaterally.</p><p>This can be achieved using secure multi-party computation (MPC), where two parties must collaborate to generate a valid blockchain signature. Using our new protocol, both Nash and a user have their own key. These keys each generate what is known as a “pre-signature”. The two pre-signatures are then combined into a single valid signature.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qdj8LcHfHR_dD0Gr7szIcwvsXPOlRIuHpWOXajqHvKezd93mED2W2Kyb4MY86j7OzFr6PuUlKBKkMzRIX47JHg_Virw4gBZWKtVv5-9h2gx1bUD1cvdkM2rNjJsreTtQEaAgOozt" alt=""></figure><h2 id="advanced-non-custodial-security">Advanced non-custodial security</h2><p>MPC makes it possible for users to set up specific permissions associated with their account – for instance, a withdrawal address whitelist or withdrawal limits. If a user attempts to withdraw too much, or to the wrong address, Nash will withhold its pre-signature and nothing will happen.</p><p>Of course, Nash alone is also unable to issue or authorize any transaction. The system is designed such that the user is the only one capable of initiating transactions. It remains non-custodial.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NC8yRKOPyuevORf2hA1M4psfhACKc3Jl2_S9kpHCF3Ljalo6pSH-E0Y1cuJhoGXgyjkA-Vi6v59s1prOtESSz2Qp3bKwkJkiK7Yd8SA3aC1GrlmykbweaoDMjZ8__3A1KmQcBbCx" alt=""></figure><p>You can hear our Applied Research team – Nash co-founder Ethan Fast and applied cryptographer Robert Annessi – discuss MPC on Episode 1 of our podcast <a href="https://podcast.nash.io/912007/4884014-applied-research-and-cryptography-with-cryptographer-robert-annessi-from-nash"><em>Beyond the Chain</em></a>.</p><h2 id="the-nash-wallet-system-in-detail">The Nash wallet system in detail</h2><p>Here’s a more technical overview of how Nash’s MPC protocol is implemented. First, we describe how keys are set up when the user creates an account, then how they are used on subsequent logins.</p><p><em>Account creation</em></p><ol><li>A<strong> master secret</strong> is generated securely in the user’s browser. This secret is used to derive private keys for all blockchains supported by Nash.</li><li>The user’s login information (email and password) is hashed in the browser and two key pairs are derived, one for authentication (normal login) and one for encryption/decryption. The <strong>encryption/decryption keys</strong> are never sent to Nash but are rederived locally whenever a user logs in – meaning <em>Nash can never decrypt the user’s private wallet information.</em> The <strong>authentication key</strong> is used to authenticate user login with the Nash server, just like a normal password exchange on a typical website.</li><li>The master secret is encrypted using the user’s encryption key. Call this the <strong>encrypted master secret. </strong>A backup of the encrypted master secret is sent to Nash – but <em>Nash cannot decrypt this information, since this would require the user’s decryption key</em>.</li><li>For each blockchain key derived from the master secret, the user’s browser generates <strong>two sub-keys</strong> using a 2-2 MPC key generation protocol. When some data is signed by each of these keys independently, the resulting signatures can be combined to produce a signature as if the original private key signed the information. This kind of protocol is called a <strong>threshold signature protocol,</strong> with the central property that one sub-key alone cannot sign anything, and when co-signing the original private key is never accessed or constructed by either party.</li><li><strong>One sub-key</strong> is sent to Nash to store unencrypted. This is Nash’s key, which can be used to approve future trades and transactions. The <strong>other sub-key</strong> is encrypted with the user’s encryption key and stored by Nash for retrieval by the user’s browser when they next log in. <em>Nash cannot use or access this key because it is encrypted.</em></li></ol><p>So, Nash has access to one sub-key but not the other. The user retrieves their sub-key by logging in, getting an encrypted data package from Nash and decrypting it. This all happens automatically with keys derived from user login information.</p><p><em>Login</em></p><ol><li>The user’s <strong>decryption key</strong> is derived in their browser from their username and password. The <strong>authentication key</strong> is also derived and used to log in, with an optional 2FA check.</li><li>After the user authenticates with their account info, authentication key and optional 2FA, their <strong>encrypted MPC sub-key</strong> is sent from Nash to their browser.</li><li>The user’s browser decrypts the MPC sub-key and uses it to provide signatures for trades or other transactions on the Nash platform. If the activity meets the policy requirements set up by the user, Nash will “complete” these signatures with its own sub-key to produce the signatures required for the user’s activity. For transactions, the resulting completed signature will be sent to the chain. For trades, the signatures will be processed like any other user signatures in the Nash state channels.</li></ol><p>In the event that their sub-key is compromised, a user can log in and revoke it, and an attacker does not have the power to do anything with the blockchain funds in their account. Users can also retrieve their <strong>encrypted master secret</strong> from Nash to recover their full private key information by passing additional 2FA and email verification rounds.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-crypto-funds-management">The future of crypto funds management</h2><p>The Nash wallet system represents a significant advance over current popular solutions for storing cryptocurrency.</p><ul><li>Funds held on centralized exchanges are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/08/15/hackers-stole-over-4-billion-from-crypto-crimes-in-2019-so-far-up-from-1-7-billion-in-all-of-2018/?sh=372b8e2255f5">vulnerable to hackers</a> and contradict one of the basic principles of digital assets: self-custody.</li><li>Software wallet solutions, e.g. encrypted private keys, are vulnerable to hacks of user machines.

This blog will be skipping a large amount of information about Crux, how it works, and much of its available functionality. For more information about the Crux HTTP API, please take a look at the <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html">Crux HTTP module documentation</a>.
Throughout this guide, you will see links to targeted extra reading and information, should you wish to read more.

<div>
<p>This guide will install Crux using the Clojure CLI tools. You can find in the other methods of installing Crux in the <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/installation.html">Crux installation docs</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have the Clojure CLI tools installed, installers are available from the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools">Clojure Getting Started Guide</a>. Don’t worry, you don’t need to know Clojure or the Clojure toolchain to run Crux. Just copy the commands below.</p>
<p>(1) First, create a directory to house the settings for your new Crux node by running the following in your terminal:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir crux-cli &amp;&amp; cd crux-cli</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>(2) Next, create two new files within this directory named <code>deps.edn</code> and <code>crux.edn</code> with the following configuration code:</p>
<div>
<p>;; deps.edn</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">{:deps {org.clojure/clojure   {:mvn/version "1.10.1"}
        juxt/crux-core        {:mvn/version "21.01-1.14.0-beta"}
        juxt/crux-http-server {:mvn/version "21.01-1.14.0-alpha"}}}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>;; crux.edn</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">{:crux.http-server/server {:port 3000}} <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>This configuration tells Crux to start an HTTP server on port 3000.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>(3) Last, and still from within <code>crux-cli</code>, run this command in your terminal:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="sh">clojure -M -m crux.main <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>You will probably see a <code>SLF4J: Failed to load class</code> error. Just ignore it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Two minutes are up and your Crux node is running. Nice work! To check that everything is working, head over to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a> where you should see the Crux console.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_part_2_talking_to_crux_over_http"><a href="#_part_2_talking_to_crux_over_http"></a>Part 2: Talking to Crux Over HTTP</h2>
<div>
<p>At the moment, the database is empty. Before we can start to play with some of the features that Crux has to offer, we need to add some data. We will be using the <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html#rest-api">REST API</a> to send and receive JSON via <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>.</p>
<p>For this guide, we will be working with facts about the current president of the United States.
At the time of writing, the current president is Joe Biden. Lets add that to the database:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -d '{"tx-ops": [
           ["put", { <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
                "crux.db/id": "president", <i data-value="2"></i><b>(2)</b>
                "name": "Joe", <i data-value="3"></i><b>(3)</b>
                "last-name": "Biden" <i data-value="4"></i><b>(4)</b>
            }]
         ]}' \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/submit-tx</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td><code>put</code> - The type of operation we are performing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="2"></i><b>2</b></td>
<td>The ID for the document we are adding</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="3"></i><b>3</b></td>
<td>The name to be associated with <code>president</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="4"></i><b>4</b></td>
<td>The last name to be associated with the <code>president</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>We see that a transaction has been received by our locally running Crux node. Now lets retrieve the entity:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>GET the entity by the same ID we used above</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>We see that the data we just put in the database is successfully showing up at the ID <code>president</code>.</p>
<p>Joe Biden hasn’t always been the president of the United States.</p>
<p>With Crux, we can add data to the past (or the future) by passing a 'valid time' along with the document. Notice that we are using the same ID as before, something that wouldn’t work in a traditional database.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -d '{"tx-ops": [
           ["put", {
                "crux.db/id": "president", <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
                "name": "Donald",
                "last-name": "Trump"
            }, "2017-01-20"] <i data-value="2"></i><b>(2)</b>
         ]}' \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/submit-tx</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>The same ID as our first <code>put</code> operation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="2"></i><b>2</b></td>
<td>The valid time for the document being added</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The above <code>put</code> operation places Donald Trump at the ID <code>president</code> from a valid date of <code>2017-01-20</code>, his inauguration date.</p>
<p>Now lets retrieve the <code>president</code> entity again:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We get the same result - Joe Biden!</p>
<p>The GET request of <code>/entity</code> returns the data that is currently valid for the ID <code>president</code>.</p>
<p>This is the first example of the power of a temporal database. We are able to ingest data to provide a better history of data should we want to look back.</p>
<p>To retrieve the Donald Trump document we just added, we can pass a valid time with our GET request:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president\&amp;valid-time=2020-10-10 <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>We pass a valid time of <code>2020-10-10</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The above operation allows us to find out who the president was on the date passed. Crux will return Donald Trump for any date between <code>2017-01-20</code> and the valid time on the Joe Biden document.</p>
<p>We can see all of our transactions by passing some more arguments to the same <code>/entity</code> endpoint:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president\&amp;history=true\&amp;sortOrder=desc\&amp;withDocs=true <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td><code>history=true</code> returns all historical documents for this entity</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>If you look closely at the Joe Biden document, the <code>validTime</code> is equal to today’s date. This is because we did not explicitly provide a 'valid time' with our initial <code>put</code>. By default, Crux assumes <code>validTime</code> is equal to the current date-time unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Let’s correct the entry for Joe Biden by passing the correct 'valid time':</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -d '{"tx-ops": [
           ["put", {
                "crux.db/id": "president",
                "name": "Joe",
                "last-name": "Biden"
            }, "2021-01-20"] <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
         ]}' \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/submit-tx</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Again, <code>"2021-01-20"</code> is our explicit 'valid time' parameter.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>We now have a historically accurate dataset for the last two presidents of the United States that we can query over a temporal plane! You can run the history query again to validate our correction.</p>
<p>Using Crux, we can do powerful queries over the temporal plane and retrieve data as if we had travelled back in time.<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> Crux achieves this by maintaining an immutable (write-only) transaction log. This makes Crux a powerful asset where auditing is important or when looking back at historical data is valuable. Better still, Crux can build on top of many different DB solutions allowing you to retain the infrastructure you already know and love!</p>
<p>In this guide, we used 3 operations: storing documents with <code>submit-tx</code>, retrieving documents with <code>entity</code>, and retrieving document histories with <code>history=true</code>. The complete set of 18 REST operations, including RESTful <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html#post-query">Datalog queries</a>, are explained in the <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html#rest-api">Crux REST API documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Crux also supports a number of other protocols and features:</p>

<p>Now that you’ve dipped your toes in the temporal data waters, we encourage you to experiment with the more advanced features of Crux!</p>

    <h2 id="hn-hijacks-your-brain">HN hijacks your brain</h2>
<p>You're an engineer who looks at Hacker News 2-5 times a day. HN is a good way to <em>fill the gaps</em> in time. You scan the front page- repeatedly- for links of interest... reading titles, eyeing scores... often jumping directly to the (overtly contrarian) comments to see if a link is even worth the energy.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>That cycle hits a sickening <strong>5</strong>/10 of Tristan Harris's <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">list of mind hijacks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Control the Menu, Control the Choices</li>
<li>(3)  Fear of missing something important</li>
<li>(4)  Social Approval (upvotes)</li>
<li>(6)  Bottomless bowl</li>
<li>(10) Forecasting</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These hijacks  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">aren't</a> intentional, they're just a byproduct of link aggregation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoics are turning in their graves, where instead of knowing what's important, the links on HN <em>become</em> what's important, no matter how trivial, pedantic, hyped, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>So if you want help breaking this negative feedback loop, I encourage you to reclaim your attention by turning HN into and RSS feed;</p>
<p>Get more <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">done</a>. Ignore the comments and the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">mooks</a>. Set limits. It's incredibly liberating to finish your RSS feed and think to yourself, <em>now what</em>?</p>

<p>Declaring what deserves your attention is the defining feature of RSS, so it's important to declare what aspect of HN you like. Generally people look at high scores. Fortunately HN already has a url specifically for its most "important" (i.e. upvoted) links: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a>.</p>
<p>So if we can subscribe to the links from that page, we'll get the bulk of the links that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>For me, it's critically important for RSS to be a self-hosted solution. No third parties <small>(I'm looking at <em>you</em>, Feedly)</small>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of retaking control, you're just shunting control to yet another third party.</p>
<p>My personal setup goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Raspberry Pi you bought but never used</li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li>Run FreshRSS</li>
<li>Add HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a> as an RSS feed</li>
<li>(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</li>
<li>(Optional) Pick out a smartphone app to sync with</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first thing that worked for me, so by no means is it the guaranteed best. Recommendations and alternatives are welcome! You can, of course, tailor the following guide if you'd like to use a VPS.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-the-pi">Prepare the Pi</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>
<p>Do a standard Raspbian setup the with <a href="https://soapstone.mradford.com/raspberry-pi-automatic-wifi-and-ssh">internet/ssh/hostname</a>. Then install git:</p>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install git
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h4>
<pre><span>curl -sSL</span><span> https://get.docker.com | </span><span>sh
</span></pre><pre><span>sudo</span><span> usermod</span><span> -aG</span><span> docker pi &amp;&amp; </span><span>sudo</span><span> reboot
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker-compose">Install Docker-compose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is specifically for Raspbian, if you're using a VPS or non-ARM machine, install docker-compose the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">conventional</a> way.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> libffi-dev libssl-dev
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> python3 python3-pip
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get remove python-configparser
</span><span>sudo</span><span> pip3 install docker-compose
</span></pre>
<pre><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS

cd FreshRSS/Docker
</span></pre>
<p>We're using a Raspberry Pi, so you'll need to pick out the ARM image! Use your favorite editor to modify these lines of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><span># docker-compose.yml
</span><span>-    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
</span><span>+    image: freshrss/freshrss:arm
</span></pre>
<p>Now you're ready to execute FreshRSS:</p>
<pre><span>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span> -d
</span></pre>
<p>Once that's complete, head to your Pi's IP address (or hostname, if you opted for that) on port <code>8080</code> in your laptop's/desktop's browser (something like http://1.2.3.4:8080), and go through the initial setup.</p>

<p>Add <code>https://hnrss.org/best</code> as an RSS feed (from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've officially RSS-ified HN!</p>
<h3 id="optional-port-forwarding-and-dns-setup">(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</h3>
<p>Unless you went with the VPS route, you're probably behind a LAN, so if you want to access your RSS outside your LAN, you'll need to set up port forwarding and/or DNS. That's beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many guides online that can get you there.</p>
<h3 id="optional-pick-out-an-app">(Optional) Pick out an app</h3>
<p>You could just expose the pi to the internet, and read RSS directly from the browser, but I think having an app is a nice touch.</p>
<p>First you'll need to enable API access in FreshRSS. Go to <code>Authentication</code> and check the box to allow API access:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-auth.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot1"></p>
<p>Then create an API key under <code>Profile</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-profile.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot2"></p>
<p>Now you can use the API url and the API key in your selected app to pull data down locally. Nice!</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of open-source (Android) apps to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readrops/Readrops">Readrops</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readrops.app">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/news-android">New Android</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.luhmer.owncloudnewsreader&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">play store</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/fistons/TinyTinyFeed">TinyTinyFeed</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.poopeeland.tinytinyfeed">play store</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, a lot of the closed source RSS apps I've checked out tend to be slightly higher in quality, so if you're willing to compromise on that front then they are worth exploring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-we-gain">What did we gain?</h2>
<p>It may not seem like it, but we've gained a <strong>lot</strong> by doing this!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defeated the mind hijacks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strike>(1)</strike> Gained leverage over the "menu"</li>
<li><strike>(3)</strike> Declared which things are important up front, and view them only <em>once</em></li>
<li><strike>(4)</strike> Ignore comments. Scores only matter in that they are relatively high</li>
<li><strike>(6)</strike> Created a bottom (of the bowl) by grabbing a limited number of links</li>
<li><strike>(10)</strike> Easily defer time intensive links for later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>
<ul>
<li>Prevent re-reads of HN</li>
<li>Make it easier to pick out the most interesting links and discard irrelevant ones</li>
<li>If you <em>really</em> want to read comments, you'll need to go out of your way</li>
<li>Star or bookmark links to read more in-depth at a later time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data sovereignty</strong>
<ul>
<li>We control our own data; no relying on third parties (e.g. Feedly)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Resilience</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lose a phone? Upgrade computers? Need to sync between phone and desktop? No problem!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The ability to add other RSS feeds</strong>
<ul>
<li>We've opened up the ability to use RSS in other feeds
<ul>
<li>For reddit, just <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/320264/how-to-get-an-rss-feed-for-any-subreddit/">append</a> <code>.rss</code> to any url</li>
<li>For youtube, plug in the URL to any channel!</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><a href="https://etcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etcd</a> is a distributed key-value store designed to be a highly available and strongly consistent data store for distributed systems. In fact, by default Kubernetes itself uses etcd to store all of its cluster data, such as configs and metadata.</p><p>As with designing any system, different architectural decisions lead to different tradeoffs that impact the optimal way a system should be used and operated. In this blogpost, we discuss the inner workings of etcd to help draw conclusions for how you can best use this key-value store in your own application.</p><ol><li>The stability of etcd's Raft cluster is sensitive to network and disk IO. Add robust handling in clients (such as retries) for possible downtime, when the cluster has lost its leadership.</li><li>Carefully tune the number of nodes in your cluster to account for failure tolerance and network utilization.</li><li>If running a large datastore that can't fit into memory, try to run etcd with SSDs to help with reads and general disk latency.</li><li>Range reads will be most efficient if you tend to write and read the same pieces of information together.</li><li>Frequent compactions are essential to maintaining etcd's memory and disk usage.</li><li>For applications with workloads where keys are frequently updated, defrags should be run to free up unneeded space to disk.</li></ol><p>etcd is a key-value store built to serve data for highly distributed systems. Building an understanding of how etcd is designed to support this use-case can help reason through its best use. To do so, we will explore how etcd provides availability and consistency, and how it stores data internally. Design decisions, such as the consensus algorithm chosen for guaranteeing consistency, can heavily influence the system’s operation. Meanwhile, the underlying structure of the datastore can impact how the data is optimally accessed and managed. With these considerations in mind, etcd can serve as a reliable store for even the most critical data in your system. </p><p>In order to provide high availability, etcd is run as a cluster of replicated nodes. To ensure data consistency across these nodes, etcd uses a popular consensus algorithm called <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft</a>. In Raft, one node is elected as leader, while the remaining nodes are designated as followers. The leader is responsible for maintaining the current state of the system and ensuring that the followers are up-to-date.</p><p>More specifically, the leader node has the following responsibilities: (1) maintaining leadership and (2) log replication.</p><h3>Maintaining Leadership</h3><p>The leader node must periodically send a heartbeat to all followers to notify them that it is still alive and active. If the followers have not received a heartbeat after a configurable timeout, a new leader election is initiated. During this process, the system will be unavailable, as a leader is necessary to enforce the current state.</p><p>By effect, the etcd cluster's stability is very sensitive to network and disk IO. This means that etcd's stability is susceptible to heavy workloads, both from itself and other applications running in the environment. <b><u>It is recommended clients use robust handling, such as retries, to account for the possibility of lost leadership.</u></b></p><h3>Log Replication</h3><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2d03b6eda524ead98d5a6daf0f426dc9/logreplication.png"><figcaption>Screenshot from raft.github.io's helpful Raft Visualization, which demonstrates how Log Replication works. In this screenshot, S2 is the leader and broadcasting the log entries to all followers.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The leader node is responsible for handling incoming write transactions from the client. The write operation is written to a Raft log entry, which the leader broadcasts to the followers to ensure consistency across all nodes. Once a majority of the followers have successfully acknowledged and applied the Raft log entry, the leader considers the transaction as committed. If at any point the leader is unable to receive acknowledgement from the <em>majority</em> of followers, (for instance, if some node(s) fail), then the transaction cannot be committed and the write fails.</p><p>As a result, if the leader is unable to reach a majority, the cluster is declared to have "lost quorum" and no transactions can be made until it has recovered. This is why you should <b><u>carefully tune the number of etcd nodes in your cluster</u></b> to reduce the chance of lost quorum.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is to select an odd number of nodes. This is because adding an additional node to an odd number of nodes does not help increase the failure tolerance. Consider the following table, where the failure tolerance is the number of nodes that can fail without the cluster losing quorum:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cluster Size</th><th scope="col">Majority</th><th scope="col">Failure Tolerance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table borrowed from <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/</a>, showing that a cluster’s failure tolerance does not increase for a cluster of size N when compared to a cluster of size N-1, where N is even.</p></div><p>This helps visualize that a cluster of size 4 has the same failure tolerance as a cluster size of 3. Increasing the number of nodes will also result in an increase in network utilization, as the leader must send all log entries to every node. So, in the case of choosing an etcd cluster with 3 vs 4 nodes, 3 nodes will give you the same failure tolerance with less network utilization.</p><p>Now that we understand how etcd maintains high availability and consistency, let's discuss how data is actually stored in the system.</p><h3>BoltDB</h3><p>etcd's datastore is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoltDB</a>, or more specifically, <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBoltDB</a>, a fork of BoltDB maintained by the etcd contributors.</p><p>Bolt is a Go key-value store which writes its data to a single memory-mapped file. This means that the underlying operating system is responsible for handling how the data is cached, typically caching as much of the file in memory as possible. Thus, Bolt shows high memory usage when working with large datasets. However, assuming that the relevant page is in the cache, this method allows for fast reads.</p><p>Bolt's underlying data structure is a B+ tree consisting of 4KB pages that are allocated as needed. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B+ tree</a> structure helps with quick reads and sequential writes. However, Bolt does not perform as well on random writes, since the writes might be made to different pages on disk.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/0b9d9a6c879fc3a79ef726a9a37019e8/bplustree.svg"><figcaption>Bolt stores its data in a B+ tree, a structure that helps with quick reads and sequential writes. Highlighted in green is the path taken to find the data with 4 as the key.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Bolt operations are copy-on-write. When a page is updated, it is copied to a completely new page. The old page is added to a "freelist", which Bolt refers to when it needs a new page. This means that deleting large amounts of data will not actually free up space on disk, as the pages are instead kept on Bolt's freelist for future use. In order to free up this space to disk, you will need to perform a defrag, which we'll discuss later in this post.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/fb222f0306d31ddb48305545eb1d5b07/freelist.png"><figcaption>When data is deleted from Bolt, unused pages are not released back to disk, but kept in Bolt’s freelist for future use.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>etcd's Data Model</h3><p>etcd uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiVersion Concurrency Control</a> in order to safely handle concurrent operations. This goes hand-in-hand with the Raft protocol, as each version in MVCC corresponds to an index in the Raft log. To handle MVCC, etcd tracks changes by revisions. Each transaction made to etcd is a new revision. For example, if you were to load up a fresh instance of etcd and ran the following operations, the revision state would look like so:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By keeping a history of the revisions, etcd is able to provide the version history for specific keys. In the example above, you would just need to read Revisions 4 and 2 in order to see that the current value of <code>foo</code> is <code>updatedBar</code>, and the previous value was <code>bar</code>.</p><p>This means that keys must be associated with their revision numbers, along with their new values. To do so, etcd stores each operation in Bolt as the following key-value pairs:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Here, <code>rev</code> is the revision, <code>sub</code> is a number used to differentiate keys within a single revision (for example, multiple PUTs in a transaction), and <code>type</code> is an optional suffix, usually used for tombstoning. </p><p>For example, if you ran <code>put foo hello</code> following the above example, the corresponding Bolt entry might look like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By writing the keys in this scheme, etcd is able to make all writes sequential, circumventing Bolt's weakness to random writes.</p><p>However, this makes reading keys a little more difficult. For example, to find the current value of <code>foo</code>, you would have to read each entry starting from the latest revision, until finding the revision containing the value for <code>foo</code>. </p><h3>etcd's Key Index</h3><p>To address the key reading problem described above, etcd builds an in-memory <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/recitations/rec25-B-trees/rec25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-tree</a> index which maps each key to its related revisions.</p><p>The actual keys and values of this tree are a little more complex, but the information it provides can most simply be reduced to:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/db2005cf0e02132e8bddab05f5d4c246/b-tree.svg"><figcaption>A simplified example of etcd’s key index, which maps the keys to their revisions. Highlighted is the path taken to find 'foo3' in the tree.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This index says that <code>foo</code> was updated in revision 4, sub 0, and revision 2, sub 0. <code>foo1</code> was updated in revision 3, sub 0, and so on. Using this information, you can easily find the current value of <code>foo</code>, along with its previous values, in Bolt.</p><p>etcd also supports range reads: "get me the values for <code>foo1</code> to <code>foo3</code>" or "find me all keys and values prefixed with <code>foo</code>". Although these keys are logically sequential, they are not stored in Bolt as so. Performing the range read will require using the key index to find the keys that fall within the range, and then finding their associated revisions in Bolt. Given that these keys could have been written at any revision, these would essentially be random reads on Bolt. Efficiency for this operation heavily relies on the hope that most of Bolt's file is in the cache. If your datastore is large, chances are that the relevant pages will need to be read from disk. <b><u>If you have a large dataset, run etcd with SSDs, as they are much faster than spinning disk.</u></b></p><p>If anything, <b><u>range reads will be slightly more efficient if you tend to read and write the same pieces of information together.</u></b> For example, if you …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h4>Less than half a decade ago, if you had walked up to someone in the industry and said that in 5 years’ time AMD would have the fastest CPUs, you would have been laughed straight out of the room—but here we are. <p>At the time of writing, AMD <em>does</em> have the fastest CPUs on the market with Zen 3, so let’s see where AMD is heading in the future.</p></h4>



<h2>The Ugly Past</h2>



<p>It’s not a controversial statement for me to say that the Bulldozer family of CPUs was a failure. Not just a commercial failure in a period that eventually saw AMD nearing bankruptcy, but also a technical failure. There are however parts of the Bulldozer core that are good such as the FPU and branch predictor unit. Weaknesses in its shared front-end and poor cache/memory systems meant a 4-module Bulldozer CPU lost to a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU in most workloads, despite the higher clocks. Insult to injury for AMD was the the fact that a 4-module Bulldozer CPU also consumed more power than a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU while being slower—in short the architecture was almost universally panned.</p>



<div><p>However, the failure of Bulldozer was not all because of poor CPU design. A lot of Bulldozer’s failures can be traced to its underperforming 32nm node from what was AMD at the time, before its fabs were spun off into Global Foundries. Broadly, the original design goals for Bulldozer were 33% clock speed lift over Phenom on the same 45nm node with no IPC decrease and a release date in 2009. As history shows, this did not happen and so nearly two years later in October 2011, Bulldozer became the product we all know it as: late, hot and slow. </p><p>Thankfully for AMD, when the original Zen architecture released in Q1 2017 it finally showed they weren’t out of the CPU game. Zen 1 had an extremely bullish <strong>40% IPC </strong>increase design goal over Excavator and ultimately delivered an <strong>unheard of 52%</strong> <strong>IPC gain</strong>. AMD was back. Following up with Zen 2 and Zen 3, though they were not the same monstrous uplifts as Zen 1, they represented a respectful 15% and 19% IPC gain over their predecessors respectively. But y’all know that already, so let’s talk about the future of AMD’s CPUs.</p></div>



<h2>A Bright Future</h2>



<p>AMD looks poised for even more continued success with Ryzen, assuming of course that the information and sources that both I and the rest of Chips and Cheese’s staff have access to are accurate. Please take all the following information in this section with the usual cautionary dose of salt. While both the Chips and Cheese team and I have full belief that this information is accurate, that does not mean that this is 100% confirmed and you should not take this as unsalable truth. With this disclaimer out of the way, on to the juicy bits: Zen 3+, Zen 4 and even Zen 5.</p>



<h3>AM5 &amp; DDR5 – New IOD and Future Nodes</h3>



<p>Zen 3+ looks to be a small IPC gain on base Zen 3, having been told “It’s more than Zen+ was [over Zen 1] but not much” which I interpret to mean around a 4 to 7% IPC gain along with customary clock gains moving to the smaller N6 node from TSMC. N6 is a variant of N7 using 5 layers of EUV and is not a true “new node”, more of a refinement. However, the most interesting thing to me is that Zen 3+ on desktop may be the first AM5 CPU. I was told that the IO die for Zen 3+ desktop is using “Not quite [the same] IOD as Zen 4 but uses Zen 4 IP” which I take to mean that it will be using DDR5 and it will be on the same node as Zen 4’s IOD. That’s all I have on Zen 3+, so now on to Zen 4.</p>



<p>Zen 4 is what a lot of people are waiting for, and, if the info I have is accurate, that wait will prove to be even more worth it. It is important to note that the one common thread in all Zen 4 chatter I have heard is resounding positivity. From IPC gains over 25%, a total performance gain of 40%, and even possibly (finally) 5GHz all-core thanks to the new (full node) N5 fabrication at TSMC! Now, I can’t say what is true and what is an over-exaggeration, however I was told from a trusted source that a <strong>Genoa</strong> engineering sample (Zen 4 server chip) was <strong>29% faster</strong> than a Milan (Zen 3) chip with the same core config at <strong>the</strong> <strong>same clocks</strong>. Factor this in with what I have heard about the possible clock gains that N5 will enable over N7 and Zen 4 sounds like it is going to be a <strong>monster</strong> of a CPU.</p>



<p>Now I said I had Zen 5 info, unfortunately this comes from a different, less-proven source than my Zen 4 info, however they have said that the jump [to Zen 5 from 4] from will be about as much as <strong>Piledriver to Zen 1 design goal, which if you recall to earlier in this article was 40%</strong>. I was told from a 3rd source that Zen 5’s original design goal was 2.5 to 3 times the IPC of Zen 1 which roughly lines up with the perspective of a “Piledriver to Zen 1”-like jump.</p>



<h2>Looking Forward… AMD’s Problem is Success</h2>



<p>If this info is all true, then that puts AMD in a very good position from a performance standpoint. However, the biggest problem for AMD of late hasn’t been one of performance but of wafer supply. With Apple moving off of Intel CPUs and onto their own silicon for (gradually) their entire lineup, the supply of N5 wafers from TSMC for AMD will be less than if Apple had stuck with Intel. Being that AMD is always 2nd in line for new nodes at TSMC behind Apple, this may be a cause for concern moving forward. </p>



<h3>Bright Spot: Consoles Out of the Picture with TSMC N5</h3>



<div><p>However, perhaps an even bigger factor for availability on TSMC N5 will be that neither future AMD CPUs nor GPUs will need to compete with console chips as they will remain on N7. Couple this with the rumors that AMD GPUs are also going MCM with RDNA3, and it is possible that Zen 5 and RDNA 3 supply will be better than what we know of the current shortages for Zen 3. This is especially important for the GPU side seeing the current availability issues around RDNA2; the wafer allocation of which has been said to represent low-single digits of TSMC’s N7 supply.  This is all of course, wishful thinking. At this point in time, who knows.</p><p>One thing is certain however: AMD’s future looks bright.</p></div>



<h2>Author’s Note (2/8/21)</h2>



<p>There was a miscommunication between myself and the editor with regards to the performance claims of Zen 4. The only thing that we are claiming with any level of certainty is the claim of a Genoa ES sample being 29% faster then Milan at the same clocks.</p>



<p>We apologise for any confusion this may have caused.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
	
	
	
	<div>
		<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>What made me interested in Clojure was Datomic, I was dealing with a problem at my work and the Datomic idea of insert only with timestamp would easily solve it, I took it as inspiration and did something similar using PostgreSQL. While I was looking and learning about Datomic, I find out some Rich Rickey videos, some of them with Clojure, and well… he got me, I wanted to see all that immutability stuff, and also LISP, I don’t even remember reading much more than a paragraph of LISP at college. “Simple, made easy”.</p>
<p>Then I would be trying something completely different from what I was used to, in the worst case scenario I would be wasting some hours, but I already watched Game of Thrones last season, so I’m quite used to it.</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The How</h2>
<p>Well, at the official Clojure website you have this almost <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started">nothing</a> of documentation. It’s just a small introduction of the language. You pretty much have to buy a book or take a look at <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/">Brave Clojure</a> free book, it’s truly great, you will have a better overview of the language. I was feeling great after finishing the book, Clojure, LISP, the possibility of writing (-&gt; Macros (never had to touch them (are they even KISS compliant?(wonder if people tried to do some smart things with it)))) such an elegant way of writing.</p>
<h2 id="the-try-to-do">The (Try To) Do</h2>
<p>So I had an idea of a little project for fun, so why not do it in Clojure?
It should be a back-end REST API, which would query and treat and save and transform some government open data with a separated front-end that would ask and display the data.<br>
Easy, I thought, Clojure is quite simple.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.giovanialtelino.com/a-year-clojure/clojure_wall.jpg" alt="the clojure wall"></p>
<p>Well, that wasn’t the case, I hitted a wall, took much longer than I expected, debugging was confusing, at best.
The little errors were annoying, and hard to track, messages were weird, documentation scarce too. I didn’t track the hours, but it took me way longer than I expected.</p>
<p>And the same happened on my second project, which had no front-end but a more complex back-end, the idea would be offer some covid data to be easily accessible to the Zulip Clojure group, but I took too much time and didn’t finished in time for them to use on their project. To be fair, I was quite stressed at the time, mostly due to the state of the world with Covid, and I didn’t work every single day on it.</p>
<p>In those projects I had to move a lot of maps between functions, I understand that Clojure dynamic typing offers the possibility to create maps to move stuff around on the fly, but I think that if they were static typed it would be much easier to have better control over them. I know there are specs to “filter” the data and I didn’t use them, so you can blame me.
I also don’t really see the appeal on specs, because you kinda create an model to follow, wouldn’t it break the dynamic typing idea and without the benefits of a static typed language?</p>
<p>Finally, the grand finale, my best project, my Hacker News clone.<br>
I had the excellent idea to throw a lot of stuff there, GraphQL, JWT, re-frame, Datomic, yep, Datomic with GraphQL. It was quite interesting to finally work with Datomic (remember, this is what brought me here).
But again, I had some issues, first I was using the wrong Datomic Client, that took some time for me to realize, it was also hard do debug the GraphQL queries, as much as the REST ones, and I hit another issue that you can’t query recursively nested items in Graphql, great, don’t remember reading about it in any GraphQL tutorial or introduction I read, re-frame was mostly easy though, I don’t have any complain about it.
This project even ended in the <a href="https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia/commit/c54e5a3665562c8e6cd76eda25357d1cd19c1320">Lacinia Official Wiki</a>, I just found out because I have Google Analytics and saw some direct access from Lacinia Docs,I use it just for my curiosity of how many have been here (oh, hello visitor).</p>
<h2 id="the-not-work">The (Not) Work</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/l9dx1j/stop_selling_clojure_as_just_a_learning_experience/">Some people</a> get annoyed that Clojure is recommended mostly as a learning exercise, while I’ve seen some job offers, I ended up failing at them.<br>
I’m in Brazil, Clojure here is mostly (if not only) Nubank, your experience may vary, but at Nubank I got rejected at the first step at the two times I tried, so there is pretty much no work for me locally. I wonder if it’s the lack of developers options, the hard learning curve, LISP, or something else, but no other company looks to be interested in Clojure here.</p>
<p>I ended up getting two, remote, interviews anyways, one due to my Hacker News project, a person called me on Reddit and we started to talk, that was quite nice, since I wasn’t even looking for a job at the time, but anyways, it didn’t work out. And another one in january 2021, which I was looking for. And well, I failed miserably in the technical test, which was quite shocking for myself.<br>
I had four hours to develop a project, and I managed to finish something like 20% of it, I really don’t remember falling any other test as bad as this one, again I had to move and deal with a lot of maps with data, and some file IO operations. I got quite curious if it was too hard, maybe I suck. <br>
But for the sake of my own curiosity, I decided to do the project again using C#, completed in three hours and a half with tests, using C# channels to process the data, which is slightly more complex and take some extra time, I wasn’t even using core.async in the Clojure one.</p>
<h2 id="the-trap-repl">The (Trap) Repl</h2>
<p>The REPL, one of the most loved Clojure tools, when I was doing Clojure development I used it a lot too, all the time, some people call this Repl Driven Development. Only after the test that I failed, and succeeded in C#, I realized, it may be a trap.<br>
It’s nice to prototype some small stuff in the REPL, but it is a waste of time to test and debug in the REPL, and I was testing in the REPL all the time, I was wasting a lot of time all this time without realizing it. Maybe I need more than 20 years of experience.<br>
I’m not even talking about the “real” TDD, that you write your tests before you write your code, I write most of my tests after I wrote my methods and functions, but write the tests in file, and run it with a simple a unique command, all the 10 or more of them, quickly, easily, done.<br>
Debug? Easy, simple, I can easily track back all my objects, and data, line by line.</p>
<p>While simple Clojure is indeed easy, the not so simple is too complex, it escalates too quickly.</p>
<h2 id="the-clojure-future">The Clojure Future</h2>
<p>Nubank bought Cognitec last year, and should inject some cash in Clojure, unless you are a banking competitor I would see it as good news (keep in mind that Rich is still the Clojure owner, so theoretically, even banks should be fine) it’s nice to have a big company behind your OSS, I know there is a lot of talk about “Clojure dying” but it’s hard to predict, as I said, your experience may and will vary, search your job market and most tech take a long time to die, anyways.</p>
<h2 id="the-experience-and-the-learning">The Experience And The Learning</h2>
<p>It was a nice experience, dealing recursively with immutable data with dynamic types.<br>
Now I find to be weird when I have to update a lot of objects after starting them, happily C# introduced Record, which are immutable objects, and I’m using it when possible. I also end more open minded about new languages or ideas, but still more pragmatic after the issues with the Repl.<br>
I believe that knowledge is never a waste, of course you could be doing something to earn you more money, but as long as it’s something that makes you happy and doesn’t hurt you in the long run, I’m fine with it.<br>
And at the end of the day, I would say I’ve become a better programmer, with broader knowledge, so it was worth it.</p>
<h2 id="my-future">My Future</h2>
<p>Well, it has been a nice ride. My Clojure journey has come to an end, at least for now.<br>
But it was a interesting experience, and I’m planning to look deeper in a new language yearly, just for the knowledge, I just haven’t decided what I’ll be doing, I think I should go deeper with functional languages and look at Haskell or maybe F#.</p>

<![CDATA[A Poetic Apology: Or Why Should You Use Poetry to Manage Python Dependencies]]>
            </title>

February 10, 2021 | https://muttdata.ai/blog/2020/08/21/a-poetic-apology.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://muttdata.ai/blog/2020/08/21/a-poetic-apology.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>If you ever spent some time trying to write a Python application you have probably
experienced Python’s Infamous Dependency Hell at some point. You’ve probably also
gathered by now that it has become a folk tradition to start any piece about such subject
with the following notorious <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">xkcd comic</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://muttdata.ai/blog/img/posts/poetry_apology/xkcd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Luckily for you (and all of us) at the time of writing, there are some good solutions to
the entanglement of pains brilliantly depicted in the image above. In fact, you most likely
already know that if you want to develop against multiple Python versions you can readily
use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to start unraveling your twisted environment.
You might have also learned that if you happen to be working at the same time on multiple
projects with conflicting dependencies then you can employ <em>virtual environments</em> to
isolate clashing libraries. In this document, we’ll introduce yet another tool,
<a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a>, and make an argument about why you
should probably add it to your own toolkit.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Imagine one lonely night you decide to start a simple dummy Python project accurately
named <code>foo</code> with the following structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code>├── foo
│   ├── foo
│   │   ├── bar
│   │   │   └── data.py
│   │   └── constants.py
│   └── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since this is not your first Python project and you want to avoid spending more endless
nights fixing incompatibilities between your system and project modules, you diligently
initiate a virtual environment from your shell with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and activate it within the newly created project with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Equipped with an isolated environment, you triumphantly proceed to install the ubiquitous
Pandas data library. To achieve such thing you use Python’s de-facto package manager
<code>pip</code> and carefully pin the library version to ensure replicability</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>0.25.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since you are a bit lazy at doing exploratory data analysis, you also install the nifty
<code>pandas-profiling</code> module to help you with that tedious work</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span>pandas-profiling<span>==</span>2.5.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After all this flirting, you finally start coding (assuming that adding the
following lines to the <code>data.py</code> file can, in fact, be called that)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pandas_profiling</span> <span>import</span> <span>ProfileReport</span>
<span>df</span><span>=</span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>([[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>],[</span><span>'b'</span><span>,</span><span>None</span><span>]],</span><span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>,</span> <span>'value'</span><span>])</span>
<span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>]</span><span>=</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>].</span><span>astype</span><span>(</span><span>'category'</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span><span>==</span><span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span><span>ProfileReport</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>).</span><span>to_file</span><span>(</span><span>'foo.html'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given that your days of abusing <code>print</code> statements for debugging purposes are long gone,
you install the beautiful and handy <a href="https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp">pdbpp</a> library to
check that these lines work as intended</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pdbpp</span><span>==</span>0.10.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and run your code in <em>post mortem debugging mode</em> with <code>python -m pdb -cc data.py</code>.</p>

<p>Happy with the clean run, you now realize that in order to ship your voluptuous application
without falling into the “works on my machine” trap you need a way to collect all your
dependencies. A quick Google search will show you that pip’s <code>freeze</code> subcommand allows to
record the current environment package into a <code>requirements.txt</code> file by means of the
following incantation</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which lets anyone use your project by simply installing the needed dependencies with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just as you are about to reveal your masterpiece project to the world, you become aware
that the improved debugging module is actually only used by you while developing. With the
idea of splitting the frozen requirements into separate production and development files,
you take a peek into the generated file only to discover that each and every
single sub-dependency of your application’s dependencies is listed therein and locked to a
specific version. Foreseeing the nightmare of maintaining this immense list you uninstall
the <code>pdbpp</code> library to ensure a clean requirements file again by means of</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip uninstall <span>-y</span> pdbpp <span>&amp;&amp;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A quick glance at the modified requirements file, however, shows that things didn’t quite
turn out as expected: <code>pdbpp</code> was indeed removed but its dependencies, such as
<code>fancycompleter</code>, are still installed. Since this seems a dead-end, you choose to start
from scratch by manually creating a <code>requirements.txt</code> file with only production
dependencies</p>

<pre><code>pandas==0.25.3
pandas-profiling==2.5.0
</code></pre>

<p>and an equivalent development file, <code>requirements_dev.txt</code>, solely containing</p>

<pre><code>pdbpp==0.10.2
</code></pre>

<p>Impressed by the cleverness that has seemingly helped you dodge the dreaded Python
dependency hell by keeping a record of isolated top-level packages, you decide to call it a
day and give a final spin to your application the next day.</p>

<p>When you wake up in the morning, the news are all over the place: Pandas v1 is
finally out (after only twelve years!). A couple of hours procrastinating with the
incredibly long changelog makes you conclude that your complex foo-project
will surely gain notable improvements by updating to the brand new version. Now since
you’ve locked Pandas to an exact version, you cannot simply run</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-U</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead you must execute</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>1.0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which leads to a particularly bizarre and confusing situation: an error pops in your
terminal</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: pandas-profiling 2.5.0 has requirement pandas==0.25.3, but you'll have pandas 1.0.0 which is incompatible.
</code></pre>

<p>but the installation of <code>pandas 1.0.0</code> nonetheless takes place. Assuming this to be a warning
that <code>pip</code> mistakes for an error, you update your <code>requirements.txt</code> file accordingly and
joyfully proceed to run your <code>data.py</code> module one last time, only to discover that it throws
an enigmatic <code>TypeError</code>. Feeling now betrayed by pip’s apparent inability to resolve
dependencies, you rollback your changes and stick with Pandas’ (now) outdated version.</p>

<p>At this point, you seem to have a working project but i) you are unsure whether reverting
Pandas version might have broken the desired replicability of your application, ii) the
code could definitely look better and iii) after a good night’s sleep you acknowledge that
the overall functionality of your application is not as complex and rich as you thought it
was the night before. To address the first two issues, you first add the <code>black</code> formatter
to your <code>requirements_dev.txt</code></p>

<pre><code>black==19.10b0
</code></pre>

<p>and then within your project directory, you recreate your virtual environment with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>rm</span> <span>-rf</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements_dev.txt
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you run <code>black</code> in your project root (with <code>black .</code>) and are mostly satisfied with
the prettifying job it did but to abide by Mutt Data’s format style (which is coincidentally
consistent with your dislike of making every single quote a double quote), you add a
<code>pyproject.toml</code> telling <code>black</code> to skip such appalling string normalization default
setting</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[tool.black]</span>
<span>skip-string-normalization</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code looks great now and a new post mortem debugging run shows that things seem to work
fine in the new (replicable) environment. The only thing left to be done before deploying
the code on the server or sharing it with the world is to avoid having constants, such as
the report name, hardcoded all around the code. You thus
decide to add the following lines to your <code>constants.py</code> empty module</p>



<p>and modify the <code>data.py</code> to import such constant from the relative parent file with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>..constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A new <code>data.py</code> run however now, unfortunately, shows the next error</p>

<pre><code>ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
</code></pre>

<p>which according to the omniscient SO makes sense since Python relative imports only work
within a package and therefore if you want to import from a parent directory you should
either create such package or hack the <code>sys.path</code>. As a true purist pythonista, you pick
the former path and create a <code>setup.py</code> with the following contents</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>setuptools</span> <span>import</span> <span>setup</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>install_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements_dev.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>extras_dev_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>

<span>setup</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>version</span><span>=</span><span>'0.0.1'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author</span><span>=</span><span>'Mutt'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author_email</span><span>=</span><span>'info@muttdata.ai'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>install_requires</span><span>=</span><span>install_requires</span><span>,</span>
    <span>extras_require</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'dev'</span><span>:</span> <span>extras_dev_requires</span><span>},</span>
    <span>packages</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'foo'</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in a brand new virtual env you install your package in editable mode with <code>pip install
-e .[dev]</code>, change the import line in <code>data.py</code> to account for the package structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>foo.constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and cross your fingers hoping everything finally works…</p>

<p>Everything does indeed (brittlely) work, but somehow all the hoop-jumping to make it
function makes you uneasy. A brief introspection reveals several reasons for the wave of
apprehension:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since you plan to work on multiples Python projects at the same time, isolation is a
fundamental piece of your workflow. Virtual environments do solve this problem, but
the activate/deactivate process is cumbersome and easy to forget.</li>
  <li>Having dependencies isolated between projects doesn’t address dependency clash within a
project. Proper dependency resolution is the top required feature of any package
manager worthy of respect yet <code>pip</code> will only get such feature by October 2020.
Manually guaranteeing dependency consistency in complex projects is a deadlock.</li>
  <li>If you want to install your application/project as a package, you must go through the
overhead of adding a <code>setup.py</code> on top of your already multiple requirements files.
However, you’ve read PEPs 517-518 and want to try out the simpler and safer build
mechanisms mentioned therein.</li>
  <li>You thought about trying your application on a different machine, but realized it ran
Python 3.7 while your local box runs 3.8. To use <code>pyenv</code> with your isolated virtual
envs, you need an extra plugin,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv">pyenv-virtualenv</a>, which makes managing
venvs even more burdensome.</li>
  <li>You briefly played with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv">Pipenv</a> which promised to
bring …</li></ol></div></div></div>

Shopify has its own portion of false retailers and fraudulent activity. Here is how to stay safe when using Shopify</strong>.</p>
<p>Ecommerce platforms made it possible for small businesses to have a wider market and reach customers beyond their location and borders through their online stores. At the same time, it made it possible for shoppers to find all sorts of new products with well-organized dropshipping and ease of use that the Shopify platform, eBay, Amazon, and other ecommerce websites offer.</p>
<p>But there are two signs to every coin. The bad news is that store owners and shoppers canâ€™t always escape fraudsters on these platforms. The good news is that <strong>e-commerce platforms have thorough vetting systems and a vast community that shares reviews</strong>, so itâ€™s easy to know the schemes and patterns of ecommerce stores that scam people.</p>
<p>In this article, weâ€™ll focus mainly on Shopify scams. To learn more about the platformâ€™s ins and outs, check out this guide on <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/wix-vs-shopify">Shopify vs Wix</a>, as well as this <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/shopify-payments">detailed article on Shopify Payments</a>. Now, letâ€™s dig in into Shopify Store scams.</p>
</div><div id="types-of-scams-on-shopify"><h2>Types of scams on Shopify</h2>
<p>In the last year, Shopify <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/shopify-positions-itself-as-the-coronavirus-and-beyond-platform/">became the most popular ecommerce platform</a> for both shoppers and retailers to keep their business afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. It unveiled many features and updates to help users have a better experience, from <strong>better algorithms</strong> to a <strong>longer trial period</strong> and <strong>know how resources for new users</strong>. Naturally, this also seemed to attract more fraudsters.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more efficient schemes you should know about.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/tsrsH8jBRLQSSo2z0Syw" alt="la20.48 infographic.png"></p>
<h3>Triangulation scheme</h3>
<p>One of the smartest and most enduring schemes on Shopify and other ecommerce platforms is the so-called triangulation scheme.</p>
<p>Basically, fraudsters create an active Shopify store and market themselves as selling proper products. They then <strong>buy products from online suppliers, acting as the middleman</strong> in shipping the merchandise to the shoppersâ€™ addresses (which is exactly how dropshipping works).</p>
<p>But, hereâ€™s the catch: they buy the merchandise from the suppliers with previously stolen cards. The credit card company will <strong>reject the transaction and initiate a chargeback on Shopify</strong>. When a chargeback occurs, <strong>Shopify doesnâ€™t return the money to the seller, hence they lose both the product and the money</strong>.</p>
<p>The triangulation scheme was especially on the rise in 2016 when the Pokemon Go game came out. Lots of fake stores claimed to sell this game and managed to scam a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Shopify Store duplicator scheme</h3>
<p>The duplicator scheme is so simple, yet itâ€™s hard to believe people can pull it off. Basically, scammers find recently created Shopify Stores and <strong>create one with a similar domain name, claiming to sell the same original product</strong>. All sorts of products have been â€œmirroredâ€� on similar web addresses, from original merchandise t-shirts to branded teabags.</p>
<p>The most famous example of this scheme is when scammers created a duplicate store to Mike Lindellâ€™s MyPillow store with a domain name mypillow.com. In 2018, the merchant noticed a twin storefront to his, registered under the domain name mypillowstore.com. Lindell sued Shopify for failing to spot the scamming sites and bigcommerce trademark infringement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shopify took down the fake storefront and added more software tools that cost $30 and up and offer monthly maintenance for merchantsâ€™ transactions. They also have more tech teams dedicated to combing out the fake Shopify sites.</p>
<h3>Switching scheme</h3>
<p>This is one of the more serious schemes since it causes a long-term loss with sellers. It has been prevalent in e-commerce platforms such as eBay before. Basically, what happens is that <strong>a potential buyer will make a purchase on your Shopify store and request a direct invoice from you straight from PayPal</strong>. As a reason for this, they will say they have difficulty and canâ€™t finish a payment because of technical issues on the platform.</p>
<p>After you send them an invoice, <strong>you will get a notification that is allegedly from PayPal</strong>, but actually fake, <strong>that the buyer has paid and is waiting for the product tracking number</strong>. Until you give them the tracking number, <strong>â€œPayPalâ€� checkout has the funds on hold</strong>. Naturally, if a seller falls for the trick, the scammer will get the products for free, since there is no PayPal holding the funds. If weâ€™re talking about a big shipment or a very expensive product, as a seller, you could lose a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Direct Client scheme</h3>
<p>This scam takes some sweet-talking scammers. Basically, a buyer makes a purchase that goes well, and the products are at the right shipping address on time. Then, when <strong>the seller gains the buyerâ€™s trust</strong>, they make a suggestion that next time they should skip the whole hassle and extra costs on Shopify, and <strong>go straight to a direct card payment technique</strong>. Of course, then they have the credit card digits and data, so they can exhaust the buyerâ€™s fund. The buyer, needless to say, doesnâ€™t get the goods this time.</p>
<h3>Fake return ticket</h3>
<p>Yet another slow-burning, but effective method of scamming is the counterfeited return ticket fraud. In this scenario, a buyer purchases goods once. Then they decide to purchase a <strong>similar, but a slightly cheaper product</strong>. <strong>They request a return on the first purchase</strong>, citing the product that was received looks different from the pictures or there is something wrong with it. Then, <strong>they return the second, similar but cheaper product</strong>, which enables them to get the money for the first product back and also keep the good and more expensive product.</p>
<h3>Fake Purchase order</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>scam that requires the most technical knowledge and software skills</strong> to be performed. So itâ€™s rarer but extremely effective, and youâ€™d still need to be wary.  Basically, a scammer that is in the position of a customer will <strong>create a copy of the sellerâ€™s Shopify checkout sheet</strong> in their drive <strong>and alter the submit button link</strong>. Then, they will patch it to their  PHP software or program that enables saving all data saved from your checkout. Afterward, they will modify the data they received and adjust it to send the fake checkout sheet back, at a lower price. You wonâ€™t notice the difference in price without knowing itâ€™s doctored, and approve the transaction.</p>
<p>This scam allows the fraudsters to <strong>get products without the sellerâ€™s consent or with it but for a smaller price</strong>, and before the seller realizes that something is going on they can lose a whole shipmentâ€™s worth of money.</p>
<p>If they donâ€™t successfully doctor the purchase sheet, they have a good plan B: asking for a chargeback, which will still make the seller lose money.</p>
</div><div id="how-to-report-scams"><h2>How to report scams</h2>
<p>As a customer, you can report fraudulent activity or bad experience with a merchant here. The list covers many situations, <strong>from non-delivery of a sold item to restricted items and illegal activity</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/hEpxaGdTRRmNYcmAehnn" alt="report an issue shopify.png"></p>
<p>However, if youâ€™re on the other side of the selling process and being scammed by a customer, apart from having a premium Shopify web store with all maintenance services, itâ€™s mostly up to you to stay careful.</p>
<p>Choosing a secure payment gateway and having a single place for all your transactions with Shopify payments is helpful.</p>
<p>Also, itâ€™s safe to save proof of your transactions, by making screenshots of your communication and transactions that you can later use to prove your case when reporting scams.</p>
<p>Lastly, itâ€™s fair to mention that <strong>Shopify</strong>, no matter the many measures they take with battling scammers, <strong>is still swarming with fraudulent activity</strong>. You can check out the <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Reporting-a-scam-store/td-p/644505">discussion board</a> for more info on other possible scams and ways to battle it.</p>

Label your data wrong, and your model learns the wrong insights about the world. It may seem simple to get properly labeled data, but anyone who’s spent even a little time in data science knows that good data is hard to come by. There are dozens of things that can go wrong, from loose labels, incorrectly formatted data, outliers, and more.</p><p id="3676">Labeling data is hard to get right. The seemingly trivial task to “draw bounding boxes around the animals” can have numerous outcomes, depending on the human performing the task.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2302/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg" width="1151" height="255" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>(Left) One bounding box around the animals.

(Source: Author and European Wilderness Society)</figcaption></figure><p id="0a96">Even experts might disagree on how data <em>should</em> be labeled due to a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359178" rel="noopener nofollow">variety of factors</a>. These difficulties make curating data one of the most expensive and time consuming stages in ML development. Guidelines need to be clearly defined and constantly redefined to build a highly accurate, production machine learning model.</p><p id="6a1f">It takes time to apply our human expertise and understanding of the world to individual data points. Every label captures our understanding at the time of labeling. Every action is a product of the data points we’ve seen before. The more we see, the more we understand the landscape of our data.</p><p id="72e3">Our understanding changes over time, and the dynamic nature of our data affects how we need to manage it. In order for our datasets to be reliable and trustworthy, we need to version them, iterate on them, and evaluate the effects of our changes on our model’s predictions.</p><p id="e5d6">For such a crucial step in the machine learning loop, we have very few tools and platforms that focus exclusively on data labeling and data management. Even fewer are open source.</p><p id="5b5f">Worst of all, none of them seem to have strong data versioning and data lineage baked into them. That means mistakes are much harder to correct, and as we’ve already seen that mistakes are virtually inevitable in labeling pipelines. You need a quick way to go back in time and correct mistakes or branch off to try a new strategy for getting those tricky labeling tasks right.</p><p id="4330">That’s why in this blog I’m going to help you bring together two powerful open source machine learning platforms to help you get your labeling right. In this article we’ll combine the labeling prowess of <a href="https://labelstud.io/" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Label Studio</strong></a> and the robust data versioning and lineage capabilities of <a href="https://pachdm.com/3a0uOfh" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Pachyderm</strong></a>.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1800/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif" width="900" height="500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Label Studio annotation examples (Source: Label Studio)</figcaption></figure><p id="bea5"><a href="https://labelstud.io/" rel="noopener nofollow">Label Studio</a> is an open source data labeling environment for image, audio, text, time series, and many other data types.

It gives you an immutable, copy-on-write file system that fronts on object stores like S3, which allows you to keep all changes to your data as they happen. It also keeps track of the journey of that data, recording a git-style commit with each transformation that allows you to roll out and roll back every single step of your data transformation from beginning to end.</p><p id="9293">What makes Pachyderm unique among all other ML platforms is that immutable file layer. It keeps every single change to your data. Other versioning systems are limited because they don’t enforce immutability, which can easily leave you in a bad state when your underlying data changes. Imagine you overwrote a bunch of your labeled images with new labels and didn’t save the originals. Now every single experiment that points to the original set of files can no longer be recreated. The commits point to a state that doesn’t exist. Pachyderm keeps every change and that means you can always roll back in time if you find an earlier version of your files was the one you really need to train your production model right.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3742/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg" width="1871" height="883" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Diagram of the label studio integration. Label Studio is using Pachyderm’s S3 gateway as the source and target locations for raw and labeled data respectively. (Source: Image by author)</figcaption></figure><p id="9561">Combining these two platforms is straightforward. We use Label Studio to interact with data that gets stored and versioned in Pachyderm. Pachyderm handles changes submitted to it from Label Studio, versioning them and running pipelines to kick off new training iterations in your machine learning loop.</p><p id="88bd"><strong>Label Studio</strong>’s<a href="https://labelstud.io/blog/release-070-cloud-storage-enablement.html" rel="noopener nofollow"> cloud storage interoperability</a> means that Label Studio can read data from and write labeled data to cloud storage. We can configure Label Studio to read source data from an Amazon S3 bucket, automatically pulling in new data to be labeled whenever it’s added to the bucket. We can also write our annotated data to a “target” S3 bucket, still retaining a reference to the original data.</p><p id="3d93"><strong>Pachyderm</strong> does many powerful things to manage and version data, while also providing a clean <a href="https://pachdm.com/2N35a0q" rel="noopener nofollow">S3 gateway</a>. This means we can treat Pachyderm as a cloud storage system. When we put files into Pachyderm’s “buckets” (versioned data repositories), we are actually committing files to be versioned. Versioned files ensure that if we delete or change a file in Pachyderm, the new state of the bucket reflects the change, while the old file still exists in a previous commit that can always be recovered.</p><p id="152d">Label Studio continually pulls new data from its source bucket, so whenever we commit data to our source repository in Pachyderm, Label Studio imports it as tasks to be labeled. After a task is completed (labeled), Label Studio writes the completion to our target bucket location, which commits the completion file to the target data repository.</p><p id="f83c">Later, If we decide to change a task’s label, Label Studio modifies the existing completion file. Pachyderm treats this change as a new commit to our labeled data repository, giving us a record of any changes that were made.</p><p id="9461">In a more mature use case, we would also use Pachyderm’s repository branches, so we can iterate on our data in a development branch without impacting pipelines that may depend on the master branch of our labeled data. This serves a highly useful purpose, allowing us to test a new version of our dataset before releasing/promoting it as the master version.</p><h2 id="3fbc">Run It Yourself</h2><p id="cfef">Find a full example of Label Studio configurations for Pachyderm in this <a href="https://pachdm.com/36U10iG" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub repo</a>. The example configurations show you how to incorporate Label Studio for labeling text data for a sentiment classification task, but can easily be extended and configured for any labeling project. You can also add Pachyderm pipelines for pre-processing or even to <a href="https://pachdm.com/3jtyQ2M" rel="noopener nofollow">automate data ingestion</a>. The general setup requires:</p><p id="3b1d">1. Give Label Studio access to Pachyderm. Generate a Pachyderm security token (not necessary if running locally), configure the S3 gateway endpoint, and create an <a href="https://pachdm.com/3p1Aaey" rel="noopener nofollow">environment file</a> with the configuration. A sample .env file is shown below:</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Example .env file for configuring the Endpoint URL.</figcaption></figure><p id="58b8">2. Edit the source and target buckets in the Label Studio configuration to point to the Pachyderm versioned data repositories. The bucket names follow the convention <code>&lt;repo_branch&gt;.&lt;data_repo&gt;/&lt;file_name&gt;</code> . An example configuration is shown below.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Label Studio config with Pachyderm’s S3 backend.</figcaption></figure><p id="86d6">Data labeling and data versioning provide a rock solid bedrock to build your machine learning models on now and in the future. On their own, versioning and labeling are useful but when you bring them together, Label Studio and Pachyderm can dramatically increase the efficiency and dependability of the labeling cycle in your machine learning loop. That means better models, faster and more reliably and that’s what every data science team on the planet is pushing towards. The stronger their foundation, the more they can focus on making their models better rather than wrangling data.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Both will help you to make something people want. At Raycast, we’re obsessed with user feedback. We read and answer each message that we receive. We value it more than metrics, and it’s one of our ways to collaborate with our community to shape Raycast.</p><blockquote><p><em>"Amazing response speed. You are the only app I write feedback for. You are actually listening and helping."</em> - by <a href="https://twitter.com/antoniostoilkov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Antonio Stoilkov</a></p></blockquote><p>For us being obsessed with user feedback doesn’t mean to collect and instantly forget about it. It means treating feedback as a conversation, act on it and close the loop. In this post, I’ll outline how we run our feedback loop at Raycast and what we’ve learned so far.</p><h2 id="make-it-easy-to-reach-you">Make it easy to reach you</h2><p>It should be easy and quick for a user to send feedback. Nobody wants to go through a five-step questionnaire to report a small bug. Instead, we provide a command to send feedback from within Raycast. During onboarding, we hint the <em>Send Feedback</em> command to new users to make sure they know how to contact us.</p><p>The command is a simple form with a plain text description and an optional email address. We don’t differentiate bugs, feature requests or general feedback. This is on purpose. We want to make it as seamless as possible to reach us. The email allows us to respond, ask follow-up questions and keep a history of previous submissions. </p><p>In addition to our built-in feedback form, we use our <a href="https://raycast.com/community" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Slack community</a> to collect feedback. Usually, users join our community after they’ve used the app for a few days. They are motivated to exchange ideas and Slack makes it easy to add more context. However, communication in Slack is different. People expect quick responses, and it’s no-longer a 1-to-1 conversation. Other community members can chirp in to upvote feedback or provide answers. Played well, this can foster a feeling of belonging.</p><p>Slack offers direct messages which are great to deepen the relationship with your power-users. I chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/tholanda" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thiago</a>, one of our early community members, at least once a week. Many ideas pop up during these chats. One idea was to generate the documentation of our <a href="https://github.com/raycast/script-commands" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">script commands</a>. Eventually, Thiago went ahead and built it himself. This isn’t so much about bug reports or feature requests any more. This is more about how can community members contribute from the outside to Raycast. And this benefits the community as a whole.</p><p>There is a caveat of having a community on Slack: People expect quick responses which can easily distract the team. For this, we’ve introduced an on-call rotation to sort out and respond to feedback.</p><h2 id="act-on-feedback">Act on feedback</h2><p>Each week, another person of the team reads, filters and replies to every piece of feedback. All messages from the app get send to a shared inbox in <a href="http://frontapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Front</a>. This allows the on-call to collaborate with the feature owner on a response. Additionally, we persist each feedback to a database in <a href="http://airtable.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airtable</a>. This allows us to query it later. </p><p>At the beginning, we sent everything in real-time to a Slack channel. It turned out that this was very distracting for our team. Now, we batch the feedback of the last 24 hours in a daily digest. The digest is automatically posted in the morning. This way, everybody can stay on top of the received feedback without getting distracted throughout the day. It’s important to us, that every team member has access to the feedback for two reasons: </p><ol><li>Feature owners should know when something is broken in order to decide if it should be fixed in the next release, or if a fix can be prioritized later.</li><li>The constant stream of feedback makes us aware of what’s missing, which then influences our work for the next month (<a href="https://raycast.com/blog/focus-document" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">See previous blog post about how we plan our work</a>). </li></ol><p>Some of our most-used features are based on feedback from our community members. For example, many users asked for a global hotkey to toggle the clipboard history. They were used to it from other apps. After hearing this feedback over and over again, we addressed it in a generic way. Now, users can assign global hotkeys to perform a command or open an app. </p><h2 id="close-the-loop-with-the-sender">Close the loop with the sender</h2><p>Don’t treat feedback as one way! When somebody takes the time to send you a bug report or suggest a new feature, you should respond. Our on-call’s job is to respond to feedback within 48 hours, even quicker in Slack. We want to make our users feel heard and encourage them to keep providing feedback. </p><p>It’s crucial to be honest with your users. If we receive a suggestion that we won’t build, we let them know. We want to set the right expectations. If they share our opinion and adopt the tool, that’s great. If they stop using the tool, that’s fine as well. You can’t build for everyone but you can stay flexible. We declined some suggestions initially, and after they came up more often, we decided to build them anyway. </p><blockquote><p><em>"Awesome shipping tempo, keep it up!"</em> - by <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lovin</a></p></blockquote><p>In addition to responding to the feedback directly, we have a few other mechanisms to close the loop. We keep a <a href="https://raycast.com/changelog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">changelog</a> that lists new features, improvements and bug fixes for each update. We share each changelog entry in our <a href="https://raycast.com/community" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Slack community</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/raycastapp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. This makes it easy to follow our progress on the channels that our users already use. And for the folks that prefer email, we send a semi-regular newsletter that highlights recently released features and other tips.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://raycast.com/blog/focus-document" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">previous blog post</a>, we don’t keep a backlog or have a roadmap.  We try to stay flexible to fulfil the needs of our users. The user feedback guides us what to build in the short term. Our limited set of metrics help us go in the right direction in the long term.</p><p>A working feedback loop is based on trust. The quicker you address a bug report, reply to a feature suggestion or answer a support question, the more trust you gain. You build more trust with every positive interaction, and at some point you have collected enough to become friends with your user. And if that happens, you won somebody that cheers for you and spreads the word about you but also tells you when you screwed up.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>
<h2 id="update12feb2021">Update (12 Feb 2021)</h2>
<p>It took 27 days, but the eBook has now reached the milestone of 10k USD in sales! Most of the purchases being made now are from links on the OpenFaaS website, the faasd repo or my own blog. This is also known as long-tail, a slow and steady stream of revenue.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2021/02/update-rev6.png" alt="Launch event, offers and longtail"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visualised: Launch event, offers and longtail</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've also released revision 6 of the eBook which has a much more detailed section on CI/CD and recipes for multi-arch builds. I'm using it to deploy endpoints directly to my Raspberry Pi from GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how Serverless functions can be of use for your next side-project or idea, why not try the eBook and / or video workshop? You can get your money back within 7 days if you're not satisfied.</p>
<p>Events and webhooks can be used to build custom extensions for SaaS products or existing systems. You can see an example in my <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">gumroad-responder</a> which forwards messages to Slack, and sends emails via AWS SES to customers during a promotion.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo Simulations are a series of experiments that help us understand the probability of different outcomes when the intervention of random variables is present. It’s a technique you can use to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.</p>



<p>Although Monte Carlo Methods can be studied and applied in many ways, we’re going to focus on:</p>



<ul><li>What Monte Carlo Simulation/Method actually is, along with some examples and few experiments.</li><li>Simulating the game of <em>Roulette</em> with methods of Monte Carlo and inferential statistics.</li><li>Understanding areas where it finds its application other than gambling.</li></ul>



<h2>Why should you learn about Monte Carlo Simulation?</h2>



<p>Monte Carlo Simulations utilize something called the Monte Carlo Sampling technique, which is randomly sampling a probability distribution. We’re going to see a simulation based around this technique later in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since business and finance are plagued by random variables, Monte Carlo simulations have a vast array of potential applications in these fields. They’re used to estimate the probability of cost overruns in large projects, and the likelihood that an asset price will move in a certain way.</p>



<p>Telecoms use them to assess network performance in different scenarios, helping them to optimize the network. Analysts use them to assess the risk that an entity will default, and to analyze derivatives such as options.</p>



<p>Insurers and oil well drillers also use them. Monte Carlo simulations have countless applications outside of business and finance, such as in meteorology, astronomy, and particle physics.</p>



<p>In machine learning, Monte Carlo methods provide the basis for resampling techniques like the <em>bootstrap method</em> for estimating a quantity, such as the accuracy of a model on a limited dataset.</p>



<blockquote><p>The bootstrap method is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement.</p></blockquote>



<h2>History</h2>



<p>A mathematician who goes by the name Stanislaw Ulam started playing solitaire while recovering from an illness. He wondered what’s the probability of winning this game. So, he spent a lot of time trying to work the odds and combinatorics of the game, but despite being a great mathematician (he also took part in the Manhattan project), he failed! Which you can understand if you’ve played solitaire. There are tons of combinations which makes the combinatorial calculation super complicated.</p>



<p>To tackle this he thought of going the experimental route, counting the number of hands won / number of hands played. But he had already played a lot of hands without a win, so it would take him years to play enough hands to actually get a good estimate. So instead of playing all the hands, he thought of simulating the game on the computer.</p>



<p>He consulted his computer geek friend John von Neumann, who agreed on running the experiment on his new ENIAC machine, which would take a couple of hours to run the experiments (microseconds for a machine this age). And thus, Monte Carlo Simulation was born!</p>



<h2>What is Monte Carlo Simulation?</h2>



<p>Monte Carlo Simulation is a method of estimating the value of an unknown quantity using the principles of <strong>inferential statistics</strong>.</p>



<p>Inferential statistics corresponds to applying statistical algorithms on a sample/random variable, drawn from a sample that tends to exhibit the same properties as the population (from which it is drawn).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="860" height="400" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Monte-Carlo-Simulation.jpeg?resize=860%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="Monte Carlo Simulation" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Monte-Carlo-Simulation.jpeg?w=860&amp;ssl=1 860w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Monte-Carlo-Simulation.jpeg?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Monte-Carlo-Simulation.jpeg?resize=768%2C357&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Source: original image</em></p>



<p>In the case of solitaire, the population is the universe of all possible games of solitaire which could be possibly played, and the sample is the games we played (&gt;1). Now, the inferential statistics tells you that we can make inferences about the population based on the statistics we do on the sample.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Note: The statement of inferential statistics will only hold true when the sample is sampled <strong>randomly</strong>.</em></p>



<p>A major part of inferential statistics is decision making. But to make a decision you must know the combinations of outcomes that might occur, and in what variation.</p>



<p>Let’s take an example to understand this better. Let’s say you’re given a coin and you have to estimate the fraction of heads you would get if you flipped the coin a certain number of times. How confident would you be to say that all flips will turn heads? Or that heads will come up the (t+1)th time? Let’s weigh in some possibilities to make it interesting:</p>



<ul><li>Flipped a coin 2 times. Both were heads, will you weigh in this if you were to predict the outcome of the 3rd toss?</li><li>What if there are 100 trials and all come up heads, will you feel more comfortable thinking 101st flip will be heads? (nowhere is it mentioned that it’s a fair coin, might as well be weighted)</li><li>Now, what if out of 100 trials, 52 came up heads? Will your best guess be 52/100?</li></ul>



<p>For t=2 times you’d be less confident to predict the third one head, and for t=100 you’d be more confident to predict 101st flip to be heads when all are heads than the case where 52 flips were heads.</p>



<p>The answer to this is <strong>variance</strong>. The confidence in our estimate depends on two things:</p>



<ul><li>Size of the sample (100 vs 2)</li><li>The variance of the sample (all heads vs 52 heads)</li></ul>



<p>As the variance grows, we need larger samples to have the same degree of confidence. When almost half are heads and half are tails, the variance is high, but when the outcome is always <em>heads,</em> the variance is almost 0.</p>



<p>Let’s now see some experiments based on Monte Carlo methods in action.</p>



<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation experiments</h2>



<p>One of the most popular games that’s common among statisticians and gamblers is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> <strong><em>Roulette</em></strong></a>! Of course, for various different reasons we’re gonna see the Monte Carlo simulation in action by running over the game of roulette.</p>



<p>To make this fun, we’re gonna divide this into 3 experiments influenced by each other:</p>



<ul><li>Fair Roulette: Expected value for the return of your bets should be 0%.</li><li>European Roulette: Expected value for the return of your bets should be ~-2.7%</li><li>American Roulette: Expected value for the return of your bets should be ~-5.5%.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Fair Roulette</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s define a simple python class to simulate the game:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> random
random.seed(<span>0</span>)
<span><span>class</span> <span>FairRoulette</span><span>()</span>:</span>
   <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self)</span>:</span>
       self.pockets = []
       <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>1</span>,<span>37</span>):
           self.pockets.append(i)
       self.ball = <span>None</span>
       self.pocketOdds = len(self.pockets) - <span>1</span>
   <span><span>def</span> <span>spin</span><span>(self)</span>:</span>
       self.ball = random.choice(self.pockets)
   <span><span>def</span> <span>betPocket</span><span>(self, pocket, amt)</span>:</span>
       <span>if</span> str(pocket) == str(self.ball):
           <span>return</span> amt*self.pocketOdds
       <span>else</span>: <span>return</span> -amt
   <span><span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(self)</span>:</span>
       <span>return</span> <span>'Fair Roulette'</span>
</pre>



<ul><li>There are 36 pockets numbered from 1–36</li><li>Initially, the ball is at None. The wheel is spun and the ball lands on one of these pockets randomly</li><li>If the pocket number on which the ball landed matches with the number you bet on priorly, you win the game. So if you bet $1 at the start and you win the hand then you end up with $36. Amazing, isn’t it?</li></ul>



<p>Now a function to put all instructions and rules together:</p>



<pre><span><span>def</span> <span>playRoulette</span><span>(game, numSpins, pocket, bet, toPrint)</span>:</span>
   totalPocket = <span>0</span>
   <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(numSpins):
       game.spin()
       totalPocket += game.betPocket(pocket, bet)
   <span>if</span> toPrint:
       print(f<span>'{numSpins} spins of {game}'</span>)
       print(f<span>'Expected return betting {pocket} = {str(100*totalPocket/numSpins)}% \n'</span>)
   <span>return</span> (totalPocket/numSpins)
</pre>



<p>The code is pretty much self-explanatory. <em>totalPocket</em> is a variable that keeps the sum of the money you won/lost. <em>numSpins</em> is how many times you placed a bet or spun the wheel.</p>



<p>Now let’s run this thing for 100 and 1 million spins.</p>



<pre>game = FairRoulette()
<span>for</span> numSpins <span>in</span> (<span>100</span>, <span>1000000</span>):
   <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>3</span>):
       playRoulette(game, numSpins, <span>2</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>True</span>)
</pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="394" height="402" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Fair-rulette-results.png?resize=394%2C402&amp;ssl=1" alt="Fair rulette results " srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Fair-rulette-results.png?w=394&amp;ssl=1 394w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Fair-rulette-results.png?resize=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1 294w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>You can see in the image above</p>



<ul><li>For 100 spins you’ve got a 44% positive return followed by a negative 28%, and again a positive 44%, much higher variance but things get interesting when you look at the bigger picture.</li><li>For a million spins the returns always hover around the mean 0 which is what we started with. The variance is low.</li></ul>



<p>One must be wondering why bother with a million spins? A gambler might not, but a casino surely will. For a gambler, it’s harder to predict how much he’ll win or lose that day, given that he can play 100 games on that particular day. But a casino has to run for years with millions of gamblers playing tens of millions of hands.</p>



<p>So what’s going on with the experiment is something called the <strong>law of large numbers</strong>. According to the law of large numbers:</p>



<p>the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.</p>



<p>That means if we spun the roulette wheel an infinite number of times, the expected return would be zero. A million is closer to the infinite than 100, so we got the result much closer to zero when spun a million times than a hundred.</p>



<p>This law is often miscued with any game of chance. Take an example of a fair coin. If 10 consecutive heads appear (highly unlikely, p=1/1024) then a person would think the next 10 flips would result in &gt;5 tails (more tails than heads) just to even things out. This is called <strong>Gambler’s Fallacy</strong>. A more constructive approach to look at this would be <strong>regression to the mean, </strong>which says “following an extreme event (highly unlikely), the next random event is likely to be less extreme”. In the coin case, it’s likely that in the next 10 flips you’ll get fewer than 10 heads followed by an extreme heads event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you look at the average of 20 flips, it will be closer to the expected mean of 50% heads than to the 100% of the first 10 flips.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our roulette experiment, and now run European and American roulette. You see, casinos are not in the business of being fair. After all, they have to stick up to the phrase “the house always wins!”. In …</p></article></div></div>

    <p>From the Linux kernel to Firefox and Wordpress, Open Source is changing the world for the better. But how to achieve financial sustainability when you produce something that can legally be copied, by design, at zero cost?</p>
<h2 id="revenue-models-for-open-source">Revenue models for Open Source</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23218943">lot</a> has been written about <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">achieving profitability</a> for open source projects, still it’s not a solved problem. Here are the most common ways for open source projects to generate profit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting: where you offer a fully-managed version of your project. It’s certainly the easiest way to scale revenues but it’s not appropriate for all products.</li>
<li>Paying support: popularized by Red Hat and other Linux distributions, this model is hard to scale and create bizarre incentives.</li>
<li>Patronage: patrons are helping artists make a living since forever. Unfortunately as you are depending on the goodwill of your patrons, it’s an extremely precarious way of life without a huge audience.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">VC</a>: According to my empirical study, it’s extremely hard to create a long term business whose interests are aligned with those of its users going this way.</li>
<li>Having a real job™ beside: but is your project worth sacrificing all your free time for it?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bloom">Bloom</h2>
<p>Early in 2019, I innocently started working on <a href="https://github.com/skerkour/bloom">Bloom</a> with one mission: putting an end to digital feudalism (Why? How? What? 👉 <a href="https://kerkour.com/blog/bloom-a-free-and-open-source-google">You can read the launch post here</a>).
The idea resonated with a lot of people and I received more positive feedback than I would ever have imagined.</p>
<p>But the path to success was still not clear: I launched the project as a self-hostable web application with a plan to create native applications with end-to-end encryption later. It quickly turned into a full-time R&amp;D project as end-to-end encryption is not yet a totally solved problem (especially its key distribution part) and neither is native applications distribution (App stores being controlled by two companies that are more and more user hostile).</p>
<p><img src="https://kerkour.com/blog/valley_of_death.jpg"></p>
<p>So, how to survive the valley of death and stay alive enough time to reach product-market fit and turn Bloom into a sustainable open source project?</p>
<h2 id="black-hat-rust">Black Hat Rust</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skerkour">
    <img src="https://kerkour.com/blog/github_contributions.png">
</a></p><p>While developing Bloom, I have written and deleted a hundred thousand lines of code of Rust, if not more. From achieving great development speed to designing and implementing an en-to-end encrypted synchronization protocol, passing by handling millions of HTTP requests a day, I’ve learned a few things along the way. <br>
Why not turn these thousand hours of experience into a profit which will allow me to arrange free hours during the week to work on Bloom? <br>
Some friends suggested that I launch an Udemy course, but I was not a fan of the idea because I find the ratio of information / time of these video courses too low compared to a good old book.</p>
<p>So I decided to write a book about Rust. As I had experience with offensive security (developing an automated vulnerability scanner, reverse engineering applications and helping plenty of companies to secure their assets) I narrowed the scope of the book to offensive security programming with Rust. <br>
Rust is not only a great fit for offensive programming, but the only one-size-fits-all programming language able to meet all the needs of this field: from shellcodes and exploits to servers, RATs and phishing pages in WebAssembly, Rust is polyvalent enough to shine in all those tasks. <br>
<em>Black Hat Rust - Deep dive into offensive security with the Rust programming language</em> was born!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lcow5j/black_hat_rust_im_writing_a_book_about_offensive">I announced the (extremely) early-access edition of the book on Reddit</a> last week and received a lot of positive feedback. <br>
Idea validated. Funding secured. 🥳 <br>
Even if the hardest part is yet to come, I just want to say a big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all the people who are making this possible. <br>
Since this Monday I have started to work 4 days a week on the book and 2 days on Bloom (yes, as an indie hacker my workweek is 6 days long 🤷‍♂️).</p>
<p>If you find the idea compelling and want to be part of the adventure, here is a coupon to save 10€ on the book: <a href="https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG">https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG</a>.</p>

        <p>A company that will remain nameless (unless someone convinces me otherwise) recently sent me this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks so much for agreeing to your virtual on-site interview for a position in the &lt;redacted&gt;!</p>

  <p>Beforehand, please take a look at the comments below:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Your presentation is expected to be in front of a fairly diverse audience.  Members of the interview panel are going to be there, and members from other functions, such as marketing, may attend as well.  Prepare with this in mind.</li>
    <li>For your presentation, you may want to begin with a brief introduction of who you are and where you have been in your career.  Consider giving the audience a sense of who you are and what has motivated you in your career development.</li>
    <li>From previous experiences, there will likely be questions and interruptions during your presentation.  Some questions may be general, and some may be specific and technical.  Manage your time wisely.</li>
    <li>Choose 1-2 projects that you have worked on in-depth and personally; you would know these projects well and be excited to talk about them.  Convey your excitement to the audience.  Talk about recent (rather than old) projects if possible.</li>
    <li>Be prepared to go into details on the projects you will present.  Do give a high-level overview of the project (e.g., What is the problem?  Why is it important?) . Do go into some level of technical specifics.  What have you done?  How have you done it?</li>
    <li>Give the audience a sense of <em>how</em> you think.  What were the factors you considered when you approached the problem?  What were the challenges?  How did you overcome them?  Provide specific examples whenever possible.</li>
    <li>You may present your slide deck directly from your laptop or send me a copy and I will flip thru the deck for you during the presentation.  It is your choice.</li>
    <li>Please install Zoom and Microsoft Teams on your laptop prior to the seminar.  We will use Microsoft Teams as default and Zoom as backup.
We greatly look forward to meeting you!</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>They wanted me to make a hour long presentation as part of the interview.
The last time I made a talk that long, I practiced it for weeks.
Given that they gave me a week’s heads-up total, I took the weekend and put together what I could.
I’d say I put in a dozen hours, realistically.
I was pretty excited about the final product and was kinda looking forward to giving the talk.
The day before my interview, I got this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good Morning Jessime,</p>

  <p>I must inform you, that your Zoom Interview for tomorrow, Wednesday, February 10th got canceled.  Our recruiter will give you a call for more information.
Have a great day and stay safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recruiter called me and we talked briefly.
They said that I interviewed extremely well, but that they decided to go with another candidate.
That’s fair, I suppose.
They were looking for someone with a few years of experience working with a specific technology I had never used.
But… they knew that from my resume.</p>

<p>And from my first interview.</p>

<p>And from my second interview.</p>

<p>And when they told me that I needed to prep a talk.</p>

<p>The recruiter told me, “Don’t be shy about reapplying for another position.”
Thank you, but I’m probably good.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to share my presentation somewhere, so I guess I’ll share it here.</p>

<p><em>Because we’ve run the numbers, and shit’s not great</em>.</p>







<p>Four years ago, Crystal and I retired from venture capital to carve out more time for things that matter, with Earth’s climate disaster at the top of the list. Why? The situation is much worse than it seems. The planet is warming faster than experts predicted. Rising temperatures fuel lethal heat waves, year-round fires, destructive storms, and epic droughts that are already killing thousands of people around the globe, displacing millions more, and sowing the seeds of famine, disease, and war. Heavy stuff.</p>



<p>Academic debates about exactly how many degrees the planet will warm, which species will go extinct, how many millions of people will be killed by extreme weather, which wars and refugee crises will result from drought, and whether sea levels will rise 10, 20, or 30 feet all miss the point. The bottom line is the planet is becoming unlivable. If you’re the quantitative type, well, we drew some samples, crunched a few numbers and, according to our exact scientific calculations: A lot of shit will be pretty fucked up.</p>



<p>In simplest terms, more carbon equals more heat, and more heat equals more death. This is an established and unavoidable fact. Today, the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are higher than at any point in at least 800,000 years (and arguably as far back as 23 million). Pumping all this CO<sub>2</sub> into the sky is like locking ourselves in a car on a sunny day.</p>







<h2><span>What will it take to get us out of this nightmare? </span></h2>



<p>Electric cars and solar panels are awesome but only a part of the picture. To bring down CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere it will take:</p>



<blockquote><p><span><span>01</span></span>   Slashing new emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases to zero.</p><p><span><span>02</span></span>   Sucking up at least a trillion tons of carbon already swirling around the sky.</p><p><span><span>03</span></span>   Buying all of humanity, including those most vulnerable, more time by actively cooling the planet.</p></blockquote>



<p>I am not new to this challenge. Way back when I was at Google, I was tasked with leading many of the company’s clean energy deals, repping execs in meetings with policy groups and think tanks, and exploring innovative ways to use technology to reduce the carbon footprint of a company that was, at the time, rumored to the be the largest individual power consumer in two or three US states. (If saying that violates my Google NDA, then no, we definitely weren’t a massive user of electrical power. Nothing to see here.)</p>



<p>In the years that followed, Crystal and I have been active supporters of legislative and regulatory efforts to address the problems, as well as funders of philanthropy and activism in the climate space. We’ve been poking around academic labs, comparing notes with environmental non-profits, briefing political leaders, cajoling philanthropists, sponsoring research and primers, and advising companies concerned about the climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After almost 20 years of this work, here is what we know to be true:</p>



<p><strong>Policy change alone ain’t gonna get us there.</strong> High fives to everyone who is working on clean tech regulatory initiatives. This vital work brings down real costs, creates research breakthroughs, and keeps urgent climate issues front and center. But even the most aggressive ideas on the table today fall short of the drastic action needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Guilt and shame don’t and won’t change anything at scale. </strong>There simply aren’t enough people willing to buy more expensive products nor companies on board with overpaying for sustainable materials just because they feel bad. Cheers to consumers and companies that spend a little more to choose options with climate in mind. You’ve undoubtedly helped create a new generation of climate friendly companies. However, we need about seven billion more of you to get on board before the impact will be meaningful enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Philanthropy is way too small and cautious</strong>. For the better part of twenty years, climate philanthropy has been overwhelmingly focused on consumer awareness campaigns to persuade people that climate change is real and to turn out their lights. But there’s been too little appetite to invest in hardcore, massive change. Bless you and those paper straws, but unless we zero out the billions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from huge sectors like aviation, steelmaking, industrial chemicals, building, and farming, we are screwed.</p>



<p>So, policy, philanthropy, and individual behavior do have roles to play, but the real solutions to the carbon nightmare will win because they’re cheaper, better, faster, stronger, simpler, and just plain cooler than what’s available today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Markets already understand that it’s too damn expensive to keep powering our economy by digging up and burning old dinosaur bones. In most places today, solar and wind are cheaper and scale faster. What you might not know yet is that technologies that grow chemicals in bioreactors or boost crop yields are already outperforming 100-year-old industrial processes that are dirty and dangerous. We see this happening in protein, transportation, chemicals, building materials, and even mining too. This radical shift isn’t just because of some warm and fuzzies. These are real businesses, with insane growth, and some posting nine-figure revenue run rates.</p>



<p>We’re on a clear trajectory to 8.5 billion people on this planet. I’m going out on a limb and predict they’ll want to eat, build houses, go places, buy stuff, and enjoy life. Fair to say? The most profitable companies meeting this demand will be those that sell products and services that use less carbon because they are ultimately the cheapest to offer. In simple terms, cutting gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>, mass market adoption, and generating piles of money will go hand-in-hand.</p>







<h2><span>Who knew we would look forward to email?</span></h2>



<p>When the word got out that we were starting to dig into climate tech, our inboxes blew up. Notes came in from very small and unreasonably ambitious teams taking on intimidatingly large projects to slash CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and suck carbon right out of the air. Frankly, we’ve never felt so energized reading our email. It was everything we loved about startups colliding with all of the urgency we felt for helping a planet on fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also a dynamic that makes climate tech today different from clean tech 15 years ago. It reminds me of the dramatic shift in startup economics that made YCombinator and its companies possible. Back then, the rise of open-source coding tools, cloud hosting, and the elimination of legal and financing friction empowered a new type of company and a new type of company-builder. The old way required millions of dollars and a rash of bankers and lawyers to even consider writing the first line of code. Suddenly startups had tiny, ragtag teams, usually without any fancy MBAs on board, raising tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for services and apps that they built and launched within weeks.</p>



<p>In climate tech, we have seen the same evolution. I appreciate the investors who have been plowing money into this stuff for decades and I admire their passion and commitment to doing the right thing. But, too often low-carbon businesses were among the most expensive to start. CapEx was bonkers right out of the gate, and most companies relied upon government intervention to even approach viability.</p>



<p>Are we excited to see the Biden/Harris administration finally at the wheel? Hell yes. They believe in science and have made climate a priority across the entire federal government. We have the deepest respect for Secretary Kerry and Gina McCarthy, and we admire the depth of expertise and hustle we are seeing across the staffers accepting roles to serve the USA to advance climate work. As members of Climate Leaders for Biden, and as a consequence of our involvement across the industry, we have already been in close touch with the administration and we are beyond heartened to see how serious they are about climate. Multiple times, Crystal and I have spoken directly with President Biden about climate and I can assure you he gets the gravity and urgency of the moment. Yet, despite all that, we aren’t counting on the government’s direct help in our investment thesis. Why?</p>



<p>Today, with shared lab space, massive computing clusters available for rent, proliferation of machine learning, cheap renewable electricity, the discovery of CRISPR/Cas9, breakthroughs in electrochemistry, and more streamlined tech transfer from universities, true seed-stage climate tech startups are possible at scale. Some benefit from grants and government investment, and no doubt healthy public investment in research and science lifts all boats, but barely any of these climate tech companies count on governments for handouts because they increasingly can rely upon free markets to reward them with customers. Add to this what might be the first generation of hard science engineers who, inspired by a prior, similar shift in computer science academia, now go to school knowing from day one they want to graduate to directly become company founders. These teams are taking their innovations straight to consumers and enterprises who may not vote for the same people nor share the same climate values, but who buy their products and services because they are just simply cheaper and better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h2><span>We call this thing Lowercarbon Capital.</span></h2>



<p>It wasn’t in the master plan to get back into the investing world full-time. But after a few years of doing this work, we picked up our heads and realized we now have a portfolio of over 30 climate teams and growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our startups straddle a delicate line between, “Whaaa? That’s absolutely bananas!” to, “No way. Are you f’ing kidding me?!” You know, chill stuff like confining plasma that’s hotter than the sun or growing full-on real meat steaks in a vat. Maybe using microbes to make hundreds of millions of dollars of industrial chemicals is your thing, or you’re into kelp-growing robots in the high seas. I’m kinda partial to …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developing and testing software on Kubernetes usually means building and moving container images from the developer workstation to a container registry, and ultimately, Kubernetes. When considering all the moving parts, the complexity and context switches break the development flow. Gone are the days where developers just hit a command and a few seconds later the newly built software is ready for testing.</p><p>What if there was some magical tool that you could simply feed instructions like: “Build this Dockerfile <em>here</em> and replace any existing image on <em>that</em> Kubernetes cluster with the results!” ASAP. Spoiler Alert! That is exactly what BuildKit CLI for kubectl is there to do.</p><p>Building container images with Docker is the typical method for most users, but it is not the only option to build container images. In situations in which the workload is already running in a container, like Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipeline or a serverless function, it is not always possible to run Docker.</p><p>Where the required Docker features may not have been available historically, alternative approaches emerged that only replicated the required functionality. In this post, we not only introduce a unique method for building container images with BuildKit CLI for kubectl, but we will also discuss two solutions that are sure to save developers hours of time and a much cleaner CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>Before we dive into the details, let’s break down Docker into its different functionalities. Docker as an application serves multiple purposes and in essence is a monolithic application holding multiple functionalities. This overview shows Docker’s functionalities and their single-purpose alternatives, allowing us to determine where BuildKit CLI for kubectl fits.</p><ul><li>Container engine: <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a></li><li>Container runtime: <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a>, <a href="https://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a></li><li>Image Build: <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">BuildKit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko">Kaniko</a>, <a href="https://buildah.io/">Buildah</a></li><li>Inspection: <a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive">dive</a>, <a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">Skopeo</a></li></ul><p>Depending on the case, multiple single-purpose tools carved out of Docker exist that help replicate some needed Docker functionality. Even better, these tools usually work well together as <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>-conformant runtimes.</p><h2 id="buildkit-cli-for-kubectl">BuildKit CLI for kubectl</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl">BuildKit CLI for kubectl</a> is a plugin for kubectl the Kubernetes command-line tool. The plugin extends the functionality of kubectl, allowing to build container images without a local Docker installation.</p><p>VMware <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2020/11/17/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/">open sourced</a> BuildKit CLI for kubectl in 2020. The initial product announcement sums up pretty well the purpose of the tool:</p><blockquote><p>A key feature of this new tool is that it strives to make the images you build immediately available in the container runtime of your Kubernetes cluster so you can “bounce” your pod(s) to pick up a freshly built image with virtually no overhead.</p></blockquote><p>BuildKit CLI for kubectl has the following key features:</p><ul><li>Dockerfiles are parsed the same way as with the existing <code>docker build</code></li><li>Container images are built within Kubernetes, to leverage the power of your Kubernetes cluster</li><li>Builds OCI compatible images</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/blob/main/docs/multiarch.md">Supports building multi-architecture images</a></li><li>No local registry needed for local Kubernetes development</li></ul><h2 id="inner-loop-productivity-flow">Inner-Loop Productivity Flow</h2><p>As developers, we spend a significant amount of time in the so-called “Inner Loop.” This is an iterative process where code is written, built, and tested repeatedly. All this takes place before we share our work with the team and the rest of the world, hence the need for code reviews and a CI workflow prior to pushing our completed work. The tight loop is the productive phase of the development process, therefore we want to spend as much time in the iterations as possible.</p><p>Iterations should be fast and with minimal friction. For example, if it takes 30 minutes to complete one loop, we can average around 10-12 loops a day. By shrinking that time to three minutes, we can theoretically make over 100 iterations of writing and testing code in a single day. That’s a huge productivity boost without “context switches” while waiting for your code to compile and deploy.</p><p>Mitch Denny has written an accurate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107102000/https://mitchdenny.com/the-inner-loop/">summary about the inner-loop</a> and how to tune it.<br></p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/productivity-lift-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/Inner-loop-outer-loop.svg" alt="Inner Loop and outer Loop Development Workflow" width="100%"></figure><p>There are two ways to speed up the inner-loop. More hardware power to reduce the time it takes to build and deploy, or take some shortcuts by skiping steps in the cycle. BuildKit CLI for kubectl falls into the latter category. It allows us to skip superfluous steps, allowing us to reduce context switches to decrease wait time resulting in more iterations. The diagram above illustrates the two methods of deploying an application to Kubernetes. The common practice today is:</p><ul><li>Compile the code and package the artifacts</li><li>Build the container image locally</li><li>Push the container image to a container registry</li><li>Execute the deployment</li><li>Let Kubernetes pull the container image from the container registry</li><li>Start the application</li></ul><p>With BuildKit CLI for kubectl, the need to repeat all the steps every time we want to test our changes is no longer there. After the initial full cycle we only need our Kubernetes cluster to build the new image and restart the pods requiring updates. By mastering the lean image build workflow, it all should take less than a few seconds.</p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/productivity-lift-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/workflow-with-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl.svg" alt="Common practice workflow with and without BuildKit CLI for kubectl" width="100%"></figure><p>Enough theory! Let us examine this workflow in practice and replace our local <code>docker build</code> with <code>kubectl build</code> for our Kubernetes development workflow.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>Download the binaries for your platform from github on <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/releases">vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/releases</a>.</p><p>The best way to work with kubectl plugins is to use <a href="https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/">Krew</a> the plugin manager for kubectl. Unfortunately, at the moment of writing, buildkit-cli-for-kubectl is <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/issues/5">not supported yet</a>. Once the buildkit-cli-for-kubectl Krew plugin is available, the installation will be simple:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">kubectl krew install buildkit-cli-for-kubectl
</code></pre></div><p>After downloading the binary for and extracting it:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cat darwin-*.tgz | tar -C /usr/local/bin -xvf -
<span>#This is an example for MacOS &amp; Linux</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can verify the successful installation and the plugin registration with <code>kubectl</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">kubectl build --help
or
kubectl buildkit --help
</code></pre></div><p>The buildkit-cli-for-kubectl package contains two binaries: <code>buildkit</code> and <code>build</code> which is simply an alias for <code>buildkit build</code>.
Now that we have installed buildkit-cli-for-kubectl and verified its functionality, we can try to make something useful.</p><h2 id="example-application">Example Application</h2><p>For our example, we are going to use a simple Hello-World Go application. There is no need to install anything locally as the Golang toolset, and everything needed is within the Dockerfile.</p><p>Clone the minimum Hello-World application from <a href="https://github.com/container-registry/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl-demo-app">buildkit-cli-for-kubectl-demo-app</a></p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">git clone https://github.com/container-registry/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl-demo-app.git
cd buildkit-cli-for-kubectl-demo-app
</code></pre></div><h3 id="building-an-image-with-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl">Building an Image with BuildKit CLI for kubectl</h3><p>To build container images, we need to have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. One easy option to set up a local Kubernetes cluster it to use <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/">minikube</a> or <a href="https://k3d.io/">k3d</a>. Note that k3d needs <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/blob/main/docs/installing.md#k3d">a workaround</a>.</p><p>To build a Container Image with BuildKit CLI for kubectl simply run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">kubectl build -t hello-world -f Dockerfile .
</code></pre></div><p>The CLI build syntax is the same as Docker build.
In this example, the first built took around ~70 seconds, which is not very impressive to be considered a quick iteration.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ kubectl build -t 8gears.container-registry.com/examples/hello-world -f Dockerfile .

If you had some kind of shared state, configuration or other information you would like to use anywhere in you application, you had to pass it down from parent to child to sibling to another child. There <em>was</em> a way to avoid it, but that way - the “legacy context API” was never officially supported, and was documented with a warning that it should not be used.</p><p>About the same time React was released to the public, some other Facebook engineers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&amp;v=nYkdrAPrdcw&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">introduced a blueprint</a> for how they created front end applications - the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flux architecture</a>.

For each new way of changing the state, you had to add a new action type and action creator, probably a dispatcher and a selector, and then you’d have to handle that new state change in an existing reducer, or create a new one. In other words - lots and lots of boilerplate.</p><p>When the 16.3 version of React was released, it finally shipped with a fully redesigned context API. With this new feature, prop drilling was suddenly as easy as wrapping any subsection of your application in a context provider, and fetching it again with a context consumer component.

Hooks made using state and side effects much easier, and made away with the need for class components altogether. In addition, the context API was suddenly much easier to consume, which made it much more user friendly.

The elegance of reducers were suddenly built into React itself, and prop-drilling was a solved challenge. New projects were started without having Redux in the stack - a previous no-brainer - and more and more projects started to consider moving away from Redux altogether.</p><p>As a response, the team currently maintaining Redux (led by a gentleman named Mark Eriksson) started two different efforts. They introduced an opinionated toolkit named <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux Toolkit</a> that did away with most boilerplate code through conventions, and they added a <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hooks-based API</a> for reading state and dispatching actions.</p><p>Together these two new updates simplified Redux codebases substantially. But is it really enough to defend introducing the added complexity of the concepts in Redux to a new project? Is the value Redux adds more than the added cost of teaching new employees about Yet Another Tool?</p><p>Let’s look at where React does a great job by itself, and in what cases the tradeoff of complexity vs power is worth it.</p><h2 id="when-react-is-enough">When React is enough</h2><p>Most React applications I’ve worked with have been pretty small in scope. They’ve had a few global pieces of state that was used across the application, and some data that was shared across a few different views.</p><p>Besides from this though, many React applications don’t have a lot of shared state. Most state  like the content of input fields or whether a modal is open, is only interesting to the component that contains them! No need to make that state globally available. </p><p>Other pieces of state might be shared, but only by a part of the application. Perhaps a particular page requires a piece of state to be shared across several of its components, or a sidebar needs to expose some remote status to all of its children. Either way, that’s not global state - it’s state scoped to a part of the application.</p><p>By keeping state co-located, or as close to its dependents as possible, you ensure that it’s deleted whenever the feature requiring it is deleted, and that it’s discoverable without leafing through tens of different reducers.</p><p>If you need to share app-wide settings that rarely change, React’s context API is a great tool to reach for. One example of this is what locale is currently active:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleContext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createContext</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  locale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"en-US"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>setLocale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleProvider</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span> value</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span> locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale </span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>props</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useLocale</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Other use cases can be what color theme is active, or even what experiments are active for a given user.</p><p>Another very useful approach is using a small data-fetching library like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SWR</a> or <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React-Query</a> to handle fetching and caching your API responses for you. To me, cached data isn’t really global state - it’s just cached data. This is much simpler to handle with these small single-use libraries, than introducing async thunks or sagas to your Redux rig. Also, you don’t have to handle all the complex variations of isLoading, hasError and what not. With these libraries, it works out of the box.</p><p>A thing these context use cases have in common is the fact that they represent data that rarely updates. Rarely in the context of computer science is a bit vague, but in my mind, less than a couple of times every second is pretty rare. And as it turns out, that’s the way the React Context API works best!</p><p>The use cases summarized above covers most of the situations I’ve met in real world applications. Actual global state is rare and far between, and is often better off being co-located with the code that actually uses it, or provided through the context API.</p><h2 id="situations-where-redux-might-be-warranted">Situations where Redux might be warranted</h2><p>With all that said, Redux is still a great product. It’s well documented, adopted by many, and can be combined with the approaches posted above. But what use cases warrants the added complexity and learning curve of adding Redux to your stack in 2021?</p><p>One of the use cases I see most in the projects I’m involved with is when you have advanced data fetching scenarios that requires a lot of cascading network communication. One might argue that this is best done on the server side, but there are definitely use cases where handing this on the client is warranted. Redux, particularly in combination with so-called thunks, is extremely versatile and flexible when it comes to such orchestration.</p><p>Another use case is for very interdependent states, or states that are derived from several other states. This is possible to handle in React as well, but the end result is still much easier to both share, reuse and reason about in Redux.</p><p>A third use case is for those where the state of your application can change very rapidly. The lead architect of React, Seb Markbåge, stated a few years ago that the current …</p></div></article></div>

Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> and Azure Databricks are widely adopted technologies in the industry, but they require specific skills and expertise to run. Leveraging Confluent Cloud and Azure Databricks as fully managed services in Microsoft Azure, you can implement new real-time data pipelines with less effort and without the need to upgrade your datacenter (or set up a new one).</p>
<p>This blog post demonstrates how to configure Azure Databricks to interact with Confluent Cloud so that you can ingest, process, store, make real-time predictions and gain business insights from your data.</p>
<p>Below is a common architectural pattern used for streaming data:</p>

<p>Now that your topic is receiving data, you can move to Azure Databricks to see how to leverage it!</p>
<h2 id="process"><a id="process"></a>Process the Data with Azure Databricks</h2>
<h3 id="step-4"><a id="step-4"></a>Step 4: Prepare the Azure Databricks environment</h3>
<h4 id="databricks"><a id="databricks"></a>Spin up an Azure Databricks instance</h4>
<p>If you do not already have an Azure Databricks environment, you will need to spin one up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to the Azure Portal and search for “Azure Databricks”</li>
<li>When the page comes up, click the <strong>+Add</strong> button</li>
<li>Choose the subscription that you want the instance to be in (if it isn’t already filled in)</li>
<li>Choose the Resource Group that you want the instance to be in, or click <strong>Create new</strong> and give it a name</li>
<li>Enter a name for the Azure Databricks workspace</li>
<li>Select the region that you want the workspace to be created in</li>
<li>Select your pricing tier—you can select <strong>Trial</strong> to get 14 days of free Azure Databricks units</li>
<li>On the networking page, you can choose whether or not to deploy in your own VNet (deploying in your own VNet is recommended for instances that you intend to use long term; however, if you are spinning it up just to follow this blog example. Keep the default “No” selected and Azure Databricks will spin up a VNet)</li>
<li>Enter in any required tags</li>
<li>Click <strong>Review + create</strong>; if everything comes back as valid, then click the <strong>Create</strong> button to spin up the workspace</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Azure Databricks instance finishes deploying, you can navigate to it in the Azure Portal and click <strong>Launch Workspace</strong>. Alternatively, if you already have the URL for an Azure Databricks workspace, you can go to the URL directly in your browser.</p>
<h4 id="databricks-cluster"><a id="databricks-cluster"></a>Spin up and configure an Azure Databricks cluster</h4>
<p>Once you’re logged in to the Azure Databricks workspace, you will need a running cluster. If you do not already have a cluster that you would like to use for this example, you can spin one up by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Clusters</strong> icon in the left sidebar</li>
<li>Click <strong>+Create Cluster</strong></li>
<li>Give the cluster a name</li>
<li>Keep all the rest of the defaults and click Create Cluster</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the cluster is spun up, you will need to add an additional library to it. This example is for Python, but if you need this functionality in Scala, there is also an example Scala notebook that details which libraries are needed, you can find both in the <a href="#downloadable-notebooks">downloadable notebooks</a> section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the name of the cluster that you want to use</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Libraries</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example-notebook"><a id="example-notebook"></a>Example notebook</h4>
<p>The example for this tutorial uses Python, but there is also a Scala notebook available that enables the same functionality. The example below uses the sample clickstream data provided from Confluent Cloud’s Datagen Source Connector.</p>
<p>Below are the steps needed to successfully read, parse, and store Avro data from Confluent Cloud.</p>
<h3 id="step-5"><a id="step-5"></a>Step 5: Gather keys, secrets, and paths</h3>
<p>Using the following information, connect to the topic that you created in Confluent Cloud from Azure Databricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the Kafka cluster</li>
<li>The Kafka API key for the cluster that you generated earlier</li>
<li>The Kafka API secret for the cluster that you generated earlier</li>
<li>The bootstrap server for the cluster, which you can find in your Confluent Cloud instance starting from the home screen by clicking on the cluster and then clicking on <strong>Cluster settings</strong> in the left sidebar</li>
<li>The name of the Kafka topic</li>
</ul>
<p>To connect to the Schema Registry, which you will need in order to pull the schemas for parsing your Avro data, you need the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Schema Registry URL, which you can find in your Confluent Cloud instance by starting from the home screen and clicking on Settings and then Schema Registry API Access</li>
<li>The Schema Registry API key that you generated earlier</li>
<li>The Schema Registry API secret that you generated earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, to write the result to a Delta table, you need to specify the ADLS Gen2 path, a Data Bricks File System (DBFS) mount pointing to the ADLS Gen2 path, or a local DBFS location (such as <code>dbfs:/delta/mytable</code> and <code>dbfs:/delta/checkpoints/mytable</code>, which are not recommended for production jobs; however, they don’t require any additional authentication) where your Delta table and streaming checkpoint will be located.</p>

<p><time>February 7, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: Most companies use the wrong metrics during software engineering
interviews. That makes them both brutal for the candidates and inefficient for
the companies. Both sides suffer as a result. In this blog post, we propose how
to improve your hiring loop by using the right metric.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-of-using-the-wrong-metric">The problem of using the wrong metric</h2>

<p>Before we dive in, let’s recap how a typical hiring loop looks and the
rationale behind it. It usually consists of several technical interviews,
followed by “meet the CEO” ones. The technical interviews can take different
forms: from universally loathed on-site whiteboarding to pairing sessions using
online coding solutions. The unifying theme in all those forms is that the
candidate must solve all the puzzles the interviewers could come up with for
the interview and do that under pressure. Ultimately the decision of whether to
extend the offer depends on the candidate not making any technical mistakes.</p>

<p>In other words: can the candidate survive the interview.</p>

<p>The metrics one would get from such interviews are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ability to recall the implementation details of some algorithms or data
structures. A rarely used trait outside of the interview because you can
always look those things up. Some companies are outright recommending “Cracking
The Coding Interview” as a pre-interview practice. Let’s face the facts: how
many times have you referred to that book while working? This ability is not a
good predictor of whether the candidate will generate value. Learning recipes
by heart doesn’t guarantee a good chef. Memorizing traffic laws doesn’t make
you a safe driver. Why do you think remembering programming puzzles will
produce a great software engineer?</p></li>

<li><p>The ability to imagine outcomes. Questions like: what if the app has 10x more
clients? What if memory pressure increases? What interviewers hope to measure
is building or system design skills. Instead, they measure imagination, which
is an entirely different trait. Of course, experienced candidates can share
more war stories of things going wrong. But, unless you test the candidate’s
design with an actual 10x load, all you get is speculation.</p></li>

<li><p>How much the candidate’s thinking process aligns with that of an interviewer.
They ask the same questions to many candidates and expect the usual answers.
If they encounter a unique solution, they have to counteract their confirmation
bias. As a brilliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer_question">Barometer</a> legend shows, this spawns further than software
engineers’ interviews. And thus, the candidate’s ability to deliver value
remains unmeasured.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Typical hiring loops can generate a sporadic great hire or two, but they are
not consistent in doing so. Like a coin toss, sometimes they yield the opposite
results, and making a bad hire is an expensive mistake. Burned by it, the
company will invest more resources trying to protect itself. The common-sense
approach is to pause and investigate why the hiring loop produced the mistake
in the first place. However, the hiring loop is usually the last to suspect –
after all, it brought the company to its current state, so it must be working,
right? That simple conclusion cloaks the hiring loop from improvement, and it
remains deficient. Instead of implementing the constructive changes, the
company raises the bar to entry. They start using trickier puzzles or asking
the candidates to design more complicated systems, sometimes while still
operating within the time frame of a typical one-hour on-site interview. That
undoubtedly makes interviews more brutal and harsh. Fewer candidates survive
them, and the company sees it as a positive change.</p>

<p>But that neither improves their filtering nor protects them from bad hires.
They get the same data points, again and again, never improving the signal to
noise ratio. If they raise the bar too high, they throw the baby out with the
bathwater as they start to pass on talent. All those metrics from the above
become a single one: can the candidate avoid making mistakes. Errare humanum
est, remember?</p>

<p>If the company does that for too long, then the hiring decisions become
protective and based on fear. Instead of highlighting the value that the
candidate brings to the table, the interviewers will seek a reason to reject
them. If they couldn’t find it, they will resort to biases and personal
inclinations. Training interviewers to reject the candidates will only produce
more efficient rejections.</p>

<blockquote>Tell me how you measure, and I will tell you how I will behave.
<p>Eli Goldratt, The Haystack Syndrome</p></blockquote>

<p>Improper metrics at the core of your hiring loop will make it yield inefficient
results. To fix that, we need to address the root cause and base the loop on a
better set of metrics.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-set-of-questions">A better set of questions</h2>

<p>We have refined three questions that determine a practical hiring decision for
a software engineer:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Can the candidate do the actual work?</li>
    <li>Can we work together?</li>
    <li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>This set is not a silver bullet that will drive your hiring loop from zero to
success. It is neither a secret knowledge nor a magic trick. Instead, it is the
common sense behind a hiring loop based on a proper metrics. Let’s explore them
in-depth so that you can build a similar hiring loop at your company.</p>

<h3 id="can-the-candidate-do-the-actual-work">Can the candidate do the actual work?</h3>

<p>Or, as we prefer to frame it: can the candidate deliver something that works in
production.</p>

<p>As simple as it looks, this is the main and the first thing you need to measure
about the candidate. Your company is there to build your product, not solve
riddles on a whiteboard. Your hiring loop should select for the ability to
contribute to the former, not the latter.</p>

<p>It is hard to measure the ability to perform without letting candidates do the
actual work. Companies that can’t measure it resort to proxy metrics and
instead try to predict the future. They check what they can, and they hope the
correlation will be on their side. Google used to ask ridiculous brain teasers
(and disgorged a horde of imitations). They stopped doing it because it turned
out to be <a href="https://qz.com/96206/google-admits-those-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/">completely useless</a> for hiring. Surprise? No, not at all. Just
another example that using improper metrics will yield unsatisfactory results.</p>

<p>The best way to check that someone can do real work is to allow them to do real
work. That is also the first thing you need to check before you engage in more
expensive interviews. The good news is that it is possible to do both.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-work-together">Can we work together?</h3>

<p>Or, in other words, the cultural fit question.</p>

<p>This metric is orthogonal to the previous, and you should measure it
separately. There will be candidates who can deliver exceptional code but who
can’t cooperate. And there will be candidates who fit your culture like a glove
yet can’t ship a single line of code to production. An efficient hiring loop
accurately handles both of those extremes and anything in between.</p>

<p>Companies usually try to measure this trait with “meet the CEO” style
interviews. That is not enough, as it is prone to unconscious biases of the
person performing the interview. To measure this metric correctly, you would
need to do some self-reflection first. You will need to understand what is the
culture that you are trying to build.</p>

<blockquote>Culture is the Behavior You Reward and Punish
</blockquote>

<p>The tough aspect of this measurement is that it is difficult to automate. It
will likely involve expensive human time, which is expensive to scale with the
demand. Therefore, we recommend performing this measurement at the end of your
hiring pipeline. This way, it will not become a costly bottleneck.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-candidate-want-to-work-with-me">Does the candidate want to work with me?</h3>

<p>The ultimate decision to join your company belongs to the candidate. They are
the ones who will accept the offer or reject it. Interviews work both ways, and
this phase of the loop is when the candidate measures your company. The
experience you provide to them during the interview will be with them for a
long time. They will share it with their friends and colleagues, tweet about
it, and discuss it online.</p>

<blockquote>They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you
made them feel.<p>Carl W. Buehner</p></blockquote>

<p>Invest in giving them the best experience possible. Your company will stand out
by being friendly, transparent, and approachable. If you want to be bold, allow
them to interview you, and do not judge their questions, but answer them
truthfully. Let them relax and be themselves, and you will help them picking
you for their next adventure.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Basing your hiring loop on the right metric could be what turns a stagnating
company into a thriving one. That will allow you to start bringing the best
talent aboard consistently. At this point, you no longer bet on a coin toss.</p>

<p>The next step is to automate the assessment and put it at the beginning of your
hiring loop. That will allow your interviewers to focus only on candidates that
can deliver. At this point, you no longer waste resources.</p>

<p>What’s left is to concentrate on building the best culture you aim to have and
stand out.</p>

</ul><p>The Indian government might soon allow companies to go ahead with a four-day work week. The Union Ministry of Labour and Employment is working on new labour codes which will make way for a three-day weekend, but will keep the </p><keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="working-hours" keynameseo="Working-hours" actualkeyword="Working hours">working hours</keyword><p> at 48 hours a week, which means employees might be subject to long days. 
</p><p>
“Companies will have to give three days’ of paid leaves and 12 hours of work per day to their employees with the consent of the workers. We are not forcing employees or employers. It gives flexibility. It’s an enabling provision in sync with the changing work culture. We have tried to make some changes. We have tried to give flexibility in working days,” said

Especially, given that employees, in many cases, are made to work beyond five days in a week currently.
</p><p>In India, employees work way beyond 48 hours a week – crossing the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) norms of working. According to the labour standards. “the general standard is 48 regular hours of work per week, with a maximum of eight hours per day.” says the ILO website.
</p><p>
    The changes will be a part of the new labour codes, whose draft rules are being formulated by the government. It will also provide free medical check-ups to workers through the Employees State Insurance Corporation, according to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-labour-codes-to-allow-4-day-work-week/article33784975.ece" rel="nofollow">reports.</a></p><p>
The four-day work week is not a new topic. It started off as a debate in Germany when the country’s largest trade union – IG Metall, called for a four-day week in 2020. And this, even when Germany already has the lowest working hours in a week at 34.2 hours.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr><p>Then came Microsoft's experiment in 2019 in its Japan office, where 
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/microsoft-experimented-with-a-4-day-work-week-in-its-japan-office-and-productivity-jumped-by-40/articleshow/71901595.cms">productivity jumped by 40%,</a> as a four-day week made for the perfect work-life balance. And it wasn’t just great for the employees; the number of pages printed was down, electricity consumption was a lot less as well. 
</p><p>
A World Economic Forum survey of businesses that had implemented the policy showed that it can help companies “make savings of almost £92 billion (around 2% of total turnover) each year”.
</p><p>
    But there are also challenges said the WEF survey, especially, in the service sector where four days might not be enough to meet consumer expectations and demands.

        <p><em>Hey! Today I have something different for you. Itâ€™s a piece about the weird world of LinkedIn â€” from celebrity </em>workfluencers<em> to the strange social features that feel out of place. This is a guest essay from <a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi">Fadeke Adegbuyi</a>, senior marketing manager at Doist and a fan of all things internet culture. I think youâ€™re going to like it! ðŸ˜†</em></p><p><em>- Nathan</em></p><p><em> </em>LinkedIn is the fucking worst.</p><p>Despite our collective confusion about the platform, its enthusiastic embrace by HR departments and recruiters has ensured its success. Even though it was <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/2020/july/a-message">forced to lay off 1,000 employees</a> because of the pandemic, they still increased their&nbsp;Q<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2020-Q4/press-release-webcast">4 revenue by 10%.</a> As of Q3 of 2020, the company has over 722 million users and is truly internationalâ€“â€“just 26% of their members are based in North America. With revenue largely powered by recruiting solutions, paid job listings, and advertising, LinkedIn knows how to appeal to businesses at scale. LinkedIn doesnâ€™t need <em>you</em> to like it.</p><p>But, the companyâ€™s consumer-side remains in the midst of a long-standing identity crisis. Feature bloat and odd idiosyncrasies make the site a superbly strange social network. Many of us have profiles but donâ€™t log in for months at a time. Our â€œAboutâ€� sections point to better ways to be reached. Others, seemingly alive and well, have claimed on their pages to have died.</p><p>LinkedIn bills itself as an online destination, like a conference held at a 5-star hotel where big thinkers give big speeches, deals get made in private corners, and you can â€œbuild and engage with your professional network.â€� But many of us see it as a not-so-funhouse, with wacky mirrors, jumpout surprises, and peculiar attractions. Can I interest you in a tour?</p><h2>Copy-Cat Cemetery&nbsp;</h2><p>LinkedIn recently released Stories, a vertical video feature copied from Instagram, who better stole it from Snapchat. LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Stories%20enable%20members%20and,of%20their%20everyday%20professional%20moments.&amp;text=LinkedIn%20shares%20Stories%20that%20you,recent%20version%20of%20the%20app.">suggests</a> users â€œshare images and short videos of their everyday professional moments.â€� Released in the midst of a global pandemic during a mass migration to remote work, itâ€™s unclear whether we should showcase cramped work setups on kitchen tables or restless kindergarteners interrupting the 143rd minute of a Zoom.&nbsp;</p><p>Available only on LinkedIn's iOS and Android apps, this begs the question...<em><strong>Who is using LinkedIn on their phone?</strong></em> The platform would like you to believe that celebrities are. A permanent Story from LinkedIn shows a reel of workfluencers â€“â€“Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, Deepak Chopra â€“â€“ posting professionally shot high-definition videos of their work days.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png"></a></p><p>A tagline ends the montage: â€œShare your story.â€� At last glance, only a single one of my 1000+ connections is using the feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Twitter is seeing early success with Fleets, their own copy-cat story feature that users have been receptive to, posting baby photos and dog pictures in between subtweets and shitposts. Feature imitation isnâ€™t a bad strategy. But LinkedIn Stories was dead on arrival. No one in the boardroom asked the critical question: <em>Who cares?</em></p><h2>The Audio Trolls</h2><p>Audio apps, like Clubhouse, Chalk, and Rodeo point to the power of sound-based social. Twitter released voice tweets earlier this spring and is currently working on an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">audio spaces feature</a>. LinkedIn has taken their own steps into voice with a handful of audio features. Like most things on the platform, they feel out of place.&nbsp;</p><p>The sentiment behind their name pronunciation feature on personal profiles is a positive one, but hasnâ€™t seen wide adoption for its intended purpose. Since the feature was launched, Iâ€™ve heard people with the most pronounceable of names use the feature for anything from inserting a 10-second clip from The Office to playing a song snippet at 2x speed. A now common but unintended use case is delightful trolling:</p><ul><li>At one point, Jeff Hui used the feature to ironically <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffistyping/status/1304947619651817477?s=21">shout an elevator pitch at recruiters</a></li><li>On Riva-Melissa Tezâ€™s profile, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riva-melissa-tez-661a0aab/">she declares herself â€œQueen Beeâ€�</a></li><li>Ben Taylor, who includes â€œclick 4 soundâ€� in his name, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata/">rickrolls his profile visitors</a></li></ul><p>On a site where people declare Ivy League associations, summa cum laude status, and internships at investment banks, cheeky irreverence for work culture warps the throughline of respectability that LinkedIn intends. Trolling LinkedIn, while on LinkedIn, is a break from the BusinessTM of polished headshots and corporately crafted â€œExperienceâ€� sections. Itâ€™s ironic participation on a platform where youâ€™re <em>meant</em> to be performing professionalism.&nbsp;</p><p>At times, it feels like LinkedIn is actively building features for the intended purpose of trolling. Within LinkedIn messages, users can hold down a microphone icon to record their voice. An audio snippet is an oddly intimate option for starting a professional conversation with a stranger. Perhaps thatâ€™s the point. But attempting to speed up relationships with overly familiar features is a â€œpersonal touchâ€� unwelcome in the world of networking, already so fraught with faux pas.</p><p>An innocent but outlandish 39-second audio message, sent by â€œ<a href="https://twitter.com/okcandice_/status/1285956830045380608?s=21">Jimmy from LinkedIn</a>â€� went viral as a case of networking-gone-not-quite-right:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>â€œHello Candice, how are you doing and good morning. How have you been? Hey Candice, this is me, Jimmy from LinkedIn. And the reason I was giving you this quick voice message call was to say thank you so kindly. I really appreciate that you have accepted me here on the LinkedIn platform. What we will do is learn from each-other. I appreciate your kindness. Jimmy from LinkedIn.â€�</blockquote><p>Though it doesnâ€™t feel malicious, itâ€™s just <em>off</em> to encounter this kind of weirdness in the same space you seek new job opportunities and professional updates from former colleagues and classmates. Itâ€™s the stuff that makes you pause and say, <em>Where am I?</em></p><h2>InMail Infinity</h2><p>The premise of the platform, bringing professionals together, is a challenging one from the start. People hate networking. Also, theyâ€™re bad at it.&nbsp;</p><p>For users, LinkedIn â€œnetworkingâ€� often means receiving a barrage of InMail and connection requests. You might recognize some or all of these:</p><ol><li><strong>The bad sales pitch</strong>: Sales people and business development people will slide into DMs to peddle their companyâ€™s products, whether youâ€™re the right person to buy or not. Usually not.</li><li><strong>The professional neg</strong>: Recruiters ask senior level employees if theyâ€™re interested in entry level roles or, better yet, internships.</li><li><strong>The just-in-case connection</strong>: Industry peers will suggest itâ€™s â€œmutually beneficialâ€� to connect, but donâ€™t specify these benefits up front.</li><li><strong>The endangered business school</strong>: Admissions teams are now online shilling once-coveted seats in their dwindling MBA programs. Based on your profile and experience, they think youâ€™re a â€œgreat fitâ€� and want you to apply.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The eager seeker</strong>: Some people see LinkedIn messages as an alternative resume and cover letter submission portal. This is why that endless string of people in your messages inquire about roles outside your departmentâ€¦ or outside your company.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The LinkedIn team</strong>: If their emails notifying you about connection requests wasnâ€™t enough, LinkedIn also maintains a direct line to your InMail. Expect prompts to try Premium, credits to advertise your company, and messages about whatever else theyâ€™re feeling.</li><li><strong>The proposition</strong>: Linkedin stands in the long-tradition of <em>every</em> site becoming a dating site. Or, er, a place to sexually harass people. If you havenâ€™t gotten one of these messages in your InMail, you know someone who has.</li></ol><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png"></a></p><p>Overfull InMail and random connection requests feels like a never-ending chore. You get enough work emails and donâ€™t need any more. LinkedInâ€™s constant drip of communication is just more work on top of the real work you have to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Linkedinâ€™s inbox infinity isnâ€™t just annoyingâ€”it detracts from the usability of the platform. Unless youâ€™re embracing a new position of processing and answering everything that comes through, if a real connection came along, how would you know?</p><h2>The Cursed Timeline</h2><p>At any given point on your LinkedIn timeline, youâ€™ll see a corporate blog post shared by someone you know, a marketing sales pitch from someone you donâ€™t, and a news story about COVID-19. Their timeline is similar in this way to other social networks, where you see posts made or liked by your connections, people and brands you follow, and promoted posts that people pay to get in front of you. This cacophony of content is bizarre, but not atypical â€“â€“ social feeds optimize for engagement, here as everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatâ€™s uniquely odd about LinkedIn is that it is not unique. â€œThe professional networkâ€� is still just a social network. Though the topics of the posts in your timeline may be on the world of work, diving into the comments, you can see polarization in action. Inspirational posts on giving parents grace while working from home during the pandemic have angry rants suggesting that kids are a personal choice and their burden shouldnâ€™t be foisted upon colleagues. Beneath articles on workplace harassment, sympathetic discussions ensue on why someone might naturally retaliate after being romantically rebuffed. A political article about the 2020 US presidential election draws comments on whether former President Barack Obama was really Black.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png"></a></p><p>In a time when the collective conversation is consumed by the topic of human cancellation, people readily post things on LinkedIn that make them fireable or unhireable.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png"></a></p><p>While these comments are nothing new in terms of online culture, they feel out of bounds on a professional website where people use their full names and disclose precisely where they work and the city they live in. In the alternate universe of LinkedIn, cancel culture either doesnâ€™t exist, its inhabitants are blissfully unaware, or they simply donâ€™t care.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png"></a></p><h2>The Rockstar Recruiters</h2><p>The strangest of Linkedinâ€™s features isnâ€™t a feature at all; itâ€™s a specific set of power users.&nbsp;</p><p>Every platform has its royalty.

<p>A few weeks ago Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter that he is donating <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/01/23/elon-musk-donating-carbon-capture-technology/">$100M for innovating the best carbon capture technology</a>. At the time, it was just an announcement, now further details and how to apply for the grant have emerged.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/musk-foundation/">The Musk Foundation</a> has selected XPRIZE.org to manage this fund which is the largest-ever prize for the cause donated by an individual. </p>



<p>XPRIZE will open registrations for the competition starting this year’s Earth Day (April 22nd, 2021) and the competition will run continuously for four years to find the best carbon capture solution. Currently, XPRIZE is only taking the email addresses of the interested persons or companies on the <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organization’s website</a> that will keep you updated with the happenings and notify you as soon as the application date arrives.</p>

<p>XPRIZE and Elon Musk will most likely be considering teams that are able to showcase the ability to reduce the carbon footprint on Gigaton levels. A technology capable of making a ‘truly measurable impact’ is what Musk and XPRIZE tea is looking for. </p>



<p>Gigaton (or gigatonne) is a unit of measuring mass that equals a billion metric tons. In other words, if an aircraft is able to carry 1 ton, it will take 10,000 aircraft carriers to lift a gigaton. The website of NASA <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2933/visualizing-the-quantities-of-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visually explains</a> ‘how big is a gigaton’, roughly equal to a sheet of ice placed on top of Central Park in Manhattan stacked 1,119 feet high.</p>



<p>The solutions presented by the participating teams will also have to be scalable and cost-effective in order to win the grant, says XPRIZE.</p>



<h2>How To Win</h2>



<p>XPRIZE web page for Elon Musk’s $100M donation details the following key points that can help a team win the prize.</p>



<blockquote><p>To win the competition, teams must demonstrate a rigorous, validated scale model of their carbon removal solution, and further must demonstrate to a team of judges the ability of their solution to economically scale to gigaton levels. The objective of this XPRIZE is to inspire and help scale efficient solutions to collectively achieve the 10 gigatons per year carbon removal target by 2050, to help fight climate change and restore the Earth’s carbon balance. </p><p>Teams can submit entries across natural, engineer and hybrid solutions.&nbsp; Judges in the competition will evaluate the teams based upon four basic criteria:</p><p>– A working carbon removal prototype that can be rigorously validated and capable of removing at least 1 ton per day.</p><p>– The team’s ability to demonstrate to the judges that their solution can economically scale to the gigaton level.</p><p>– The main metric for this competition is fully considered cost per ton, inclusive of whatever considerations are necessary for environmental benefit, permanence, any value-added products; and</p><p>– The final criteria is the length of time that the removed carbon is locked up for. A minimum goal of 100 years is desired.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XPRIZE</a></cite></blockquote>

        How does one reliably display digital artwork originally created by Andy Warhol on the Amiga 1000 in the 80s? This was the challenge laid out for Iontank by The Andy Warhol Museum after Cory Arcangel and a team from Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer Club successfully recovered digital Warhol images from floppy disks that had gone overlooked in the museum’s archives. <p> Iontank proposed creating Amiga replicas out of decommissioned Amiga 1000s. All internal components were replaced with new solid-state hardware so the units would be more stable as they toured the globe, but Iontank also took great care to restore and integrate the original mice and keyboards so they would work with the new systems. Even the lights on the monitor and case illuminate as intended. </p><p> Replacements for the antique CRT screens were also prototyped. Promising projection tests were ultimately abandoned in favor of an industrial LCD screen, but it still lacked the dimensionality of a CRT. The solution was for Iontank to mill a clear acrylic lens that mated perfectly with the original monitor housing and matched the original screen curvature. To complete the illusion, Iontank created a custom Amiga 1000 emulator and file system to allow users to explore the images themselves. The emulator even recreated the slow disk access and lag of the beloved Amiga.</p><p> A second version of the Warhol Amiga system was also commissioned that allows users to experiment with a simulation of the GraphiCraft application Warhol had used. This Amiga lets visitors capture images using a digital camera and try their hand at creating Warhol-inspired artworks of their own.

      <p><span>For Jayson DeMers, tracking his employees’ productivity was an obvious choice when the pandemic hit. As the CEO of a productivity monitoring software company himself, DeMers was ahead of the curve. “We use Hubstaff here at EmailAnalytics for tracking hours,” he told the Business of Business. Hubstaff tracks the amount of time contractors spend on tasks, taking random screenshots as evidence. “And for email productivity, we use our own app, EmailAnalytics.”</span></p>
<p><span>EmailAnalytics silently tracks employees’ email activity and displays it in&nbsp;interactive tables and graphs. Employers can track average email response time, top senders and recipients, and email activity by hour of the day or day of the week. In 2020, two years after its launch, demand in DeMers’ product grew with the widespread shift to work-from-home. From January to December of last year, EmailAnalytics’ organic users per month increased from a little under 10,000 to nearly 25,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“People behave differently when they know they're being monitored or held accountable for their on-the-clock activity,” DeMers says. “I've had unfortunate experiences in the past, before implementing monitoring tools, so these days I just get ahead of the problem and prevent it before it can start.”</span></p>
<p><span>Hubstaff and EmailAnalytics are far from the only productivity monitoring software companies benefitting from the COVID crisis. Awareness Technologies, the parent company of InterGuard, a market leader in employee monitoring software, claimed the company had seen three to four times growth in its customer base during the first two months of the pandemic. (Hubstaff made a similar </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/employee-monitoring-tools-see-uptick-as-more-people-work-from-home.html"><span>claim</span></a><span>, saying the number of companies trialing its technology grew by two to three times in the same period.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Competitors in "bossware" battle it out&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;use&nbsp;of productivity monitoring software, or “bossware,” has been&nbsp;growing&nbsp;for years, and WFH accelerated and normalized the trend.&nbsp;A 2019&nbsp;Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-future-of-employee-monitoring/">survey</a> of 239 corporations found that more than half were already employing “nontraditional monitoring techniques.” The&nbsp;market's&nbsp;expansion reveals itself in some of the key players’ web traffic data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Workpuls’ daily pageview count shot up over 1000% from 2019 to 2020, reaching an average of 1.9 million in December. Time Doctor, yet another competitor in the productivity monitoring software space, hit 5.9 million average daily pageviews in July after hovering around 2 million throughout 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past two years, ActivTrak’s daily average has soared over 200%. The company’s web traffic has been climbing since 2019, when it hit 3.9 million daily pageviews. From March to July of last year, pageviews increased by 153% to a daily average of 5.6 million.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Teramind, a computer monitoring software company that specializes in workplace productivity tools, peaked at 9.9 million daily pageviews last July, up from July 2019’s 1.1 million average. That’s a whopping 800% increase.</span></p>

<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://honestlydebatable.substack.com/p/ethical-musings-on-bossware-and-its"><span>data gathered by Elise DeCamp</span></a><span> of the early stage VC firm Bloomberg Beta,&nbsp;most&nbsp;bossware companies lack any major venture capital. Veriato, Hubstaff, Vericlock, and Interguard have not listed raising any capital on Crunchbase. ActivTrak, Teramind, and Workpuls are the lone leaders, the only ones that have raised capital. ActivTrak recently raised $70 million in a Series B, Teramind has raised $6 million since its 2014 launch, and Workpuls launched in 2016 with seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the biggest companies in the world use bossware, DeCamp points out. Instacart, Groupon, and Ring all use Hubstaff. Time Doctor counts 83,000 customers, including Allstate, Ericsson, Verizon, and Re/Max. ActivTrak is used by over 6,500 organizations, including Arizona State University, Emory University, and the cities of Denver and Malibu.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Taking pageviews, clientele, and funding into account, ActivTrak seems to be the present winner. What’s more? ActivTrak partners with Okta, the cybersecurity unicorn that’s publicly traded with a $34 billion market cap.</span></p>
<h2><span>Typical features&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>Bossware collects basically everything that happens on a device. The most common feature is “activity monitoring," which includes a log of applications and websites that workers use. Sometimes it will keep track of who they contact via email and posts on social media. Many tools&nbsp;record&nbsp;how much a user types and clicks to provide&nbsp;<span>minute-by-minute productivity reports and charts</span>. Most services&nbsp;take frequent screenshots of workers' screen and display them on daily timelines. Keylogger functions record&nbsp;workers' keystrokes, including unsent emails, private passwords, and other personal data. Some&nbsp;services&nbsp;go as far as tracking employees' GPS&nbsp;locations and activating webcams and microphones on worker devices.</p>
<p>Below is a breakdown of leading surveillance services' main features,&nbsp;based on research done by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/inside-invasive-secretive-bossware-tracking-workers">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2>Inherent risks for&nbsp;all parties&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span>Some employers will be transparent with their workers about using productivity monitoring services. “What I have learned is that it's crucial to let employees know they're being monitored,” DeMers says. “That creates accountability, eliminates performance lapses, and boosts productivity.” Other companies, of course, make this information private, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;surveillance software&nbsp;helps them keep the secret.</span></p>
<p>Teramind and Time Doctor<span>&nbsp;</span>design&nbsp;their software&nbsp;to be as difficult to detect and remove as possible,&nbsp;similar<span>&nbsp;</span>to stalkerware.&nbsp;<span>InterGuard’s </span><a href="https://www.interguardsoftware.com/employee-monitoring-software/"><span>website</span></a><span> advertises that its “employee monitoring software can be silently and remotely installed, so you can conduct covert investigations [of your workers] and bullet-proof evidence gathering without alarming the suspected wrongdoer.”&nbsp;</span><span>This evidence can be used to “fight wrongful termination suits.” In other words, employers can secretly collect their workers' private information</span><span>&nbsp;to use against them and deflect blame if a worker were to&nbsp;</span><span>take legal action against unfair treatment</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Employers’ use of surveillance software is technically legal and specific rules vary from state to state. But laws around consumer data privacy are evolving alongside productivity monitoring tools. The potential future risk for these software companies and the organizations using their services is uncertain.&nbsp;</span><span>And while many employers using the software report positive feedback, the lack of privacy doesn’t just threaten the workers’ security, it could work against the companies’ bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span>“The irony of it is [productivity monitoring software] is going to lead to less productivity, because there's less trust...it creates more resentment,” Josh Davies, CEO at the Center for Work Ethic Development, says.&nbsp;</span>“I think it truly has to be a human solution. People forget the things that are most effective in managing people are still high touch skills. Rather than having an electronic watchdog, we can build the trust that the work is going to get done. The idea that you're constantly checking in only further erodes the trust that you need to have as an organization during this time of remote work.”</p>
      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCommit-Container">
      <p>
        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span>git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitTag-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git tag name</span> will create a new tag named "name".
        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span>git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git tag</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitBranch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branches can be deleted using the command <span>git branch -d name</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git branch</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.<br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span>git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.<br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span>git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span>, <span>git branch</span>,
        and <span>git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span>git branch</span> and <span>git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span>git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span>git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span>git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span>git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.<br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span>git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span>git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span>git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span>git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span>git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span>git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.<br>
        You can do so by typing <span>git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span>git clean -df</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetchRebase-Container">
      <p>
        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code
        from the origin server's master branch. To update your local branch, you can do it without having to switch branches!
      </p>
      <p>
        First do a <span>git fetch</span>, then type <span>git rebase origin/master</span>!
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitDeleteBranches-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch -d</span> is used to delete branches.
        I have pre-created a bunch of branches for you to delete in the playground below.
        Have at it.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFree-Container">
      <p>
        Do whatever you want in this free playground.
      </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The more complex your system gets, the more we need to lean on the correct abstractions to keep things maintainable. This principle helps you keep your methods and functions focused, cohesive, and easy to understand in a system with several abstractions.</p></div><div id="html-wrapper"><div><p>Some people think programming is similar to story-telling. If that's the case, then <strong>good code is an incredibly boring and one-dimensional story</strong>. </p>
<p>Here are two stories.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/design-principles/maintain-a-single/two-stories.png" alt="Two stories - mixed abstractions"></p>
<p>Be honest. Which of those two stories did you finish reading? <strong>The first one, right</strong>? </p>
<p>But why? </p>
<p>Well, the <em>first story</em> is quick and succinct. We get a birds-eye view of what's going on, and if we're curious to know more, we can ask and go a level deeper. The <em>second story</em> gives us everything. And it's pretty fatiguing.</p>
<hr>
<p>The more complex your system becomes, the more you need to lean on abstractions to keep code readable and maintainable.</p>
<p>Since much of software development is <strong>reading code</strong>, using encapsulation and information-hiding to abstract away complexity and lower-level details becomes critical. </p>
<p>Used correctly, the plus side of this is that we end up with code that's easier to read, easier to ramp up and learn the domain, and it <em>can</em> — along with tests, even act as the primary form of documentation.</p>
<p>Used <em>incorrectly</em>, or <em>not at all</em>, we end up with <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/leaky-abstraction">leaky abstractions</a>, poor cohesion, and (since "we're always building an API") poor APIs for our fellow teammates and future maintainers to build on top of. </p>
<p>Therefore, the object-oriented design principle in question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintain a Single Layer of Abstraction at a Time (or <em>in other words,</em> Don't Mix Different Levels of Abstractions)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By maintaining a single layer of abstraction at a time, we write <strong>more</strong> <strong>cohesive</strong> and <strong>loosely coupled</strong> functions, methods, classes, and modules, which in turn improves the <em>readability</em> and <em>maintainability</em> of your code.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at this and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisite-reading">Prerequisite reading<a href="#Prerequisite-reading" aria-label="Prerequisite reading permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Before reading this article, I highly recommend the following. I've noted the relevant takeaways from each, but I recommend reading them if you find yourself confused or you don't find yourself aggressively nodding your head in agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/coupling-cohesion-connascence">Coupling, Cohesion &amp; Connascence</a> — Entropy (complexity) is at the heart of what makes it hard to write software. To tame complexity, we decompose the problem into smaller parts. But software is only useful when those parts are connected. Coupling and cohesion are the two best measurements of the quality of our decomposition attempts. We should strive for <strong>loose coupling</strong> and <strong>high cohesion</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>(Abstraction) Layers | Wiki</strong> — We use layers (domain, application, infrastructure, and adapter) to decompose a web application's complexity into separate concerns. The introduction of layers means more classes (and evidently, the coupling between layers of classes  — though we can use <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/tutorials/dependency-injection-inversion-explained/">Dependency Inversion</a> to mitigate this). Still, <strong>it can bring the benefit of higher cohesion within classes</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/leaky-abstraction">Leaky abstractions</a> — If we need to know about an object's internals to use it correctly, depending on the layer of abstraction, we may be leaking implementation details. This leads to <strong>lower cohesion</strong> and <strong>tighter coupling</strong> between components.</li>

<h3 id="Whats-happening-here">What's happening here?<a href="#Whats-happening-here" aria-label="Whats happening here permalink"></a></h3>
<p>The <code>habitsPage</code> is an abstraction over a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> instance that loads and stores habits from my Notion habits page. We then create a <code>CalendarService</code> (domain service) by passing in both a <code>habits</code> collection and a <code>calendar</code> object.</p>
<p>We then run a series of <code>Promise.all</code> statements, passing the create, update, and delete actions to the correct <code>googleCalendar</code> method.</p>
<p>Finally, we tell the <code>habitsPage</code> to clean up — and by this, we're really telling the Puppeteer instance to destroy itself to free up resources.</p>
<h2 id="Problems">Problems?<a href="#Problems" aria-label="Problems permalink"></a></h2>
<p>There are some subtle issues.</p>
<h3 id="Application-layer-responsibilities">Application layer responsibilities<a href="#Application-layer-responsibilities" aria-label="Application layer responsibilities permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Let's first remember the responsibilities of a use case in the <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/#3-Application-Logic--Use-Cases">application layer</a> in a layered (clean, hexagonal, etc.). Regarding the application layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains the features — the <em>use cases</em>, of our application</li>
<li>It is concerned with the rules that govern the application itself. For example, in a pet grooming application, a <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/#Domain-Layer">domain layer</a> business rule might state that <strong>a pet must have an owner</strong>. Such invariants could be enforced within <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/entities/">entities</a>, <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-value-object/">value objects</a>, and <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/aggregate-design-persistence/">aggregates</a> within the domain layer. Conversely, an application layer rule might enforce the fact that you can only <strong>edit a grooming appointment</strong> <strong>if you're one of many owners of the pet (authorization logic)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/application-layer-use-cases/">use cases</a> (one of the main implementation patterns from the application layer) primarily exist to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve domain objects from IO (using <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/repository-dto-mapper/">repositories</a> to databases or adapters to external APIs) so that it orchestrate the execution domain objects' encapsulated business rules and persist any events or state changes they create.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/design-principles/maintain-a-single/application-layer.svg" alt="Application layer"></p>
<p>With that in mind, we can call out a few <em>leaking abstractions</em> in the first attempt of this design.</p>
<h3 id="Problem-1-Leaking-abstraction-Calling-load-on-the-habits-page">Problem #1: [Leaking abstraction] Calling <code>load</code> on the habits page<a href="#Problem-1-Leaking-abstraction-Calling-load-on-the-habits-page" aria-label="Problem 1 Leaking abstraction Calling load on the habits page permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Notice that the first thing we do in the <code>execute</code> method of the <code>SyncHabitsToCalendar</code> use case is to call <code>load(waitTimeInMilliseconds: number)</code> on the <code>habitsPage</code> object?</p>
<p>useCases/syncHabitsToCalendar.ts</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>SyncHabitsToCalendar</span> <span>implements</span> <span>UseCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>void</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Why should the use case need to know that we need to <code>load</code> the <code>habitsPage</code> before fetching something from it? If we didn't call <code>load</code> and instead just called <code>getAllHabits</code>, what would happen? </p>
<p>We'd always get an empty list back. Behind that <code>load</code> method is the process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting up a puppeteer browser instance</li>
<li>going to the page to load the habits</li>
<li>using cheerio.js to scrape the habits and parse them into domain objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Needing to call <code>load</code> before we can call <code>getAllHabits</code> is an example of a <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/leaky-abstraction">leaky abstraction</a>. We <em>appear</em> to abstract away the complex details of getting all the habits from my Notion page. Instead, we've shifted the knowledge required to utilize this object's API onto the user (which, in the real world, could be a coworker or a future maintainer). That's not great. </p>
<p>A leaky abstraction like this can lead to a lot of bugs, and evidently — frustration. </p>
<p><b>Bonus (aside)</b>: Mark Phillips (Supreme Dreams) has a really funny video that almost perfectly demonstrates the idea of a leaky abstraction in real life. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SupremeDreams_1/status/1294011465259790339">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, we could relocate the logic to a better place: inside the <code>HabitsPage</code> class. Here, we encapsulate knowing when to call <code>load</code> in <code>HabitsPage</code> with the following:</p>
<p>services/HabitsPage.ts</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>HabitsPage</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>getAllHabits</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Promise</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Habits</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>	  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasLoadedHabits</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><span>	    <span>await</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>5000</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><span>	  <span>}</span></span>	
	  <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>habits<span>;</span>
	<span>}</span><span></span>
<span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Client usage in the use case looks like this now:</p>
<p>useCases/syncHabitsToCalendar.ts</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>SyncHabitsToCalendar</span> <span>implements</span> <span>UseCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>void</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Labeling Problem</h2><p>The efficacy of a machine learning model is limited to the quality and quantity of data being used to train the model. The most powerful models typically require massive amounts of data to train. If the target variables in the model are categorical, there is an equally massive amount of labels in the dataset. Unfortunately, most of these labels are done by hand-- a painstakingly slow and resource intensive process. The time and resources that come with labeling datasets by hand creates inefficiencies in many machine learning pipelines. The categorical datasets that data scientists and programmers often learn from – such as those hosted on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository </a>or those preprocessed and uploaded to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> – are idealized cases that do not reflect the typical reality of handling categorical data. In these datasets, someone has already taken the time to clean and process the data, providing the labels needed to train machine models. In real-life cases, this is usually not the case.</p><p>The origin of the categorical data labels often varies with the type of data in question. For example, pattern-recognition algorithms are often trained on labels provided through crowdsourcing. An algorithm trying to distinguish dogs from cats in images relies on humans to label each image beforehand. In ambiguous images, multiple people can assign different labels, resulting in a lower confidence for each category. On the other hand, medical diagnoses are often given in degrees of confidence either by some predefined test or by the doctor themselves. Similarly, natural language processing algorithms use confidence metrics to evaluate which definition of a word to employ (and, therefore, which meaning is intended) based on the context in which it is used. Despite the apparent categorical nature to these use cases, the reality can be quite the opposite.</p><p>Common in all of these cases is the association of a <em>probability </em>with the label. Whether the probability is simply an ensemble of multiple labels or intrinsic to the labeling methodology, the machine learning algorithms that train on these datasets must be able to handle probabilistic data labels. In some sense, the probability of a label is more informative than the label itself, as it also conveys the degree of confidence for a given observation. Understanding how to take advantage of this, and which approaches to handling these probabilistic data labels produce better models is a practical skill for data scientists and programmers encountering real-world categorical datasets. Additionally, tools that speed up or automate the labeling process in the machine learning pipeline resolve the inefficiencies that come with human labeling. Programmatically labeling is one such approach to do so.</p><p>In this tutorial, I use Python to walk through several different approaches to using probabilistic data labels to train machine learning models. I use a dataset that has both probabilistic labels and true labels to show that, if the probabilistic labels are of high quality, they are more than sufficient in constructing high performance machine learning models.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>To follow along with the code in this tutorial, you’ll need to have a recent version of Python installed. I use the <a href="https://anaconda.org/">Anaconda Navigator</a> for all my programming needs, but the code used in this tutorial is generalized to work with any Python 3.7 distribution. To install Anaconda, go <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">here</a>. &nbsp;You can find all of the code and data used on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/dsblendo/prob_data_labels">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>All of the packages I will be using are prebuilt into the Anaconda distribution, except for the <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras package</a>. Keras provides us with the building blocks to construct our neural nets. To install for use in Anaconda, we can use <a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> (you may also have to <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html">install conda-forge</a>):</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;conda install -c conda-forge keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>Alternatively, if you are using another Python distribution, you can install Keras with pip:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pip install keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>To import the necessary packages and functions that we will use, in Python run:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;<strong>import</strong> numpy <strong>as</strong> np<br><strong>import</strong> pandas <strong>as</strong> pd<br><strong>import</strong> matplotlib.pyplot <strong>as</strong> plt<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> accuracy_score<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> precision_recall_fscore_support <br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.model_selection <strong>import</strong> train_test_split<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.feature_extraction.text <strong>import</strong> TfidfVectorizer<br><strong>from</strong> keras.models <strong>import</strong> Model<br><strong>from</strong> keras <strong>import</strong> optimizers<br><strong>from</strong> keras.layers <strong>import</strong> Input, Dense, Dropout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>If any error indicates that a package cannot be found, simply install it using the same syntax as above, switching out the package name as needed. <br>‍</p><p>The data I will be working with is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wanderfj/enron-spam">Enron Spam classification dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset contains the text from 33,715 emails that are classified as either wanted (ham) or unwanted (spam). &nbsp;As can be seen below, the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; column contains the text of each email. We will use this text to train our model to classify the email as either ham or spam. </p><p>The &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column contains the ‘gold’ labels included in the original <em>.csv</em> file from Kaggle: 0 for ham and 1 for spam. There is an additional column that is not in the original Kaggle dataset: the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Pred&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;<em> </em>column<em>.</em> This column contains probabilistic labels from 0 to 100 (rather than the binary labels in the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column) that indicate the probability of each email belonging to the spam class. </p><p>These probabilities were programmatically labeled using <a href="https://www.watchful.io/">Watchful</a>, without looking at the original gold labels. It would take days for a human to label each email to by hand, while Watchful accomplished this in around 3 hours. &nbsp; </p><p>To import the dataset, we can use the<em> </em>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; package:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;file_path = 'watchful_export.csv'<br>email_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)<br>email_df.head()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>The output should look something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c4e081336a4_lMVu2dmf4RMJnd1IEucaulz17cuRIdK4qweUknWLuduEplP55gg4a9TYNu-OtnZW5uvadw8pTtl3fFnq3gPXhlkg4zbzD2azXTUmdcV5YOBF1R5BYANjItlhYmXjNmjbbkUR0zJD.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>All set? Let’s go.</p><h2>Exploring the Data</h2><p>Before we get to the model implementation, it is always a good idea to explore the data we are working with. We can also compare the probabilistic data labels provided by Watchful with the original gold labels and evaluate how well the algorithm did. In most real-life cases, this is not possible, as the true labels are either limited to a few observations, not known at all, or have poor quality. </p><p>First, it is worth looking at the distribution of spam and ham emails in the gold labels and the probabilistic labels. This gives us an idea of the balance of the dataset, as well as how well the probabilistic labels match up to the gold labels. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;gold_col_name = 'Spam_Gold'<br>pred_col_name = 'Spam_Pred'<br>text_col_name = 'Text'<br>pct_spam = email_df[gold_col_name].sum() / email_df.shape[0]<br>pct_ham = 1 - pct_spam<br>pct_spam, pct_ham&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c78a41336c8_VtYibTj6IYwpv8vQnofsEzLXZknIAdMi-NyTfM8ep6hDCBAIm1-nF7ZJGwK2hGhgq-Kv2n4XKObnIri8Nd9vTg8g8Jocgok0BPzgRvey6eUbl1xuCBdEanlQdeESi2KdGvf7yHlK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>So, the dataset has nearly an equal distribution of spam and ham emails. Dealing with sparse data is not trivial for most machine learning algorithms. Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about it. As, expected, the histogram of gold labels is nearly equal in height:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[gold_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c35f4133692__jnMfpcDBpKOL_PUwnyz0kWOWBaZaRA2v8hf5CsFdfQBMSTqqmR7qFd2chzDdjsKYgwmaUqsF_EZ_wPPfgxwp-Ylb0Y6IW8y8XqSSVaEPKIk63E6mKwMKt2rC4cdQXP9nrCRJ-Fp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And for the probabilistic labels:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[pred_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551ccb721336ec_fcbwX4G08cR9jGH2dHljz611Pmh4PXe1xLE_1hRmApL3Bx-qTG5nMZwTQS9g141qSpW2Bk6JktXXrvBjayV8Hw41vqpGso3MBR8Hi8Lni2nwtlaObjuu2IbQKwr_Y6NCP_Hs-dGc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distributions are pretty similar. This is an indication that the probabilistic labels assigned by Watchful are well aligned with the gold labels – a promising sign for being solely generated by the email text. </p><p>‍</p><p>From a qualitative perspective, certain characteristics of the emails are bound to correlate with either being spam or ham. For example, one could imagine that curt, plain text is probably not an advertisement for some product and is therefore an indicator of a ham email. On the other hand, text that is long and superfluous is generally more common in advertisements, and may indicate a spam email. </p><p>To get an idea of the distribution of the number of words used in the emails, we can take advantage of Python’s list comprehension syntax:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;lengths = np.array([len(doc.split()) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])<br>pd.DataFrame(lengths).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c243c1336b6_EYN_5xU56hJ15QgNOLP3EmEqd6gF-mP-PgWbdv-JyDiBLvPYUFapSe0m5yP1tZ_gS-OeoWU-JQrhyjCf04-MSbqO0DO30rd-X22ToTLL8M9bcYFkRTxlua8mGFmeB31oa226knO9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And to visualize the email length distribution:</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(lengths[lengths &lt; 1000])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c99b21336da_yrc6gT2jZBziyvh20WyReaApqY-f8qhxSmFPhCQCQI6wuX7bouHAKja3bGZlMy8knBZcVrh-9Qtlgnmc6GWxyv61Fz5YEGbK5DniKzEJmf7_wLRdUg3eSbGHnqk8JbGX-od97H__.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is heavily skewed, as expected for a text-based communication medium – most emails are relatively short, and the probability of a longer email scales inversely with the length. It is also worth looking at the number of unique words used in each email. This distribution should mimic the right-skewed distribution of the email word length. </p><div><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;vocabs = np.array([len(set(doc.split())) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])</p><p>pd.DataFrame(vocabs).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c88f91336fd_X4k57jF3VKR00pfNdxr0-ORZUR-251vs9tYtt_a1eS0qHzaZzbYzd70XF8woxKHUTIK8WWiXVT8fKhkhz2zU-DU0a6zWgIjreGsU3UJU1Y_HIekb1m_LuiOrrrVKstQwOdaxXXs5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(vocabs[vocabs &lt; 500])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c5422133707_or_uT0Z79lUjkht-xysIgvUqg6HoUvC-9EeyNSthoNmR_MvnxdxNlfhNDsi8d3ZyLcOYOglhndXgBIA9Zi3bmADhcXj4qcPMP1rOot2lrsndJ4u7THPsbl58L1RnIpAKUUrMVCNc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is reasonable relative to the email length distribution. One would expect that common articles (‘a’, ‘the’, ‘and’, etc.) &nbsp;are repeated several times in a given email, and the true number of unique words is 2-4x lower than the total number of words. We can also check how well the probabilistic labels align with the gold labels, assuming a probability higher than 50% indicates a spam. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;email_df[pred_col_name] = email_df[pred_col_name].apply(<strong>lambda</strong> r: 0 <strong>if</strong> r &lt; 50 <strong>else</strong> 1)<br>accuracy_score(email_df[gold_col_name], email_df[pred_col_name], <strong>True</strong>)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c6a16133706_Q83d1T3H5OHW4HC4iQ84zH8JVqFP9q83zDKUmhtQL21ZHkoJSBBmY5dXGJKjksN-Lt1Uvue8HguhFTD327Aziu14VYr25kjDwhiyvxUZzUDuqRoxqw3GGRW_I6RIyWhcCNm2Adts.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The agreement is pretty good assuming a simple 50% threshold.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In this blog post we’ll investigate certain advanced concepts related to Kubernetes init containers, sidecars, config maps, and probes. We’ll show you how to implement these concepts in your own cluster, but more importantly how to apply these to your projects in <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Release</a>&nbsp;for both fun and profit.</p><p>We’ll start with a brief introduction to pods and containers in Kubernetes, and then show specific examples of each item listed above. Below you will find a drawing of these examples to keep yourself oriented during our bumpy ride ahead.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/5StzQNBGjSiQRmuBATNdH1/c58328398227bd62299b87e5b70ed280/Understanding_Advanced_Kubernetes_Concepts.jpg" alt="Advanced Kubernetes Pod Concepts"></p><h2 id="key-kubernetes-pod-concepts">Key Kubernetes Pod Concepts</h2><p>Before we begin, let’s get a brief overview of some key concepts.</p><h3 id="container">Container</h3><p>In Docker, a container is an image that bundles layered filesystems which can be deployed as a runnable bundle. This container is usually built with a Dockerfile and has a startup binary or executable command.</p><h4 id="sidecar-container">Sidecar Container</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#how-pods-manage-multiple-containers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sidecar container</a>&nbsp;is simply a container that runs alongside other containers in the pod. There’s no official definition of a sidecar concept. The only thing that distinguishes a container as a sidecar container is that you consider it ancillary or secondary to the primary container. Running multiple sidecar containers does not scale well, but does have additional advantages of being able to reuse configuration files and container images. The reason sidecars do not scale well is that they may be overprisioned or wasteful based on the performance of the main application container. However, the tradeoffs can make sense in legacy applications or during migrations toward truly cloud-native designs.</p><h4 id="init-container">Init Container</h4><p>An <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">init container</a>&nbsp;is simply a container that runs before any other containers in the pod. You can have several init containers that run sequentially. As each container finishes and exits properly (with a zero!), the next container will start. If an init container exits with an error or if it does not finish completely, the pod could go into a <a href="https://releaseapp.io/blog/kubernetes-how-to-debug-crashloopbackoff-in-a-container" title="Read our other blog post on debugging the dreaded CrashLoopBackoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dreaded CrashLoopBackoff</a>. All of the containers share a filesystem, so the benefit here is that you can use or reuse container images to process, compile, or generate files or documents that can be picked up later by other containers.</p><h4 id="probes">Probes</h4><p>Although the word “probes” may stir up visions of Alien tools used for discovery and investigation of humans, fear not. These probes will only make your services run better! Kubernetes has <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">several probes</a>&nbsp;for defining the health of containers inside a pod. A startup probe allows the scheduler to tolerate delays in a slow-startup container. A liveness probe allows Kubernetes to restart a faulty or stalled container. A readiness probe allows a container to receive traffic only when it is ready to do so.</p><h3 id="pod">Pod</h3><p>You may harbour some fear in the back of your mind of “pod people” or vegetable clones grown to replace humanity with mindless zombies who hunt and destroy mankind. However, in Kubernetes, the smallest managed unit is the pod. But a pod could be composed of several containers that run in a single process space and filesystem. A pod is usually composed of one container that runs a single process as a service. However, there are several advanced usage examples we will go into that run multiple containers for expanded options and use cases.</p><h3 id="node">Node</h3><p>A Kubernetes node is ultimately a physical machine (which can have several layers of virtualisation) that runs the pod or pods, providing the critical CPU, memory, disk, and network resources. Multiple pods can be spread across multiple nodes, but a single pod is contained on a single node.</p><h3 id="volumes">Volumes</h3><p>Volumes are simply abstractions of filesystems that can be mounted inside containers. You cannot overlap or nest volume mounts. However, there are several mount types that might be very useful to your use case.</p><h4 id="configmap">configMap</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#configmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">configMap</a>&nbsp;is a so-called “blob” of information that can be mounted as a file inside your container. Remember, that this is not an evil, destructive blob out to devour our planet! It is a batch of text that is treated amorphously, like a… well… blob. The usual use case here is for a configuration file or secrets mount.</p><h4 id="emptydir">emptyDir</h4><p>An <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">emptyDir</a>&nbsp;is an empty filesystem that can be written into and used by containers inside a pod. The usual use case here is for temporary storage or initialization files that can be shared.</p><h4 id="hostpath">hostPath</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hostPath</a>&nbsp;is a filesystem that exists on the Kubernetes node directly and can be shared between containers in the pod. The usual use case here is to store cached files that could be primed from previous deployments if they are available.</p><h4 id="persistent-volume-claim-pvc">Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">persistent volume claim</a>&nbsp;is a filesystem that lasts across nodes and pods inside a namespace. Data in a PVC are not erased or destroyed when a pod is removed, only when the namespace is removed. PVCs come in many underlying flavors of storage, depending on your cloud provider and infrastructure architecture.</p><h3 id="namespace">Namespace</h3><p>A Kubernetes namespace is a collection of resources that are grouped together and generally have access to one another. Multiple pods, deployments, and volume claims (to list a few) will run together, potentially across multiple nodes.</p><h2 id="sidecars-and-init-containers">Sidecars and Init Containers</h2><p>The first use case we will cover involves running several containers inside a single pod. Once again, a pod here refers to one or more containers grouped together in Kubernetes, not vegetable human clones grown for evil reasons. In the following scenario, we will examine how multiple containers can share a single process space, filesystem, and network stack.</p><p>Keep in mind that most docker and Kubernetes purists will tell you that running more than one process in a container, or having more than one container in a pod is not a good design and will inevitably lead to scalability and architectural issues down the road. These concerns are generally well founded. However, careful application of the following supported and recommended patterns will allow you to thrive either during your transition from a legacy stack to Kubernetes or once you are successfully running your application in a cluster.</p><p>One particular use case we encounter with customers is that their application has a backend container that requires a reverse proxy like Nginx to perform routing, static file serving, and so forth. The best method to achieve this objective would be to create a separate pod with Nginx (for example) and run the two service pods in a single namespace. This gives us the flexibility to scale the backend pods and Nginx pods separately as needed. However, typically the backend service or application needs to also serve static files that are located inside the container filesystem and would not be available across the pod boundary. We agree this is not a preferred pattern to use, but it is common enough with legacy applications that we see it happen.</p><p>In this scenario, we often recommend a sidecar container running Nginx which can be pulled directly from Docker Hub or a custom image can be created. We also recommend that customers reuse their backend application container as an init container that starts with a custom command for creating any initialization or other startup tasks that need to be completed before the application itself starts.</p><p>One feature of this multi-container setup is that the Nginx container can use the “localhost” loopback to communicate with the backend service. Of course the sidecar container might be a logging or monitoring agent, but the principle is the same: the containers can speak with each other over a private network that is potentially not available outside of the pod, unless you make it available. In our Nginx example, the backend could be isolated so that all communication traffic inbound to the service container must be routed to the Nginx proxy.</p><p>The other nice feature of this configuration is that the containers all share a common file system so that the Nginx container can access static files generated by (or stored on) the backend service container.</p><p>Here is a link to our documentation that shows an example of running <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#sidecar-containers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sidecar</a> and <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#init-containers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">init</a>&nbsp;containers on Release.</p><h2 id="probes-1">Probes</h2><p>As we have noted, probes are not just for Aliens! Kubernetes uses them to test your application stack and report on its health. Kubernetes will also take action based on these probes, just like an Alien might. There are several probes that are supported natively by Kubernetes. The main use cases we support for our customers are the liveness probe and readiness probe.</p><p>The liveness probe is a way to test whether a container is “alive” or not, and if it fails the probe, then Kubernetes will restart the container. We usually recommend that your application not freeze up or have memory leaks and so forth so that a liveness probe should not be necessary. This “reboot your app to fix the problems” philosophy is not generally considered good practice. However, perfect code is impossible and when services are running in a production container environment, we know that almost anything can (and will) happen.</p><p>The readiness probe is a way to test whether a container is capable of serving traffic or not, and if it fails the probe, then the service port will be removed from the ingress controller. Contrary to our stance on the liveness probe, we strongly encourage and recommend that customers implement a readiness probe on any service that receives inbound traffic. In some sense, we consider a readiness probe mandatory for your production services.</p><p>Here is a link to our documentation that shows an example of using a <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#readiness-and-liveness-probes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">liveness and readiness probe</a>&nbsp;for services running in Release.</p><h2 id="volumes-1">Volumes</h2><p>This section gets a bit technical and tricky. Of course, no actual customer stacks would use every single type of volume, container, and probe listed in this article. But we do hope this overview shows all the features that are possible. You should carefully consider the use cases presented below and choose the one that best fits your use case.</p><p>Here is a link to our documentation that shows options for our <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">storage volume types</a>.</p><h3 id="configmap-just-in-time-file-mounts">configMap (Just in Time File Mounts)</h3><p>A …</p></div></article></div>

<p><span>With Manta Ray, DARPA hopes to field a payload-capable UUV able to operate for long-duration, long-range missions in ocean environments. One of the most critical components of Manta Ray is the development of new undersea energy harvesting techniques that could end up having an immense impact on all sectors of the naval and maritime industry.&nbsp;</span></p>

Some of DARPA’s requirements for Manta Ray are classified and remain unknown. The initial proposers day session was classified at the SECRET level, and potential proposers had to hold, at minimum, an active SECRET clearance to attend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After reviewing submitted proposals, in March of 2020, </span><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-03-10"><span>DARPA awarded contracts</span></a><span> to four companies to work on the Manta Ray program. Three of the awardees – Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories, Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, and Martin Defense Group, LLC (then Navatek, LLC) – were selected to work on the overall Manta Ray platform. A fourth company, Metron Inc., was chosen to work specifically on undersea energy harvesting technologies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This week, DARPA announced the completion of preliminary design reviews and that three of the previously selected four companies were chosen to advance their Manta Ray concepts. In an </span><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2021-02-05a"><span>announcement, </span></a><span>DARPA said Northrop Grumman and Martin Defense Group were chosen to move forward with overall vehicle design in preparation for vehicle fabrication and testing. Additionally, Metron, Inc. will continue working on energy solutions for the prototype UUVs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The goals of this new class of undersea vehicle and its critical component technologies are to inform, as well as transition into, future Navy UUV efforts,” said CDR Kyle Woerner, program manager for Manta Ray.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The Department of Defense has identified the development of both underwater and </span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/ghost-fleet-overlord-passes-latest-sea-trials/"><span>surface unmanned vehicles</span></a><span> as a pressing need for the U.S. Navy right now. A </span><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R45757.pdf"><span>Congressional Research Service report,</span></a><span> issued in late December 2020, notes the Navy’s desire to rapidly field unmanned vehicles into its fleets “can be viewed as an expression of the urgency that the Navy attaches to meeting future military challenges from countries such as China.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The U.S. Navy has a couple of different large-scale underwater drones currently in development. The </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2019/12/17/the-us-navys-new-orca-drone-submarine-could-get-offensive-role/?sh=32821fc60ca9"><span>Boeing Orca</span></a><span> intends to be an “extra-large” UUV, capable of launching from a forward operating port or pier and capable of deploying modular payloads, including underwater mines. Meanwhile, another program, code-named “</span><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/38443/snakehead-will-be-the-largest-underwater-drone-that-u-s-nuclear-submarines-can-deploy"><span>Snakehead</span></a><span>,” will be a large-displacement unmanned undersea drone that can be carried and deployed by nuclear-powered submarines.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>A June 2020 </span><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2020/06/01/to-compete-with-china-an-internal-pentagon-study-looks-to-pour-money-into-robot-submarines/"><span>study of future Navy force-level requirements</span></a><span> by the DoD recommended, among other things, a future Navy would need as many as 50 extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles or XLUUV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>&nbsp;Manta Ray Could Be a Renewable Energy Game Changer</h2>
<p><span>DARPA aims to add UUV capable of persisting underwater for extremely long durations to the Navy’s emerging unmanned fleet. To accomplish this, the most critical goal of Manta Ray involves advancing undersea energy management techniques.</span></p>
<p><span>To date, renewable naval propulsion has either involved human-propelled vessels or sail-powered ships. One is extremely labor-intensive, the other uncontrollable and dependent on when and where the breeze blows. Modern alternative methods, such as coal and oil, are costly, require frequent refueling, and negatively impact the environment. Meanwhile, advanced techniques involving nuclear reactors require large vessels, are expensive, and pose potential hazards to the crew and environment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For small underwater drones, which cannot carry a nuclear reactor or large-capacity batteries, to carry our long-term underwater missions, the development of novel energy technologies is an absolute necessity. As a </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/03/f61/Chapter%203.pdf"><span>Department of Energy (DOE) report</span></a><span> on underwater vehicle charging notes, “Although AUVs [autonomous underwater vehicles] are a cheaper alternative to traditional vessels, power capacity of the vehicle’s battery remains a limiting factor and keeps their missions limited in range and duration, often as little as 24 hours.”&nbsp;</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-85348" data-id="85348"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span>Underwater docking and recharging stations could extend mission duration for UUVs. However, as the DOE notes, “underwater docking stations are under development and not yet available commercially as they lack a practical power generation source.”</span></p>
<p><span>With Manta Ray, DARPA plans to advance critical technologies that could ultimately benefit future UUV designs, including the development of:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Novel energy management techniques for UUV operations and undersea energy harvesting techniques at operationally relevant depths.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Low-power, high-efficiency undersea propulsion systems.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>New low-power means of underwater detection and classification of hazards or counter detection threats;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Mission management approaches for extended durations while accounting for dynamic maritime environments;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Unique approaches for leveraging existing maritime data sets and exploiting novel maritime parameters for high-efficiency navigation and/or C3; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>New approaches to mitigate biofouling, corrosion, and other material degradation for long-duration missions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Ultimately, Manta Ray and the development of new novel underwater energy methods could end up being one of the biggest game-changers in modern naval history. “If successful, this new class of UUV will give the combatant commander an amplification of capacity without disrupting current operations by remaining independent of manned vessels and ports once deployed,” notes a </span><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/manta-ray"><span>statement</span></a><span> provided by DARPA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In hopes of discovering a breakthrough undersea energy solution, Manta Ray program participant Northrop Grumman </span><a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/sea/mission-unlimited-inventing-autonomous-recharging-of-unmanned-underwater-vehicles/"><span>announced a partnership</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://seatrec.com/contact/"><span>Seatrec</span></a><span>, a California company that focuses on harvesting renewable energy for underwater drones. Seatrec holds </span><a href="https://seatrec.com/technology/"><span>multiple patents and has invented several products</span></a><span> that extract energy from the ocean’s thermal gradient – the difference in temperature between warmer mixed water near the surface and colder water below — and converting it to electricity.</span></p>
<p><span>Later this year, the three selected contractors will advance their Manta Ray designs toward maturity before an anticipated “Phase 2” involving fabrication and testing will begin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Manta Ray performers have each taken unique approaches to solving the wide range of challenges related to UUV endurance,” said CDR Woerner. “To me, this is a clear sign we are tackling a complex problem without a clear ‘one size fits all’ solution.”</span></p>

For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.”<br></p><h3>PayPal Furthers Understanding and Acceptance of Crypto</h3><p>In late 2020, Another U.S.-based financial services provider, PayPal, launched a new feature enabling users to buy, hold, and sell crypto (namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin for now) from their PayPal accounts.<br></p><p>By legitimizing crypto as a funding source for purchases at any of the 26 million merchants around the world where PayPal works, <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">the company aims to “significantly increase cryptocurrency's utility”</a> as well as consumer understanding of the digital currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Fidelity First of Its Kind to Go Digital (Assets, That Is)</h3><p>In the first quarter of 2019, one of the largest asset management firms in the world with approximately $3.3 trillion in assets under management — Fidelity Investments Inc. — started offering Bitcoin custody services via their subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets.<br></p><p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/12/09/fidelity-digital-assets-now-allows-bitcoin-as-collateral/" target="_blank">Fidelity graduated from just custody operations</a> to launch a Bitcoin mutual fund that’s available to accredited investors. In addition, there’s Fidelity Charitable, which accepts donations in the form of digital currencies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>These developments make Fidelity, founded in 1946 in Massachusetts, one of the first among “traditional” financial firms to dive into the world of alternative assets.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration</h3><p>In a 2019 report aptly titled “Cryptoassets: Venture into the Unknown,” the widely-trusted global investment and advisory firm <a href="https://medium.com/@HuttCapital/reflecting-on-cambridge-associates-blockchain-investment-research-piece-d06bc3af0469" target="_blank">Cambridge Associates recommended that institutional investors start exploring digital assets</a> such as crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And exploring they are.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-cbf9a7f1-26c6-7b12-ee8a-199aab191383-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/601862c7623399e336716e88_vZliBvVna390iTpE6RPBeYNkYAtJhtHY_Zc5tsRZQois0d2ijFclg9fdamUMoMGbjAXS8zjeibDjWv1IqZANfh70GK2-nhHhIQN2jC-UU_R4zKoNna1x2TJZIYA5DkKERl6fhoTZ.png" alt="Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration"></p></figure><p>According to a study by the relatively new subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets, nearly 80% of the 774 American and European <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment">institutional investors they surveyed found digital assets “appealing.”</a>‍</p><p>In fact, close to 40% had already invested in digital assets and 60% said it was only a matter of time before they’d be adding digital assets to their portfolios. Bitcoin was the most popular digital asset among respondents.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“These results confirm a trend we are seeing in the market towards greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005138/en/Growing-Number-Institutional-Investors-Digital-Assets-Part" target="_blank">added president of Fidelity Digital Assets, Tom Jessop</a>. “This is evident in the evolving composition of our client pipeline, which spans from crypto native funds to pensions.” <br></p><h2>2021 Trends That May Further Crypto’s Acceptance</h2><p>As if major money authorities entering the crypto space isn’t enough, there are even more trends that show how crypto will continue to grow in mainstream acceptance in 2021 and beyond.<br></p><h3>A New American Administration Could Propel Crypto Forward</h3><p>January 20, 2021, marked a drastic shift in American politics as Joe Biden became the 46th president of the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful this new party will be more welcoming of digital currency, of which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-i-am-not-a-fan-of-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-105950093.html" target="_blank">the previous administration was “not a fan.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think we have opportunity in a Biden administration,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/11/biden-presidential-win-seen-as-a-good-thing-for-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think what we see with a Biden administration is an opportunity to get some fresh faces into the key regulatory agencies that might be more willing than some of the other regulators that we have today to move forward on policies that would be good for crypto.”<br></p><p>One such fresh face is Gary Gensler — former investment banker; current leader of the Biden–Harris transition's Federal Reserve, Banking and Securities Regulators agency review team; and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/gary-gensler-nominated-chair-sec-0119" target="_blank">nominee for the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fact that Gensler teaches courses on global economics and financial technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management is an indication that his involvement, as well as the involvement of others like him, mean good things for crypto’s advancement in American over the four years, at least.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Your Own Bank Might Even Get On Board With Crypto</h3><p>In the fall of 2020, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-crypto-exchange-secures-bank-charter-under-wyoming-law" target="_blank">Kraken was the first cryptocurrency firm in the U.S. to become a bank</a>, thanks to the special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter granted by the state of Wyoming — a surprising early supporter in the mainstream adoption of crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Then in January of 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency made a big move in the banking-digital currency relationship by <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-prices-jump-after-u-s-regulator-says-banks-can-use-stablecoin-connect-to-blockchains-11609811050#" target="_blank">releasing a letter to U.S. financial institutions permitting them to use stablecoins</a> (a type of cryptocurrency) and participate as nodes in a blockchain.<br></p><p>Translation? U.S. banks are officially legally authorized to deal in crypto-based transactions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We’re happy to agree with the Blockchain Association, <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1346233501604052992" target="_blank">which called the announcement</a> “ … a giant advance for crypto because it paves the way for these networks to be a formal part of the [U.S.] financial infrastructure.”<br></p><h3>Digital Currency Competitors Are Likely to Rise&nbsp;</h3><p>Noting the gradual — and recently, more meteoric — growth in the value of Bitcoin since it entered the spotlight, it’s only a matter of time before large companies get into the digital currency market.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And we think that’s a good thing. In addition to the options that more digital currencies introduce to consumers, they also put pressure on expensive and time consuming traditional transactions to do better.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Facebook’s (newly-named) <a href="https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/facebooks-diem-will-the-global-cryptocurrency-go-live-in-2021#:~:text=Facebook%20and%20the%20Diem%20Association,plans%20have%20been%20made%20official." target="_blank">Diem cryptocurrency is already slated to launch early in 2021</a>. And there are the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-coin-within-2-years-as-fangs-will-go-crypto-say-winklevoss" target="_blank">rumors among crypto insiders</a> that several of the other tech leaders are or will soon be working on their own digital currencies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If companies with the budget and reach of these global giants can get their digital currencies off the ground, we expect to see an explosion of interest in, understanding of, and eventual adoption of cryptocurrencies.<br></p><p>To sum it up very, very briefly: Crypto is going mainstream. That means it’s likely going to make up some element of your investment portfolio soon.<br></p><p>The problem? Your traditional financial tracker isn’t equipped to stay on pace with these rapid developments.<br></p><p>Here’s everything you need to know to keep up.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>What Makes Kubera the Best Financial Tracker in a World That’s Going Crypto</h2><p>If you’re like the vast majority of modern investors who need (or will soon need) their traditional portfolio management tools to work with alternative investments — you’re in for a bad ride.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s time to switch over to a financial tracker that’s built to manage all your assets, from the traditional to the alternative to the digital, in one place.<br></p><p>Kubera is a modern financial tracking app that was created by a small team of investors who needed a tool that could keep up with their portfolios, which consisted of a healthy mix of assets including different fiat and crypto currencies.<br></p><p>So that’s exactly what we built.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Intrigued? Here are the key features that we added into Kubera to make it an ideal tool for investors in an increasingly crypto world.<br></p><h3>We’re Always Building New Integrations with Leading Crypto Exchanges and Wallets</h3><p>Kubera was constructed with the belief that crypto is just as important to a portfolio as any other asset type, <em>not</em> an afterthought or add-on.<br></p><p>That’s why we’re able to integrate with more financial institutions than most other financial trackers.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/bank-investment-portfolio-auto-update">We already work with the leading aggregators</a> like Plaid, Yodlee, Salt Edge, and Zabo to connect with bank accounts, brokerages, financial apps, and crypto wallets and exchanges around the world.

<i id="2019-08-17">2019-08-17</i> Final report.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this 2019 Google Summer of Code project is to develop a tool with which to transparently proxy applications that use the Wayland protocol to be displayed by compositors. Unlike the original X protocol, only part of the data needed to display an application is transferred over the application's connection to the compositor; instead, large information transfers are made by sharing file descriptors over the (Unix socket) connection, and updating the resources associated with the file descriptors. Converting this side channel information to something that can be sent over a single data stream is the core of this work.
</p>
<p>
The proxy program I have developed for the project is called Waypipe. It can currently be found at <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/"><code>gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe</code></a>. (I am currently looking for a better stable path at which to place the project; the preceding URL will be updated once this is done.) A few distributions have already packaged the program; see <a href="https://repology.org/project/waypipe/versions">here</a>; alternatively, to build and run the project, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/blob/master/waypipe.scd">man page</a>. My work is clearly identified by the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/commits/master">commit logs</a>, and amounts to roughly ten thousand lines of C code, and a few hundred of Python. 
</p>
<h4>General overview</h4>
<p>
The following image shows the typical setup for the proxy. Two instances of the program must be run, a <code>waypipe server</code> on the remote system, and a <code>waypipe client</code> on the local system. The <code>waypipe server</code> pretends to be a Wayland compositor, and offers a Unix socket over which applications can connect. When they do so, a the <code>waypipe server</code> creates a new connection handling process, whose task it is to convert the Wayland protocol messages (and file descriptor updates) made by the application to a single data stream. The connection handler then connects to a Unix socket that is forwarded (via <code>ssh</code>) from a socket created by the <code>waypipe client</code> process. Messages to the communication channel are then decoded by another connection handler, which connects to the local Wayland compositor and pretends to be the remote application.
</p>
<img src="https://mstoeckl.com/notes/gsoc/processes.svg" width="80%">
<p>
The individual connection handlers leave the wire format of the Wayland protocol messages mostly unchanged, prefixing collections of messages with a lightweight header. Some editing is done, for instance to strip out messages advertising capabilities that can or should not be proxied (privileged graphics card access). File descriptors provided by either the application (or the compositor), on the other hand, are replaced by messages that tell the remote Waypipe instance to create a file descriptor with matching properties, and send it on to the compositor (or the application.) Additional messages are sent to replicate any changes to the local file descriptors.
</p>
<img src="https://mstoeckl.com/notes/gsoc/converter.svg" width="60%">
<p>
As the vast majority of file descriptor updates are changes to shared memory buffers (or <a href="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/driver-api/dma-buf.html">DMABUFs</a>) containing image data, I will only describe the main mechanism used to replicate changes. It is a standard technique for distributed shared memory; instead of sending the entire memory region when the Wayland protocol messages indicate that there is a change, Waypipe maintains a private copy of the each shared memory region, and only sends the data which has changed since the last time the private copy was synchronized with the shared memory region. The format used to track the changes is illustrated in the following image; it consists of a series of runs of changed data, prefixed by the range in the buffer to which the run corresponds.
</p>
<img src="https://mstoeckl.com/notes/gsoc/diff_routine.svg" width="80%">
<h4>Highlights, challenges, and more</h4>
<p>
Waypipe supports many quality of life features, including a user-friendly command line wrapper for ssh, hardware accelerated video encoding, transfer compression with either <a href="https://lz4.github.io/lz4/">LZ4</a> or <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">Zstd</a>, and a method to reconnect applications when the ssh connection breaks. With more recent kernels and versions of <a href="https://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa</a> that support DMABUFs (GPU-side buffers), it can proxy programs that render images using OpenGL.
</p>
<p>
The most difficult technical challenge with Waypipe so far has been the buffer management logic, and the way this interacts with multithreading and reconnection support. In addition to the expected overflow and race conditions bugs involved, it's been surprisingly difficult to find a simple way to satisfy all the requirements without performing extra memory copies or using dynamic memory allocation for <i>every</i> file descriptor update message sent over the communication channel. I've chosen to use <code>malloc</code> all over the place, and deal with all the error checking that involves. Due to the complexity involved (and the fact the decompression is generally faster than the network), I still don't have a multithreaded message decompression pathway.
</p>
<p>
There are a few things that I may yet implement in Waypipe over the next few months. As much of the code was written under the assumption that it would soon be rewritten, many of the error checking paths, especially those related to memory allocation failure, are incomplete or untested. There are also a few performance optimizations with the buffer change detection mechanism that I'd like to try, most notably using a fast hash function to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/issues/13">reduce memory bandwidth consumption</a>. It would also be nice to use the C11 atomic operations to reduce the amount of code in lock-protected critical sections, since lock holder preemption contributes to worst-case latency.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
<i id="2019-08-10">2019-08-10</i> As this GSOC project approaches its end, I've been testing and refactoring the code for <code>waypipe</code>. The only new feature of note is a <code>waypipe bench</code> subprogram, which makes it easier to estimate which compression settings, precisely, are appropriate for a combination of bandwidth and machine performance. The bandwidth must be specified on the command line, since real network stacks include buffering that would make online measurements very difficult. (The benchmark design implicitly assumes that decompression time on the remote machine never delays the critical path for a transfer, or at the very least, is far less significant than the compression algorithm and level settings.) The results of this program are mostly predictable. Because frames containing text tend to compress better than frames containing rendered 3d scenes or pictures, the compression level which minimizes transfer latency, at high bandwidths, is typically higher for text heavy images, since even fast compression methods offer significant space reduction. At low bandwidths, the reverse holds, since beyond a point images require enough transfer time that there is enough time for very high levels of compression.
</p>
<!--<p>
As for refactoring, I have been very slowly reorganizing the code for <code>waypipe</code> to improve modularity. (Slowly, because quite a few dependencies are unavoidable.) The source for <code>waypipe</code> is roughly organized into three groups of functions. First, there a core that deals specifically with file descriptor replication. Next, a ring of main loop code, which manages data transfers, parses the Wayland protocol and a number of auxiliary messages, and uses the results to call the core functions. Third, there is user interface code, which provides the file descriptors with which the main loop code communicates with the Wayland application and the other <code>waypipe</code> instance. The following diagram (produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen">Doxygen</a>) shows a subset of the <code>struct</code>s used by <code>waypipe</code>, specifically the ones visible from the protocol handling code; the bundles on the left side, centered around <code>struct shadow_fd</code> and <code>struct thread_pool</code>, are used mostly by the core code; those close to <code>struct globals</code>  and <code>struct message_tracker</code> are more closely tied to the main loop code.
</p>
<img src="usage_graph.svg" width="70%"/>-->
<p>
The remaining changes are varied. I've also extended support for DMABUFs to include some older versions of Mesa whose backends don't yet support the GBM modifier code. A crash or two introduced over the last few weeks has been fixed. The headless testing script now also checks that the reconnection support added a few weeks ago works. <code>waypipe</code> now compiles with <code>-Wconversion</code>, and some unnecessary wire format padding has been removed.
</p>

<p>
<i id="2019-08-03">2019-08-03</i> The result of all the diff construction testing and sample implementations ... is an unchanged diff format. In my opinion, the scenario that most needs optimization is when a small change is made to a large buffer, and detailed damage tracking is unavailable. Then the main source of delay in the program is the time needed to scan through the unchanged portion of the buffer. On the other hand, when most of the buffer has changed, the data transfer time (and any compression/decompression stages) will take enough time that a 5% increase in diff runtime will be hidden by the other operations. In essence, it's better to optimize the diff for text input than for games. Based on the target scenario, the <i>bitset</i> format was ruled out, because a 1/64th control data overhead is huge when only 1/1000th of the buffer changed, and the time needed to convert the bitset to another format added too much slowdown, even in the case where no data changed.  The <i>split</i> variation on the standard diff format was also discarded, as it required a bit more complexity to manage two buffers, while not significantly improving performance.
</p>
<p>
A key optimization used by the standard diff method is "windowing": small unchanged gaps in the data stream are still copied into the diff. This speeds up diff application, by reducing the number of chunks that must be <code>memcpy</code>'d, as well as the number of branch mispredictions, and makes it possible to limit the number of times that the diff construction routine must switch between copying data and not copying data. The maximal size gap to be skipped is still kept relatively small, to minimize both the total diff size and the total amount of data written. (It's currently at 256 bytes, and can't go any lower than 64 bytes without breaking a key optimization for the SIMD diff routines.)
</p>
<p>
A common optimization which does <i>not</i> work for the diff construction methods is to run the method fully branchlessly with a single loop. While this approach is probably worth it when just constructing a diff given two buffers, <code>waypipe</code>'s diff construction method also requires that the second buffer be updated to match the first. The fastest way to update the reference buffer, without introducing conditional code, is to mix a copy of the entire modified buffer into the diff routine. (Using masked writes to avoid actually rewriting the unchanged data is slower, due to high instruction latency.) As interleaving a data copy is still ≥ 10% slower than having a specialized loops to scan changed and unchanged data, with additional slowdown expected in conjunction with hyperthreading, the fully "branchless" approach is not worth it.
</p>
<p>
In other news, as I didn't have an AAarch64 system on hand, I upgraded a Raspberry Pi 4 from a 32-bit kernel and 32-bit userland to a 64-bit kernel and a mixture of 32-bit and 64-bit packages, with development tools consisting solely of the latter. From an existing Raspbian image, I first installed a <a href="https://github.com/sakaki-/bcm2711-kernel">64-bit …</a></p></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this post, which can be read as a follow-up to our <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">ultimate web scraping guide</a>, we will cover almost all of the tools Python offers to scrape the web. We will go from the basic to advanced ones, covering the pros and cons of each. Of course, we won't be able to cover every aspect of every tool we discuss, but this post should give you a good idea of what each tool does, and when to use one.</p>
<p><em>Note: When I talk about Python in this blog post you should assume that I talk about Python3.</em></p>
<h2 id="0-web-fundamentals">0. Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The internet is <strong>complex</strong>: there are many underlying technologies and concepts involved to view a simple web page in your browser. I don’t have the pretension to explain everything, but I will explain the most important to understand for extracting data from the web.</p>
<h3 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) uses a <strong>client/server</strong> model. An HTTP client (a browser, your Python program, cURL, Requests…) opens a connection and sends a message (“I want to see that page : /product”)to an HTTP server (Nginx, Apache…). Then the server answers with a response (the HTML code for example) and closes the connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP is called a <em><strong>stateless protocol</strong></em> because each transaction (request/response) is independent. FTP, for example, is stateful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the HTTP request looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">GET /product/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q<span>=</span>0.9,image/web<span>\
</span><span></span>p,*/*;q<span>=</span>0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6<span>)</span> AppleWebKit<span>\
</span><span></span>/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of this request, you can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GET verb or method: This means we request data from the specific path: <code>/product/</code>. There are other HTTP verbs, and you can see the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">here</a>.</li>
<li>The version of the HTTP protocol: In this tutorial we will focus on HTTP 1.</li>
<li>Multiple headers fields: Connection, User-Agent… Here is an exhaustive list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP headers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the most important header fields :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> This is the domain name of the server. If no port number is given, it is assumed to be <strong>80</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent:</strong> This contains information about the client originating the request, including the OS. In this case, it is my web browser (Chrome) on macOS. This header is important because it is either used for statistics (how many users visit my website on mobile vs desktop) or to prevent violations by bots. Because these headers are sent by the clients, they can be modified (<em>“Header Spoofing”</em>). This is exactly what we will do with our scrapers - make our scrapers look like a regular web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> These are the content types that are acceptable as a response. There are lots of different content types and sub-types: <strong>text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, application/json</strong> …</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> : This header field contains a list of name-value pairs (name1=value1;name2=value2). These session cookies are used to store data. Cookies are what websites use to authenticate users and/or store data in your browser. For example, when you fill a login form, the server will check if the credentials you entered are correct. If so, it will redirect you and inject a session cookie in your browser. Your browser will then send this cookie with every subsequent request to that server.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The Referrer header contains the URL from which the actual URL has been requested. This header is important because websites use this header to change their behavior based on where the user came from. For example, lots of news websites have a paying subscription and let you view only 10% of a post, but if the user comes from a news aggregator like Reddit, they let you view the full content. They use the referrer to check this. Sometimes we will have to spoof this header to get to the content we want to extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on…you can find the full header list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>A server will respond with something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">HTTP/1.1 <span>200</span> OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 <span>(</span>Ubuntu<span>)</span> Content-Type: text/html; charset<span>=</span>utf-8 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset<span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> /&gt; ...<span>[</span>HTML CODE<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>On the first line, we have a new piece of information, the HTTP code <code>200 OK</code>. This means the request has succeeded. As for the request headers, there are lots of HTTP codes. They are split into four common classes: 2XX for successful requests, 3XX for redirects, 4XX for bad requests (the most famous being “404 Not Found”), and 5XX for server errors.</p>
<p>Then, if you are sending this HTTP request with your web browser, the browser will parse the HTML code, fetch all the eventual assets (Javascript files, CSS files, images…), and render the result into the main window.</p>
<p>We will go through the different ways to perform HTTP requests with Python and extract the data we want from the responses.</p>
<h2 id="1-manually-opening-a-socket-and-sending-the-http-request">1. Manually Opening a Socket and Sending the HTTP Request</h2>
<h3 id="socket">Socket</h3>
<p>The most basic way to perform an HTTP request in Python is to open a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html">socket</a> and manually send the HTTP request.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> socket

HOST <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>www.google.com</span><span>'</span>  <span># Server hostname or IP address</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have the HTTP response, the most basic way to extract data from it is to use regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>A regular expression (RE or regex) is a search pattern for strings.</p>
<p>With regex, you can search for a particular character/word in a bigger body of text.</p>
<p>For example, you could identify all phone numbers in a web page.</p>
<p>You can also replace items with a regex. For example, you could replace all uppercase tags in a poorly formatted HTML with lowercase tags.</p>
<p>You can also validate some inputs …</p>
<p>The pattern used by a regex is applied from left to right, and each source character is only used once.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why it is important understand regular expressions when doing web scraping.</p>
<p>After all, there are many different Python modules to parse HTML, with XPath and CSS selectors.</p>
<p>In an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic world,</a> data is easily machine-readable, and the information is embedded inside relevant HTML elements, with meaningful attributes.</p>
<p>But the real world is messy. You will often find huge amounts of text inside a p element. For example, if you want to extract specific data inside a large text (a price, a date, a name…), you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is a great website to test your regex: <a href="https://regex101.com/"></a><a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>. Also, here is an <a href="https://www.rexegg.com/">awesome blog</a> to learn more about them. This post will only cover a small fraction of what you can do with regex.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can be useful when you have this kind of data:</p>
<p>We could select this text node with an Xpath expression and then use this kind of regex to extract the price:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>^</span>Price\s:\s(\d<span>+</span>\<span>.</span>\d{<span>2</span>})\<span>$</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To extract the text inside an HTML tag, it is annoying but doable to use a regex:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> re

html_content <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Price : 19.99$&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>

m <span>=</span> re<span>.</span>match(<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;(.+)&lt;</span><span>\</span><span>/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>, html_content)
<span>if</span> m:
	<span>print</span>(m<span>.</span>group(<span>1</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, manually sending the HTTP request with a socket and parsing the response with regular expression can be done, but it's complicated and there are higher-level API that can make this task easier.</p>
<h2 id="2-urllib3--lxml">2. urllib3 &amp; LXML</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It is easy to get lost in the urllib universe in Python. The standard library contains urllib and urllib2 (and sometimes urllib3). In Python3 urllib2 was split into multiple modules and urllib3 won't be part of the standard library anytime soon. This confusing situation will be the subject of another blog post. In this section, I've decided to only talk about urllib3 because it is widely used in the Python world, including by Pip and Requests.</p>
<p>Urllib3 is a high-level package that allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with an HTTP request. We urllib3 we could do what we did in the previous section with way fewer lines of code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
http <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>PoolManager()
r <span>=</span> http<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>http://www.google.com</span><span>'</span>)
<span>print</span>(r<span>.</span>data)
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this is much more concise than the socket version. Not only that, the API is straightforward. Also, you can easily do many other things, like adding HTTP headers, using a proxy, POSTing forms …</p>
<p>For example, had we decided to set some headers and use a proxy,
we would only have to do the following (you can learn more about proxy servers at <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/proxy-server/">bestproxyreviews.com</a>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
user_agent_header <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>make_headers(user_agent<span>=</span><span></span><span>"</span><span>&lt;USER AGENT&gt;</span><span>"</span>)
pool <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>ProxyManager(f<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;PROXY IP&gt;</span><span>'</span>, headers<span>=</span>user_agent_header)
r <span>=</span> pool<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>https://www.google.com/</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>See? There are exactly the same number of lines. However, there are some things that urllib3 does not handle very easily. For example, if we want to add a cookie, we have to manually create the corresponding headers and add it to the request.</p>
<p>There are also things that urllib3 can do that requests can't: …</p></div></div>

	<p>Clubhouse is a new social media app entirely based on audio-chat, where users enter â€˜roomsâ€™ where they can listen to a group of people talking to each other and possibly take part in the discussion. Clubhouseâ€™s terminology and structure are extremely reminiscent of text-based chats, especially IRC. The rooms, according to the developers of the app, encourage open conversations and the exchange of ideas. In fact, the rooms are often the broadcast channels of a few (sometimes supposed) celebrities, experts, and personalities from all walks of life who chat while a bunch of users listens to them without intervening.Â&nbsp;The app is also filled with chats among friends who discuss the most diverse topics.</p>
<p>The success of Clubhouse is very similar to that ofÂ&nbsp;PokÃ¨monÂ&nbsp;Go. When Nianticâ€™s game came out, it was summer, and millions of people were bewitched by the idea of hunting for little monsters in augmented reality. With the excuse of playing the game, people ended up walking for miles, thus using its health benefits to justify the digital neurosis. Today, on the contrary, we are isolated and locked inside our homes, and our social life has been reduced to a bare minimum. It seems unreal to us that we can open an app, join a conversation, have the impression of taking part in a symposium, and engage with a group of other faceless and disembodied voices â€“thus without the burden of Instagramâ€™s aesthetic comparisons, or Facebookâ€™s forced relationships.Â&nbsp;</p>

<article>
	<p>How did Clubhouse ascend so quickly to the Empyrean of social networks? Quite simply, by getting dozens of celebrities to talk about their own business or explain how they became successful thanks to their smartphones â€“ itâ€™s the Masterclass model â€“ and, as a result, convincing thousands of millennials, tired of the most popular social media apps, to join this manufactured pseudo-elite. A banal invite-only sign-up system managed to convince even the most skeptical, including those who see Facebook and Instagram as pure evil, to devote hours of their day to yet another creature of Silicon Valleyâ€™s billionaireÂ&nbsp;elites.</p>
<p>Clubhouse also has the advantage of appearing to be an independent app that has nothing to do with the profiling empires of Mr. Zuckerberg and his associates, a breath of fresh air in a market dominated by large groups and apps with billions of users. But thatâ€™s not quite right. The initial investment of ten million dollars came from Andreessen-Horowitz, also known as a16z, the Goldman Sachs of Silicon Valley startups. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz have become billionaires by investing in companies such as Facebook (Andreessen is still a member of the board chaired by Mark Zuckerberg), Instagram (before Facebook bought it), Pinterest, and many other successful social and digital ventures. In January of this year, the firm led a new $100m funding round, making Clubhouse reach a valuation of $1 billion.</p>

</article>
</div>

<div>

<article>
	<p>This makes us understand two things. Firstly, if you really wanted to feel like hipsters thanks to this new audio social network, well, this ship has long sailed. The pioneering era of Clubhouse has been over for at least a few months. The Android app is coming soon (for now, Clubhouse is only available for iOS), and one would think that the invitation system might also be removed (after all, you need a lot of users and their data to justify a $1 billion valuation). Secondly, Clubhouse is not an alternative to social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram, but rather a complementary service.</p>

		The result â€“ now that the elites have given way to mass invitations â€“ are random and disorganisedconversations that are only rarely interesting, and more often a source of unmoderated disinformation, similar to a background buzz, or improvised talk shows devoid of substance.
	</blockquote>

</div>
<div>

<article>
	<p>The new app, if anything, is bad news for the podcast market, which has been on the rise in recent years, and for those who have invested heavily in it â€“ like Spotify, for example. The ease with which you can create a room and start talking, in fact, is nothing more than a rapid disintermediation of the audio tool and a disruption of the only mainstream news sector that seemed to have withstood the impact of social media â€“ voice and radio. And what we are witnessing on Clubhouse is the prelude of aÂ&nbsp;trivialisationÂ&nbsp;of audio that will soon pass the point of no return. Whatâ€™s the point of investing in a good microphone, learning how to edit audio content, or â€“ God forbid â€“ thinking of something interesting to say? Just log in to Clubhouse, and off you go â€“ with bad but sufficient quality, you can immediately be part of an audience made of avatars, have the illusion of participating in a debate ignoring its ephemeral nature, and feel part of a crowd of opinion leaders (or an audience that has the illusion of being able to get in touch with theirÂ&nbsp;favourite celebrities). If you think this sounds like an exaggeration, maybe it's better to read what Andreessen-Horowitz has to say about that:</p>
<p>â€œIn a social media landscape that typically compels you to spend hours staring at a screen â€” often distractedly flitting between multiple screensâ€” Clubhouse lets you multitask while you listen. Like podcasts, you can listen while you take a walk, fold laundry, or work out. It can also be the centerpiece of your evening, like attending a lecture or talk. But itâ€™s also interactive, so if you have something to say, you can raise your hand and chime in. Because youâ€™re listening to people talk, Clubhouse is about a real-time exchange of ideas, not just consuming highly-edited, static content. Itâ€™s a fresh experience that brings humanity and context to online social engagementâ€�.Â&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The result â€“ now that the elites have given way to mass invitations â€“ are random andÂ&nbsp;disorganised conversations that are only rarely interesting, and more often a source of unmoderated disinformation, similar to a background buzz, or improvised talk shows devoid of substance. The experts are multiplying, and everyone suddenly has something to say and could go on for hours and hours about it. In the Italian rooms, everyone is an expert in digital ventures, journalism, new media, coaching, business development, or influence marketing. Nobody really bothers to check the qualifications or the credibility of the person speaking. Most people just listen and delude themselves into thinking theyâ€™ve learnt something new from a conversation they barely paid attention to while walking their dog.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Clubhouse has already proved to be a successful experiment, notwithstanding what it will become with the arrival of the multitudes â€“ or, to quote Byung-ChulÂ&nbsp;Han, the bulk of the swarm. With a $1 billion valuation, it is already another â€“ of the many â€“ Silicon Valley projects to which we willingly accept toÂ&nbsp;devoteÂ&nbsp;our time, our mental resources, and our precious attention. Attracted by gratuitousness, novelty, and an exclusivity that is not such, once again we gladly turn ourselves into products, contributing toÂ&nbsp;centralisingÂ&nbsp;value and money towards the usual small circle of rich and privileged male-dominated tech elites.Â&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>curl is an internet transfer engine. A rather modular one too. Parts of curl’s functionality is provided by selectable alternative implementations that we call <em>backends</em>. You select what backends to enable at build-time and in many cases the backends are enabled and powered by different 3rd party libraries.</p>



<h2>Many backends</h2>



<p>curl has a range of such alternative backends for various features: </p>



<ol><li>International Domain Names</li><li>Name resolving</li><li>TLS</li><li>SSH</li><li>HTTP/3</li><li>HTTP content encoding</li><li>HTTP</li></ol>



<h2>Stable API and ABI</h2>



<p>Maintaining a stable API and ABI is key to libcurl. As long as those promises are kept, changing internals such as switching between backends is perfectly fine.</p>



<p>The API is the armored front door that we don’t change. The backends is the garden on the back of the house that we can dig up and replant every year if we want, without us having to change the front door.</p>



<h2>TLS backends</h2>



<p>Already back in 2005 we added support for using an alternative TLS library in curl when we added support for GnuTLS in addition to OpenSSL, and since then we’ve added many more.  We do this by having an internal API through which we do all the TLS related things and for each third party library we support we have code that does the necessary logic to connect the internal API with the corresponding TLS library.</p>



<h2>rustls</h2>



<p>Today, we merged support for yet another TLS library: <strong><a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">rustls</a></strong>. This is a TLS library written in rust and it has a C API provided in a separate project called <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/crustls/">crustls</a>. Strictly speaking, curl is built to use crustls.</p>



<p>This is still early days for the rustls backend and it is not yet feature complete. There’s more work to do and polish to apply before we can think of it as a proper competitor to the already established and well-used TLS backends, but with this merge it makes it much easier for more people to help out and test it out. Feel free and encouraged to join in!</p>



<p>We count this addition as the <strong>14th</strong> concurrently supported TLS library in curl. I’m not aware of any other project, anywhere, that supports more or even this many TLS libraries.</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot_2021-02-09-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png"><img loading="lazy" width="2523" height="1419" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot_2021-02-09-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""></a></figure>



<h2>rustls again!</h2>



<p>The TLS library named <a href="https://mesalink.io/">mesalink</a> is actually already using rustls, but under an OpenSSL API disguise and we support that since a few years back…</p>



<h2>Credits</h2>



<p>The TLS backend code for rustls was written and contributed by Jacob Hoffman-Andrews.</p>

	<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Microsoft’s portable system’s logo was a Windows flag within a circle. <em>Yuri Litvinenko / 30pin</em> </p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If we chronicled every move Microsoft has made to capture markets beyond general computing, the record would span 30 years of one-offs, obscurities, and commercial flops. While the company did secure its position in the gaming market with the Xbox, its other home appliances and personal gadgets were far less successful.</p><p>Microsoft can’t be blamed for not trying hard enough, though—at least, if we are talking about the sheer variety of approaches. They tried both <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/zune-13-years-old-and-long-gone-it-left-impression-me-forever">following</a> the leader and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/lessons-learned-from-microsofts-pioneering-and-standalone-smartwatches/">coming up</a> with novel concepts; <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/compcol/082697compcol-manes.html">collaborating</a> with household brands or <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/microsoft-to-axe-nokia-brand-in-favour-of-microsoft-lumia/">dismissing</a> them aggressively; <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1997/04/06/microsoft-to-acquire-webtv-networks/">acquiring</a> companies or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-05-08-microsoft-portable-media-center-rip-2004-2006.html">licensing</a> technologies to them.</p><p>One of the things Microsoft had to offer to gadget makers was an operating system which, at a glance, closely resembled their most famous creation: Windows. In the late 1990s, the four-color flag, already synonymous with PCs by that point, appeared on the predecessors of modern phones and tablets. That system continued to be in use decades after its first release, but with none the public recognition Microsoft was once pushing for. What happened?</p><h2 id="-why-are-we-doing-this-">“Why Are We Doing This?”</h2><p>If memories of going shopping for groceries aren’t completely forgotten in this lockdown-induced haze, you might recall the industrial-looking interface of a cashier’s terminal, or a barcode scanner mounted in the aisles. And at many points on their way to the store—or your home, if we are talking about deliveries—those products were scanned using a clunky, sometimes gun-shaped mobile computer.</p><p>Chances are high that all of these devices, no matter if they were made five or fifteen years ago, are running Windows CE, a low-profile system licensed to embedded hardware manufacturers. It was developed in parallel to the desktop Windows, rather than being derived from it as the name suggests.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG" width="1678" height="1080" alt="" srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 1600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 1678w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg" width="1620" height="1080" alt="" srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 1620w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>A personal handheld computer made in 2000 and an industrial data scanner used in 2017. Windows CE powers both. <em>Dado Ruvic / Reuters; Anindito Mukherjee / Bloomberg / Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the mid-1990s, PC manufacturers licensing Windows have been barred from modifying its interface or hiding defining features like the Start menu. In contrast, Windows CE licensors are allowed to pick and choose what they need from the system and put their own user interface over it. That renders the system featureless by design.</p><p>This approach differs from the way Microsoft treated Windows CE in its early years. Most Windows CE devices had the system’s logo “emblazoned right on the plastic case,” <a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/07/20/245707/index.htm"><em>Fortune</em></a> reported in 1998, noting that “Microsoft wants consumers and businesses to think of Windows as ubiquitous—not just a figment of the PC screen.” While the system could be licensed by hardware companies only, Microsoft was running <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/windowsce">magazine ads</a> for it, promising that Windows CE-powered handheld computers were like “having the essence of your PC at your fingertips.”</p><p>To push the adoption of Windows CE, Microsoft brought their main asset into action: a Windows 95 user interface, fresh off a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/microsoft/stories/1995/debut082495.htm">reported</a> $300 million marketing campaign. While Windows CE did not sport an exact copy of the desktop’s interface, there were enough elements of it, from icons and taskbar buttons to the bezel-rich nature of each interface element, to evoke familiarity. With the initial batch of Windows CE devices, the effect was highlighted by the hardware design: so-called “Handheld PCs” were designed to look like miniaturized copies of contemporary notebook computers.</p><figure><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg" alt="The HP 320LX ad reads, “So exactly where does a palmtop end and a laptop begin?”" srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A wide screen, like this one marketed by HP, became the norm for Handheld PCs shortly after their launch. <em>HP / <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/windowsce/hp320lx">GUIdebook Gallery</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>The idea of an ultraportable computer aiming for continuity with a desktop was novel. Every other mobile computing platform of its time, from Apple’s intelligent notebook to General Magic’s collection of “virtual rooms,” was rejecting associations with desktop computing as much as they could. The idea behind Windows CE was to “prevent users from having to learn a completely new paradigm,” explained Sarah Zuberec, Microsoft’s User Research Manager, in Eric Bergman’s <em>Information Appliances and Beyond. </em>(Zuberec was researching and overseeing Microsoft’s mobile platforms from 1994 to 2005.)</p><p>Windows CE was Microsoft’s third attempt to make a dedicated mobile computing platform, and the first one which reached the market. Before that, the company had been simultaneously working on two other projects, codenamed WinPad and Pulsar. Both concepts were previewed in 1993 by Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder and then-chairman, with the work on the former beginning a year prior.</p><p>The WinPad was a part of the “Microsoft At Work” architecture which aimed to provide a unified way for office equipment to talk to each other. The main focus of the platform was to let PCs send documents to printers and faxes and get data back from them—say, a real-time printout status. But the wider concept also included portable devices and networked landline phones. “The idea is wherever there is a screen… you are to be able to call up the directory and see who’s who and get the information about them,” young Gates is seen promising in archival footage published by Microsoft’s <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/History/The-History-of-Microsoft-1993"><em>Channel 9</em></a>.</p><p>“Microsoft At Work for Handhelds,” which WinPad was called in the media, was based on the same instruction set as Windows 3.1, a 16-bit operating environment and a predecessor of modern Windows versions. Its later editions, meant for software developers who tested prospective platforms, were found alongside pre-release versions of a 32-bit Windows 95. Both systems were designed for ordinary PCs, and the WinPad device had to be a PC as well—not a trivial task at the time when notebooks were just starting to be reasonably-sized. The software project was built around a chip set made by Intel and VLSI, codenamed “Polar,” which was supposed to replicate the desktop 80386 processor in a low-power package. The joint hardware project was canned before any WinPad device came close to being shipped.</p><p>While WinPad and the At Work initiative were created for Microsoft’s business clientele, the Pulsar project was meant to have mass appeal. Gates publicized the so-called “wallet PC” concept, describing a small portable computer which would replace IDs and credit cards with messaging and organizer capabilities, in 1993. Nathan Myhrvold, founder of Microsoft’s Research division had <a href="https://mensjournal.tumblr.com/post/21029153925/nathan-myhrvold">pitched</a> him the concept in 1991. “There is no reason why you can’t just carry a single little PC about the size of a wallet—a little flat-screen device that has all your authentication credentials,” as Gates explained in his speech at the University of Washington (as quoted in <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930202&amp;slug=1683214"><em>The Seattle Times</em></a>).</p><p>Pulsar was the first attempt at implementing Gates’ vision of a wallet PC, said Harel Kodesh, Microsoft’s former VP of Consumer Appliances, in an email interview with <em>30pin</em>. “It didn’t look like Windows; it didn’t share the same API as [the 16-bit] Windows… The team had a feeling something big was happening.”</p><p>Gates described the wallet PC numerous times, referring to it as a vision of the not-so-distant future rather than a project in development. Gates’ 1995 bestseller <em>The Road Ahead</em> (which Myhrvold co-authored) laid out one of the most detailed descriptions of the wallet PC. Today, this account reads like an eerily accurate description of a modern phone, made long before even basic cell phones were commonplace. “Your wallet will link into a store’s computer to allow money to be transferred without any physical exchange at a cash register,” said Gates in a passage which would fit modern tap-to-pay systems like Apple Pay. At a later point, he imagines a wallet PC user asking the device for directions to the nearest Chinese restaurant, just like one would ask Google today.</p><p>Microsoft was not working on Pulsar by the time <em>The Road Ahead</em> hit store shelves. WinPad was no longer in development either, as both teams were reorganized in 1994. In John Murray’s <em>Inside Microsoft Windows CE, </em>Robert O’Hara, a WinPad development lead, said Gates was disappointed with the lack of shared direction. “I’ve got WinPad and Pulsar working on handheld computing, doing two completely different things. Why are we doing that?” he said, quoting Gates.</p><p>Brad Silverberg, Microsoft’s Senior VP of Personal Systems, was tasked with building a single team. “Neither [project] to me seemed like it was on a path to success, though each had some good ideas,” recalls Silverberg, famous for shipping Windows 95, in an email interview with <em>30pin</em>. To him, Pulsar was “a long way from being a product.” (Murray’s book quotes more direct criticism of the project, with Silverberg reportedly blaming the Pulsar team for not doing the market research and comparing their creation to a student project.) However, he appointed Kodesh, who oversaw Pulsar, as a leader of the merged team. “I chose Harel and a number of WinPad people left the project, which is understandable in these situations,” Silberberg says.</p><h2 id="-fortunately-the-products-sucked-">“Fortunately, the Products Sucked”</h2><p>The principal hardware design was one of the first things agreed on, as requested by Microsoft’s existing partners. “In 1994, HP and Compaq started to ask us to build a professional device,” Kodesh recalls. The former had already been making their “palmtop PC” mini-notebooks, and the new handheld PCs inherited the same clamshell design. “The form factor was considered a winner among knowledge workers who wanted a keyboard and ability to type fast.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg" alt="John Arifin, HP’s Asia-Pacific product manager for handhelds, with the 1995 lineup." srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg 1153w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>HP’s clamshell handhelds accounted for 43% of the market in 1995. <em>Martin Chan / South China Morning Post / Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>Before the team settled on a desktop interface, the new system “did not have the affinity necessary to identify itself as a Microsoft Windows product,” wrote Zuberec.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you’re a developer who mainly works with Go. You go to an event and, while chatting with some people, you decide to share with them the news that you wrote a small tool that does <em>something</em>. You claim that since you wrote it in Go, it’s fairly fast, it’s a single binary, etc. The group seems pleased with your recount and you start feeling good, but then you notice a stranger approaching from behind. A bone-chilling wind blows and you hear: “Why Go and not Rust?”</p>
<p>You start feeling less good. Well, you could answer that Go is what you know, so that’s what you used to solve your problem, but that’s probably not going to be a satisfactory answer. You were pridefully talking about how fast your tool was in the first place, and it’s obvious that the stranger is going to counter your simplistic excuse with all the great benefits that Rust brings over Go.</p>
<p>You start feeling bad. Why did you choose to learn Go in the first place? You were told that Go is fast and that it has great concurrency primitives, and now Rust comes along and everybody is saying that Rust is better in every aspect. Were they lying before or are they lying now? While there is no single language to rule them all, you know that it’s still possible to make bad choices and end up in a technological cul de sac. After all, you did choose Go over <em>that</em> other language a few years ago and you were pretty pleased with the routine of joining circles to ask “Why <em>that</em> and not Go?”</p>
<hr>
<p>While the story above is 100% the result of my imagination, it’s no secret that the Rust fandom has a few <em>overexcited</em> members who feel compelled to enlighten every lost soul about the virtues of the Crab-God. This isn’t really Rust’s fault, every successful project will have misbehaving followers, it’s inevitable. While everyone has to deal with these people, I feel that Go developers are particularly susceptible to their behavior because of how much Rust’s and Go’s <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/ivytech-mktg101-master/chapter/reading-defining-the-message/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">messaging</a> overlap.</p>
<p>Go is fast, but Rust is faster.  </p>
<p>Go has an efficient garbage collector, but Rust has static memory management.  </p>
<p>Go has great concurrency support, but Rust has provably-correct concurrency.</p>
<p>Go has interfaces, but Rust has traits and other zero-cost abstractions.</p>
<p>If you’re a Go developer you might feel a bit cheated. In contrast, Python developers are not particularly fazed by Rust. They know that Python is in many ways slow and inefficient, and they’re fine with that because they know Python’s role: make the code easy to write and offload to C when performance matters.</p>
<p>What about Go? </p>
<h2 id="go-is-very-good-for-writing-services"><a href="#go-is-very-good-for-writing-services" aria-label="go is very good for writing services permalink"></a>Go is very good for writing services</h2>
<p>Go was created at Google to solve Google problems, which mostly involves dealing with networked services. Go’s concurrency model is a good fit for server-side applications that must primarily handle multiple independent requests, rather than participate in complex result-passing schemes. This is one reason why you’re given <code>go</code> and not <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Go has great support for HTTP and related protocols and it doesn’t take long to write a satisfactory web service. In my personal projects, Go proved to be a good alternative to Node.js, especially in situations where I wanted to pin down the interfaces between different components more explicitly than you would do while writing idiomatic JavaScript.</p>
<p>On top of that, it has great tooling to diagnose concurrency and performance problems, and cross-compilation makes deploying on whichever platform a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-unapologetically-simple"><a href="#go-is-unapologetically-simple" aria-label="go is unapologetically simple permalink"></a>Go is unapologetically simple</h2>
<p>Go takes great pride in offering a limited set of features built-in the language. This makes Go easy to learn and, even more importantly, it ensures that Go projects remain understandable even when growing in size.  The creators of Go like to call it a “boring” language. While we could debate whether the language could use one or two extra things, the idea of forcing people to “do more with less” has proven to be very successful.</p>
<p>Rust can indeed be as good as Go at doing web services, or even better, but it really cannot beat Go in terms of simplicity. And it’s not just simplicity, Go is also strict about things that other languages are usually more lax about. Go doesn’t want unused variables or imports, files belonging to different packages in the same directory, etc. It even used to complain about projects saved outside of <code>GOPATH</code> (thankfully that’s not the case anymore). </p>
<p>Go also doesn’t want any “fingerprints” in the code, so it enforces a single, universal style via <code>go fmt</code>.</p>
<p>In truth, none of these things alone is particularly  impressive, but they do describe the mindset that Go wants to impose. Many don’t like it but, in my opinion, it’s a killer feature for some types of development, like enterprise software.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-great-for-enterprise-software"><a href="#go-is-great-for-enterprise-software" aria-label="go is great for enterprise software permalink"></a>Go is great for enterprise software</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned, Go was created to solve Google problems, and Google problems are definitely enterprise-scale problems. Whether this was the direct aim of the creators or just the natural result of using it at a Big Corp, Go is indubitably an amazing breath of fresh air in enterprise software development.</p>
<p>If you have experience in writing enterprise software and tried Go, you probably know what I mean. Here’s a quick summary for everyone else.</p>
<p>Enterprise development is a very weird beast compared to other kinds of development. If you’ve never done it, you might ask yourself “What the hell is even enterprise software?” I did that kind of development as a consultant for a bit, so here’s my take on the subject.</p>
<h4 id="enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale"><a href="#enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale" aria-label="enterprise software development is about scale permalink"></a>Enterprise software development is about scale</h4>
<p>Not in terms of total number of users, or amount of data. Often that’s the case too, but the defining characteristics are scale of <strong>scope</strong> and <strong>process</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Enterprise software always has a big scope.</strong> The domain can be big and wide, or narrow but stupidly complex. Sometimes it’s both. When creating software to model such domains, normal programming wisdom falls incredibly short because non-technological concerns out-weight most technological ones. </p>
<p><strong>To unravel complex domains you need a well-structured process.</strong> You need domain experts, analysts, and a mechanism that lets stakeholders gauge how much progress is being made. It’s also often the case that you, the technologist, don’t know the domain very well. Stakeholders and domain experts often won’t understand technology very well either. </p>
<p>This pushes further down technological concerns such as efficiency, <strong>and even correctness.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, the business does care about correctness, but they have a different definition for it. When you’re thinking about algorithmic correctness, they are thinking about a reconciliation back-office for the operations team they keep in a country where labor is cheap.</p>
<p>Because of the environment resulting from this general premise, a few well-known enterprise development “quirks” have emerged over time. I’ll name three relevant to my point.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There are a lot of junior developers</strong> who learn on the job how to program and most are not lucky enough to find a job that will truly teach them anything. In some places, after you’re hired, you are stationed for one week in front of PluralSight and then you’re considered ready to go.</li>
<li><strong>Software projects quickly become huge and complex for all the wrong reasons.</strong> Big projects take time to build and people (or whole teams) will come and go in the meantime. Constant refactoring is never an option so each will leave behind a lot of code written with very varying levels of quality. Multiple teams working in parallel will produce redundant code. The domain shifts over time, inevitably invalidating older assumptions and consequently causing abstractions to leak. The more sophisticated an abstraction is, the higher the risk that it will become a problem when business comes back with a serious change request.</li>
<li><strong>The toolchain is very often lousy and/or dated.</strong> This is pretty much the inevitable result of all that I described so far. Huge amounts of old code tie you down to a specific toolset, junior developers will learn the status-quo at best, and the people on top (managers and stakeholders) are extremely often not prepared for making technological decisions based on first-hand experience, the general nature of the endeavor makes them risk-averse, causing them to mainly mimic what other successful players in their space do or, more precisely, what analysts <em>claim</em> other successful players do.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale"><a href="#go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale" aria-label="go is about suppressing complexity at scale permalink"></a>Go is about suppressing complexity at scale</h4>
<p>Go makes teams more successful, partially by giving them more than what they would get with other ecosystems, and partially by taking tools away from them, to prevent common pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Go is much easier to learn than Java or C#.</strong> A faster ramp-up is generally good, but it becomes fundamental when the project is lagging behind, the deadline is approaching, and management inevitably resorts to hiring more people, hoping (in vain) to speed things up.</p>
<p><strong>The Go community regards as anti-patterns many abstractions regularly employed by Java / C#</strong>, like IoC containers, or OOP inheritance, for example. There are only two levels of visibility for variables, and the only concurrency model is CSP. It’s way harder to fall into incomprehensible pitfalls when writing in Go than it is in Java / C#. </p>
<p><strong>The Go compiler is fast.</strong> Which means that running tests is going to be faster in general, that deployments will take less time, increasing the overall productivity.</p>
<p>With Go, it’s easier as a junior developer to be more productive, and harder as a mid-level developer to introduce brittle abstractions that will cause problems down the line.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Rust is less compelling than Go for enterprise software development. That doesn’t mean that Go is perfect, or that it’s not true that Rust has some advantages over Go. Rust has many advantages over Go, but more than anything, I would say that it’s the common perception of Go that is wrong.</p>
<p>Go is not blazing-fast. Go is not super memory-efficient. Go doesn’t have the absolutely best concurrency model. </p>
<p>Go is faster than Java / C#, more memory-efficient …</p></div></div>

		<p>Today we're excited to announce that Always On repls are available to all hackers! Anyone with <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">Hacker plan</a> can choose up to 5 repls and keep them running all the time. With Always On, you can for example spin up and host an app like a Discord bot in 30 seconds:</p>

<p>As a reminder, Replit gives you most of what you need to rapidly build and ship apps in the cloud -- at lightning speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blazing fast <a href="https://repl.it/site/ide">online IDE</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/packages">Package Management</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">SSL/HTTPS</a></li>
<li>Domain <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">linking</a></li>
<li>A simple and fast <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">Database for persistence</a></li>
<li>A secure way to <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/secret-keys">store secrets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The one missing piece was a reliable way to keep your apps from going to sleep. Always On means we host your code and keep it running even if you close your Replit browser tab.</p>
<p>Prior to Always On, you might have noticed that when your repl is inactive for a little while it automatically goes to sleep. Because Replit wants to give everyone in the world the ability to code and access cloud computing, this has been a super important cost-saving mechanism and vital to the design of our infrastructure (you can read about the technical details <a href="https://blog.repl.it/killing-containers-at-scale">here</a>). As much as we'd like it to, hosting 100 million repls all the time for free just wouldn't work out. Instead we've invested in getting really fast at starting repls when they're needed and pretending like they were up the whole time. It has served us and our users well, but doesn't work in every use-case. </p>

<p>Some repls expect to be running all the time (things like cron or Discord bots), and some apps can't afford to drop some requests as the repl wakes up. As our users built increasingly ambitious apps, the need for a repl to keep running all the time has become apparent. With Always On your repl will function mostly like before, but now it won't stop running when you close the workspace.</p>
<p>Always On repls can be incredibly useful for a variety of programs and unlocks many long-requested features. The most obvious and commonly requested is for web servers to stay up. If you're tired of waiting for your webserver to wake up every time you visit, Always On is a great way to fix that. But Always On isn't just for web repls, regular old repls work too! If you have a cron job you'd like to run on a schedule, Always On makes it super easy. Discord bots, Slack bots, and other chat bots with a persistent outbound connection are another great use for Always On. And if you have a workload that's taking a long time (like say scraping a site), you can Always On the repl and go one with your life.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting a few limitations of Always On </p>
<ul>
<li>Your repl will be occasionally restarted as it is migrated between physical servers.</li>
<li>Changes your program makes to the filesystem won't persist, so we suggest you use <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Replit Database</a> rather than, for example, writing to text files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>We also want to make it clear that the use of pinging services will continue to work just as before.</p>
<p>Happy coding! If you create something interesting or novel using this technology then make sure to <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Share-your-Always-On-repls/120784">share it with us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Oh one more thing. right now replit doesn't differentiate between dev and prod apps. We're going to fix that too, and it will be epic. Stay tuned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<div>
						<p>The Bay Area has some of the most expensive property in the world. It has some of the worst local government. For years techies complained about the situation yet little was accomplished. There is a sense that things have started to change in the last year. Elon Musk moved to Austin. Keith Rabois moved to Miami.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>Beyond these higher profile cities, other holiday destinations like Lake Tahoe or Hawaii are receiving an influx of temporary and permanent migrants in search of more space and an easier ability to live with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and policy responses.</span>
	 While the recent approval and deployment of vaccines herald the end of the Covid-19 fears and restrictions that are surely driving some of the flight, the pace of relocations is increasing.</p>
<p>It would be premature to count the Bay Area out. It still offers major benefits (its temperate climate, world-class restaurants, easy access to nature, and the persisting agglomeration effects) despite the drawbacks (rent, taxes, space). But this wave of migration is an acceleration of a trend that was already happening before. There is some reason to think it will continue.</p>
<p>For one thing, anti-tech politicians in California are, if anything, ramping up their efforts to push residents associated with tech away through symbolic measures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/12/3/22151273/mark-zuckerberg-general-hospital-san-francisco-naming-vote">condemning the naming of hospitals after Mark Zuckerberg</a> and policy proposals like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-california-plan-to-chase-away-the-rich-then-keep-stalking-them-11608331448">a wealth tax</a>. But these more dramatic flare-ups are minor compared to the most harmful failure of contemporary economic policy: the restrictions on home-building driving the housing shortage in California.</p>
<p>While cities like Austin still offer cheaper rents and a lower cost of living, at least for those departing the Bay Area, familiar tensions over densification, gentrification, and transit <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/start-up-city-accelerated-growth-strains-austin-11609093013?s">are appearing</a>. Even before Covid, the types of cities most likely to attract highly skilled workers and the companies that hire them were becoming less and less accessible.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span>In addition to Austin and Miami, other cities that have been most heavily discussed include Boston, Seattle, Nashville, and Portland. All of these cities are already expensive or getting much more expensive.</span>
	 Without policy changes, these cities, like San Francisco before them, will become ever more expensive as they gain new highly-skilled residents.</p>
<h2><b>Are these cities really cheap?</b></h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-love-it-and-leave-it-11605472619">op-ed</a> for the Wall Street Journal, Palantir co-founder, venture capitalist, and newly minted Austinite Joe Lonsdale describes his reasons for picking up and leaving California. Among the benefits he sees in Texas is that, “California’s restrictive zoning laws make it nearly impossible for many essential low- and middle-income workers to live anywhere near major cities. In Texas, permissive zoning allows every member of our staff to live close to work and spend time with friends and family instead of enduring grueling commutes.”</p>
<p>While he is correct that Austin is much cheaper than California (and that zoning and other land use rules are less restrictive in Texas than in California), home prices are rising dramatically in Austin. On top of a decade of rising home prices, Austin had the <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-hottest-markets-2021-28667/">largest increases</a> in home prices of the top fifty U.S. markets in 2020 with the median list price growing by 23.6% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Austin may have more liberal housing regulations than California but much of its growth so far has mostly relied on ‘sprawl’ or horizontal growth. This model&nbsp; <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/lone-star-slowdown">will begin to break down</a> as the physical distance of new exurbs and congestion steadily increases.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[3]">[3]</sup>
	<span>California itself shows the limits of this type of development as exurbs more and more remote from the Bay Area and Los Angeles/San Diego have sprung up in the Central Valley and Inland Empire.</span>
	 It is already 38 miles from the North of the built up area to the South. Residents complain about the congestion caused by the increase in population from 675,000 in 2000 to over 1 million now. At the low density Austin is currently built at, it would take only another million or so Joe Lonsdales before outer Austin would cease to be in reasonable commuting distance of the center. The natural market remedy to these problems is to densify, through some combination of building taller and by building on smaller lots.</p>
<p>Before widespread planning,	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[4]">[4]</sup>
	<span>Prior to the early 20th century, many, but not all land use decisions were left to the market and law. Regulation of land use decisions impedes the ability of land owners and developers to respond to price signals. Rules setting out maximum allowable units per acre, minimum lot size, floor area ratio, and the like prevent densification and calcify neighborhoods.</span>
	 this was more easily accomplished, but in some areas of the country this still occurs on a large scale. Most notably, in Houston just a few hours away: A city that famously has no zoning but less famously has all sorts of important private and public land use rules. The system, in part due to changes discussed below, has led to a steady densification ripple from the center outwards. Areas that were mostly made up of small bungalows on large lots have become rowhouses, duplexes and triplexes, or narrow four-story townhomes.</p>
<p>Austin’s suburbs and exurbs do not live under such rules meaning that, like the Bay Area, it will eventually bump up against the physical limits to sprawl. If Austin wants to continue attracting Bay Area emigrants, it must ensure it can build up as well as out. This means allowing denser developments by liberalizing <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/urban-economics/do-minimum-lot-size-regulations-limit-housing-supply-texas">minimum-lot-size</a> requirements and other rules. While there has been some densification of existing neighborhoods it has occurred only after much difficulty.&nbsp; Places like East Austin, a fashionable area within a short walk of downtown, are still dominated by one and two story buildings spread out from one another on large lots. In other words, places ripe for densification. The political economy of densification has proven difficult thus far. While at a policy level the answer to the continued affordability of Austin is density, the bigger question is to figure out ways to change the rules that currently prevent densification.</p>
<h2><b>The economic implications of housing supply</b></h2>
<p>House prices can be high, or low, due to a range of factors. If house prices go up because cheaper interest rates make mortgages more affordable, this does not in itself indicate that there is a housing shortage. Similarly, in some places density is extremely high, and adding more housing is costly. Hong Kong housing is mostly expensive because building 40 storey towers is difficult, not because rules restrain what they can do with land. Therefore, we need to be careful before judging that any house price that seems ‘high’ to us is actually evidence of a shortage.</p>
<p>There is a way round this problem. Firms produce goods when they think they can sell them for more than they cost to make. Housing developers are no different. Therefore, economists tend to measure whether there is a housing shortage due to supply restrictions by looking at the ratio of the production cost of a house to the price of one.</p>
<p>As Edward Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko show in a <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.32.1.3">2018 review essay</a>, even in places like New York City and coastal California the price of housing largely reflected the cost of building until the recent past. When economic success drew new residents in, new houses were built for them. Higher productivity led to more homes and more workers, not higher home prices.</p>
<p>More recently, as existing land use regulations began to bind (and new regulations were enacted) the ratio of price to production cost has increased: construction cost explains a smaller portion of the market price and the cost of regulatory permission explains more of the sales price.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[5]">[5]</sup>
	<span>An important topic beyond the scope of this piece is research into why construction costs are so high and possible ways to lower them whether in the form of materials science research or institutional reforms.</span>
	 <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.32.1.3">Glaeser and Gyourko</a> view the ratio as a measure of the regulatory tax of building. While California has grown much more productive, it produces <a href="https://wordpressstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/wp-media/wp-content/uploads/sites/833/2019/07/CIRB-Historical-Data-1954-2019.pdf">fewer homes per year</a> than it did decades ago. Furthermore, many of the homes that are built are <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx">far from the top productivity clusters</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this policy choice to limit homebuilding, the increases in productivity are captured by landowners. More worrying than the boon to existing owners are the dynamic effects of the price: new residents are prevented from moving to more productive labor markets and growth is reduced.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[6]">[6]</sup>
	<span>Hsieh and Moretti (2019) estimate that housing restrictions had <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170388">a huge negative effect</a> on US growth between 1964 and 2009.</span>
	</p>
<p>Just a few decades ago this supply-driven housing crisis was limited to a few cities in the United States, but many other cities have followed suit. Even before years of dramatic price increases the data from 2013 used by Glaeser and Gyourko estimates that Austin had a ratio above 1. While construction costs have increased, home prices are increasing even faster leading that ratio to increase significantly. While Austin is building, the fact that the ratio is above one and rising means that it is not building enough to keep up with demand in a more clear cut way than just looking at the rising prices alone.</p>
<h2><b>Costs of reform: high and rising&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>Liberalization of rules around development may benefit society as a whole but would hurt homeowners in destination areas, many of whom bought their home for a price above its construction cost and would stand to lose out if prices fell. The higher that home prices are above the construction cost (and the more harmful the regulations likely are), the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003249?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">more difficult</a> we should expect reforms to be.

				<p>In today’s post I want to start a conversation around the tradeoffs of using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html">Typespecs</a> and <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">Dialyzer</a> use in your Elixir code.</p>

<p>Elixir is a dynamic, not a statically-typed language – and just to preemptively avoid the programming wars that might ensue, the given type system of a language is not a “good” or “bad” attribute by itself, but it will none-the-less influences the code we write.</p>

<p>For those who prefer or come to Elixir from a statically-typed language background you may be interested in learning more about <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html">Elixir Typespecs</a>, described in the documentation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elixir comes with a notation for declaring types and specifications. Elixir is a dynamically typed language, and as such, type specifications are never used by the compiler to optimize or modify code. Still, using type specifications is useful because:</p>

<ul>
<li>they provide documentation (for example, tools such as  <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc">ExDoc</a>  show type specifications in the documentation)</li>
<li>they’re used by tools such as  <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">Dialyzer</a> , that can analyze code with typespec to find type inconsistencies and possible bugs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While I have done some limited work with typespecs in my side projects, in my current client project the decree has been made we will define typespecs for all functions, both public and private, and we have dialyzer checks built into the CI to report any reported issues.</p>

<p>On the face of this requirement I do not have a problem, it is very well meaning towards building a stable codebase. Who can disagree with such a goal? The realties however of seeing it through day-to-day are more complex. First, let’s talk about how dialyzer errors can sometimes be hard to debug.</p>

<p>One recent error I got back from dialyzer was something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">:0:unknown_type
Unknown type: Widget.t/0.</code></pre></div>
<p>There was no function name, nor file name, nor line number to help me understand where this error was coming from. I was on my own. Luckily I knew the dialyzer check was clean before my I started my branch so I could at least look at my git diff for some ideas. This was not fun.</p>

<p>Another time I had a whole list of dialyzer errors reported back to me. Now if I was dealing with traditional complier errors I would work from the top of the list down, since sometimes when those first complier issues are resolved the later issues will disappear. Sadly when it comes to dialyzer errors that first error need not be what actually needs to get fixed. Many times you need to fix issues from the middle of the list first and knowing what to fix from that list is a learned art with its own dedicated learning curve.</p>

<p>Obtuse errors are bad enough but the second big issue for me is time. On a bigger project like ours it can sometime takes 10+ minutes to do a full dialyzer check the project. That long feedback loop can really slow down your day.</p>

<p>So where do we find the balance?</p>

<p>When it comes to Elixir code, my priorities of practices to enable a stable code base are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, write tests. Validate your code behaviors and assumptions. Check the happy paths and check the sad paths. Do this for every project you ever write.</li>
<li>Second, use <a href="https://github.com/rrrene/credo">credo</a>. Credo can analyze your project for Elixir style and consistency. Credo is extremely fast with helpful error messages that teach you not only how to fix something but why it should be fixed. Use this on any project that you work on for more than a few days.</li>
<li>Finally, use typespecs and dialyzer, but only for your public functions, and with a heavy leaning towards your own contexts and not the Phoenix-based modules that will be called based on dynamic behaviors like routes calling controllers. Use dialyzer for customer facing apps or anything open source.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course every project has unique needs and tradeoffs, but this is where I land in the general case.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on typespecs and dialyzer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Memgraph’s biggest new feature in the <a href="https://memgraph.com/blog/memgraph-1-3-release">v1.3 release</a> is the support for replication.</p>
<p>Although replication isn’t a new idea in the database world, it’s a great example to illustrate how often, a simple solution can be the best one.</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the concept of replication, and explain how Memgraph implements essential replication capabilities. We will discuss our approach, the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. Finally, we’ll explain in detail how do we allow you to pick what property should the replication satisfy for each replica you connect to an instance of Memgraph.</p>
<h2>A Brief Introduction to Data Replication</h2>
<p>Uninterrupted data and operational availability in production systems is critical and can be achieved in many ways.</p>
<p>In distributed systems theory, we talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP theorem</a> (Consistency, Availablity, Partition Tolerance). Out of the three, a distributed system can simultaneously satisfy at most two. Modern systems often implement a hybrid approach where some systems ensure consistency and push availability as high as possible, and others are eventually consistent but available at all times, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j4V5nAT.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Algorithms like <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a> are well known to ensure CAP properties. E.g., Raft provides consistency, partition tolerance, and availability if the majority of the cluster is healthy. It also comes with many complexities, which produces performance issues and introduces complexity not required for most known Memgraph use-cases. Mostly running analytical graph workloads on real-time data.</p>
<p>You can achieve those properties by using a much simpler concept called replication. It basically consists of replicating the data from one storage to other storages.
Because the concept is simple, achieving all three of the CAP properties at the same time is not possible. Having a combination of two of those three properties, on the other hand, is achievable.</p>
<h2>Implementing Data Replication</h2>
<p>Even though the idea of replication is simple, trying to add it to a system that has been in development for a few years, is not a trivial task. When the database was designed, the replication hadn’t been taken into consideration, so the biggest challenge was to implement the replication while minimizing the changes to the current implementation of the database.</p>
<p>First, let’s see what are the specifications of the replication we wanted to implement.</p>
<h3>What Can you do with Memgraph’s Data Replication?</h3>
<p>Before we started with the development we had worked out what do we want from our replication feature. As always, that specification evolved throughout the development, even forcing us to delay some features for future releases. We ended up with these basic key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every instance can take the role of MAIN or REPLICA, where the MAIN instance is replicating its data to its replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can register and drop a replica by specifying its
endpoint.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can have multiple replicas registered.</li>
<li>Only the storage is replicated.</li>
<li>Write queries are forbidden on replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can replicate its data in three ways or, as we call them, modes:
<ul>
<li>SYNC - The MAIN instance cannot commit a transaction until the replica has confirmed it received the same transaction.</li>
<li>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT - Same as sync but waits for some set time for confirmation. If the response timeouts, the replica is demoted to an async replica.</li>
<li>ASYNC - The MAIN instance can commit a transaction without waiting for the replica to confirm that it received the very same transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Multiple Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>As we said before, satisfying all three properties of the CAP theorem is practically impossible. But, using these modes, you can pick which of these properties you would like to have for each of your replicas. By replicating the data using the SYNC mode you achieve consistency, by using the ASYNC mode you get availability, and by using SYNC WITH TIMEOUT you try to hold the consistency until something unexpected happens forcing you to give up and accept that availability is good enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/orD51qo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Replication, no matter how simple the idea is, introduces a great number of edge cases that need to be handled in some way or another. This makes it hard to be confident in your implementation (we will never be 100% confident, which is practically a law for multithreaded and distributed applications).</p>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the basic idea behind our implementation of the replication feature and some of the interesting challenges we faced.</p>
<h2>Data Replication Implementation Basics</h2>
<p>The information necessary to implement replication is contained in transaction timestamps and so-called durability files (snapshot files and WALs).</p>
<p>Timestamps allowed us to establish a way of communication between two instances as it represents the current state of an instance. Using the timestamp, the MAIN instance can know what is the current state of the REPLICA and send the correct data for synchronization.</p>
<p>When you apply some changes to the MAIN instance, all those changes are represented by a “delta”. The concept of deltas is not new as we use them for our WAL files. Those deltas contain enough information to be sent to the replicas and be applied correctly.</p>
<p>What if a REPLICA is trailing behind the MAIN instance?</p>
<p>We simply use the durability files to “recover” the REPLICA to the state of MAIN instance. This is more or less how we implemented the replication.</p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into some specific parts!</p>
<h2>Understanding Different Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>Supporting different replication modes means supporting different ways of waiting for the response after transaction deltas were sent to the REPLICA.</p>
<p>The most straightforward mode is the <em>SYNC</em> mode as the main storage thread simply waits for the response and cannot continue until the response is received.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/09ueVPp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next in line is the <em>ASYNC</em> mode. Okay, we don’t wait for the response in the main thread but in some other thread and we’re done.</p>
<p>Well, there are multiple possibilities here. We can create a thread every time we want to replicate a transaction to the REPLICA, or we can use a single thread every time and simply queue a task that will be executed on that thread. Since creating a thread is not cheap and committing transactions is not something that happens once in 100 years we picked the latter.</p>
<p>The only problem was that we hadn’t implemented something like that.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a thread once and dispatching tasks on it isn’t something new. It’s one of the most popular patterns in multithreaded applications, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool">thread pool</a>. So, to support the <em>ASYNC</em> mode we had to add a thread pool implementation. Although we could’ve used an off-the-shelf threading library, like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly">folly</a>, we didn’t need all the functionality provided by one so we decided to write our own.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CgEK0q6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, we have the <em>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT</em> mode. Things are not so simple here. We have a main thread that wants to commit a transaction, but first, it needs to wait for the REPLICA to commit the same transaction, BUT only for some time after which it should continue replicating the transaction and any future transactions in the background. Let’s split that sentence into 3 key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for a REPLICA to commit a transaction.</li>
<li>If the timeout triggers, commit the transaction on the MAIN instance regardless and switch the REPLICA to <em>ASYNC</em> mode.</li>
<li>Don’t stop the replication of the current transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third point tells us to wait for the REPLICA’s response in a background thread so that the main thread can continue its execution even if the replication is not done.</p>
<p>The first point tells us that the main thread needs to wait for a certain time. Now our threads need to communicate somehow. Of course, we use a condition variable that can be notified by a background thread.</p>
<p>And the second point means that we need to have an additional background thread containing a timer that can also notify the main thread.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed easy, but it wasn’t. Our implementation of this looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>active = true
replication_background_thread({
  replicate...
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
timeout_thread({
  finished = false
  while (active &amp;&amp; not timeouted)
      sleep for some time
      
  finished = true
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
while (active) 
  wait
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NJkwQg9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By using only 3 threads, we already had many interesting edge cases.</p>
<p>For example, we introduced the finished flag because the timeout thread sleeps for some time while it’s active so it doesn’t register immediately that the replication thread finished. During that time another transaction can come in and try to replicate something to the same REPLICA, queue the timeout task, and after that anything is possible because the previous timeout task needs to finish first. This means that it can execute the lines after the while loop at any time which notify the main thread that the response timeouts.</p>
<p>To have things consistent we keep the sleep time at a reasonable value and before waiting for the response we wait for the previous timeout task to finish.</p>
<p>This was really important to do because we want to have the timeout time as exact as possible. If the user-specified the timeout to be 5 seconds, timing out after 10 milliseconds would probably result in angry questions on StackOverflow and/or our Forum.</p>
<p>We also wondered if using concurrency concepts like semaphore would make our lives easier in these cases while not sacrificing the performance.</p>
<h2>How Should the REPLICA Catch up to the MAIN?</h2>
<p>If the MAIN instance concludes that the REPLICA is missing some earlier transactions, the REPLICA goes into a <code>RECOVERY</code> state and remains in this state until it catches up with the MAIN instance.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways of sending the missing data to the REPLICA. The first one is by sending a snapshot, and the second one is by sending the WAL files. One important difference between those 2 files is size. Because snapshot files represent an image of the current state of the …</p></div></div>

<p><span>B</span>y the time Mudassir Azeemi wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2014, he’d tried everything he<em> </em>could think of to make it easier to type in his native language, Urdu. In 2010, the now 42-year-old Pakistani-American developed a keyboard app you could use on iOS devices; within two years, it had been downloaded over 165,000 times. But even with an Urdu-language keyboard, the characters appeared on the screen in an entirely different font.</p>



<p>“Dear Mr Tim Cook,” he wrote. “Urdu language’s beauty lies in the typeface.”</p>



<p>Spoken by nearly 170 million people in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, Urdu is written in an alphabet derived from Arabic. But while Arabic is written in a script called <em>naskh</em>, simpler and more linear in its appearance, many other people — including Iranians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Urdu-speakers in India, and Uighur-speakers in parts of China — employ an ornate style of writing that originated in 14th-century Persia called <em>nastaʿlīq</em>. When Azeemi sat down to write his letter to Cook, nastaʿlīq was almost nowhere to be found online. To communicate in Urdu, you either had to type in naskh or spell words phonetically in Latin script.</p>



<p>Azeemi, a software developer now working and living in Silicon Valley, grew up in Pakistan’s sprawling seaside city, Karachi. As a teenager during the days of dial-up, he once racked up an internet bill that cost half of his father’s monthly salary; in his early 20s, he learned to code on one of those old calculator-sized computers called palmtops. He didn’t give much thought to Urdu’s digital future until he moved to California and became a father. Watching his children learn English through songs on YouTube, he’d felt a pang of loss — the anxiety that they might never speak or appreciate Urdu the way he does. One of the earliest apps Azeemi developed, even before the keyboard, was for nursery rhymes in Urdu.</p>



<p>These early attempts at yanking Urdu on to the internet hadn’t been particularly profitable — Azeemi says he lost over $50,000 in the process. He remained determined. In 2013, Apple introduced an Urdu keyboard for iOS devices, but, much to the chagrin of Urdu users, the default font was still naskh, the Arabic font. In Azeemi’s eyes, the solution was now pretty straightforward: operating systems — Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others — had to be persuaded to adopt nastaʿlīq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His open letter, addressed to Cook and Apple’s chief design officer at the time, Jonathan Ive, described the need for a nastaʿlīq font on iOS platforms. “The only hurdle for us is to bring the typeface that truly represent[s] the language,” wrote Azeemi. “And every language, when it is written, shines when using the typeface which it truly presented in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Urdu calligraphers speak of nastaʿlīq, it is with deep reverence. In the subcontinent, it was the script that disseminated the Quran, considered the word of God. Mir Ali of Tabriz, a 14th-century Persian calligrapher known as the father of the script, is said to have developed it after a dream in which Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, instructed him to draw letters that looked like “the wings of flying geese.” Squint at an Urdu verse in nastaʿlīq, and it might very well begin to resemble a flock of birds taking flight, or a branch in bloom. Nastaʿlīq characters, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/fromconcepttocon00fush/fromconcepttocon00fush_djvu.txt">per one observation</a>, appear to “swing from the upper right to the lower left of each word as if suspended by an imaginary line.”</p>



<p>In some ways, this emphasis on the <em>form</em> of writing a language runs contrary to conventional wisdom. We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning. If you could write the same Urdu word in the Arabic naskh script, even if it looked a little different — naskh is smaller, simpler, and sans serif — wasn’t the demand for digitized nastaʿlīq just a minor typographical quibble?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nastaʿlīq, after all, is a nightmare to code. It moves right to left, like all Arabic scripts, but also slopes downward: the longer the word, the steeper the slope. The shape of each letter changes, depending on the letter that comes before and after; in a 39-letter alphabet, there are thousands of permutations. Its multifaceted nature is precisely why coders haven’t developed nastaʿlīq fonts as easily as, say, Cyrillic.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It didn’t have to be this way. As early as 1951, just four years after wresting off British rule, Pakistan — where Urdu is both the official language and played a key role in the movement for independence — set up a national printing press that could compose in both English and Urdu, a substantial investment for the young, cash-strapped country and an indication, perhaps, of Urdu’s importance for its nation-building project. But even though Monotype and Linotype, the predominant printing technology firms of the time, kept developing typefaces for the Urdu market, local publishers kept rejecting them because they just didn’t match up to the local nastaʿlīq aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the reason nastaʿlīq ran into trouble was because the technology at the time — specifically the typewriter — was built with English in mind. Subsequently, as historian Thomas S. Mullaney notes in his book, “The Chinese Typewriter,” all other languages are seen as permutations from that norm. Hebrew is English but backward. Arabic is English backward and in cursive. Russian: English with different letters. Siamese: English with too many letters. Perhaps the only major language to escape the thumb of Latin hegemony was Chinese, a script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic, and thus <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/wubi-effect">had to be imagined entirely outside the box of existing technology</a>. But nastaʿlīq, presumably not quite significant enough to send typographers back to the drawing board, remained stalled until the 1970s, its mechanical rendering nowhere close to the sweep and flourish of the handwritten script.</p>



<p>In modern-day Iran, where nastaʿlīq originated, the font changed to meet the limitations of the existing technology. Over the years, Farsi slowly developed a typographical identity that worked within the constraints of the block printing press but was stylistically different enough from the Arabic naskh to feel sufficiently “Persian.” If you pick up a newspaper in Tehran today, it looks significantly different from a paper in Karachi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn’t Urdu, and Pakistan, go down a similar typographical route as Farsi did in Iran? Stubborn fidelity to nastaʿlīq aside, one reason may be the ways in which Urdu differed from other nastaʿlīq-favoring languages. One letter, “the <em>baṛī ye</em> (ے), is particularly influential on the look of written Urdu,” writes typographer and historian Titus Nemeth in “Arabic Type-Making in the Machine Age” (2017), “and its typographic rendering is among the most challenging design questions in an Arabic font.”</p>



<p>The baṛī ye, which resembles a bent elbow, produces all sorts of mechanical obstacles with regard to kerning and the placement of dots and diacritics. Baṛī ye and letters like it posed a problem that seemed so insurmountable, in fact, that, in the 1960s — mimicking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-06-25/some-turks-reconsidering-arabic-connection-turkish-language">mission to convert Turkish script into a Latin alphabet</a> — Pakistan’s military ruler Ayub Khan proposed officially writing Urdu in Latin letters. He was met with near-instant pushback: the nastaʿlīq script, protested local religious leaders, was an essential marker of Pakistan’s Islamic identity. Without meaningful progress in the printing process, Urdu publications in Pakistan, including dailies, continued to be written by hand well into the 1980s, armies of calligraphers scribbling furiously day and night.</p>

<p><strong>Ahmed Mirza Jamil,</strong> owner of a printing business in Karachi, inherited his love for nastaʿlīq from his father, who, in his later life, took up the daunting task of writing the Quran in his own hand. He’d completed only a third of the holy book before he fell ill and died, but his sons vowed to finish his cherished project. They photographed their father’s nine handwritten chapters, then cut and pasted his letter formations to piece together — like a jigsaw puzzle — the remaining two-thirds of the Quran. It was a staggeringly elaborate labor of love that took 14 years to complete. And it sowed the seeds for a long-awaited breakthrough in Urdu typesetting.</p>



<p>In 1980, Mirza Jamil wrote out every combination of Urdu letters that he could think of — roughly 20,000 by most accounts. These combinations, known as ligatures, became the basis of a new Urdu typeface: Noori Nastaliq, a font Jamil named after his father. It solved the difficulty posed by the shape-shifting nature of nastaʿlīq: instead of representing letters, it represented entire <em>combinations</em> of letters written together. The 20,000 ligatures were by no means exhaustive, but the chances of any other combination cropping up, Mirza Jamil reckoned, were negligible. He’d been inspired to address Urdu typographical troubles after encountering a Chinese keyboard, a 48-inch contraption with up to 500 characters, on a trip to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought, if the Chinese could do it,” he told a journalist in 1996, “so could we.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the advent of Noori Nastaliq, Mirza Jamil was hailed as Pakistan’s Gutenburg and bestowed with state honors. Urdu’s path to progress, <a href="http://elite.com.pk/epl/portfolio/noori-nastaliq/revolution/">one writer wrote</a>, “will be lit with the candle of Noori Nastaliq.” Still, adoption was tentative: for a while, according to the historian Nemeth, the country’s largest national newspaper, <em>Daily Jang,</em> carried typographically composed text alongside columns that were still handwritten, hoping to convince the nastaʿlīq purists that their beloved font could be printed too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, Noori Nastaliq remained the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR: Hopsworks Feature Store provides an open ecosystem that connects to the largest number of data storage, data pipelines, and data science platforms. You can connect the Feature Store to Amazon Redshift to transform your data into features to train models and make predictions.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Amazon Redshift is a popular managed data warehouse on AWS. Companies use Redshift to store structured data for traditional data analytics. This makes Redshift a popular source of raw data for computing features for training machine learning models.</p><p>The <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks Feature Store</a> is the leading open-source feature store for machine learning. It is provided as a managed service on AWS and it includes all the tools needed to transform data in Redshift into features that will be used when training and serving ML models.</p><p>In this blog post, we show how you can configure the Redshift storage connector to ingest data, transform that data into features (feature engineering) and save the pre-computed features in the Hopsworks Feature Store.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To follow this tutorial users should have an Hopsworks Feature Store instance running on <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">https://hopsworks.ai</a>. You can register for free with no credit-card and receive 4000 USD of credits to get started.</p><p>Users should also have an existing Redshift cluster. If you don't have an existing cluster, you can create one by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/event-publishing-redshift-cluster.html">following the AWS Documentation</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 1 - Configure the Redshift Storage Connector</h2><p>The first step to be able to ingest Redshift data into the feature store is to configure a storage connector. The Redshift connector requires you to specify the following properties. Most of them are available in the properties area of your cluster in the Redshift UI.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/602234d0a3b70153cb637d34_xIgpoz4HkI5nYiN2izzA3-UYqQZS6HImR-D2_U5SdOzsXeURiaX5ihMkiKyAw6iHJK4k8ZFPMBhTEiNBe2t4X-Vq7yYgpAXO2dxw73z0rkMeELNX9TZx9uvVrhwA2seJ-BPZxAap.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Cluster identifier: The name of the cluster</li><li>Database driver: You can use the default JDBC Redshift Driver `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver` (More on this later)</li><li>Database endpoint: The endpoint for the database. Should be in the format of `[UUID].eu-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com`</li><li>Database name: The name of the database to query</li><li>Database port: The port of the cluster. Defaults to 5349</li></ul><p>There are two options available for authenticating with the Redshift cluster. The first option is to configure a username and a password. The password is stored in the secret store and made available to all the members of the project.</p><p>The second option is to configure an IAM role. With IAM roles,&nbsp;Jobs or notebooks launched on Hopsworks&nbsp; do not need to explicitly authenticate with Redshift, as the HSFS library will transparently use the IAM role to acquire a temporary credential to authenticate the specified user.&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, there are two different ways to configure an IAM role: <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/hopsworksai/aws/restrictive_permissions/#step-2-create-an-instance-profile">a per-cluster IAM role</a> or a <a href="https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/admin_guide/cloud_role_mapping.html?highlight=federated%20iam">federated IAM role (role chaining)</a>. For the per-cluster IAM role, you select an instance profile for your Hopsworks cluster when launching it in <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">hopsworks.ai</a>, and all jobs or notebooks will be run with the selected IAM role.&nbsp; For the federated IAM role, you create a head IAM role for the cluster that enables Hopsworks to assume a potentially different IAM role in each project. You can even restrict it so that only certain roles within a project (like a data owner) can assume a given role.&nbsp;</p><p>With regards to the database driver, the library to interact with Redshift *is not* included in Hopsworks - you need to upload the driver yourself. First, you need to download the library from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html#download-jdbc-driver">here</a>. Select the driver version without the AWS SDK. You then upload the driver files to the “Resources” dataset in your project, see the screenshot below. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c30543ea2172d0111008_screesnshot_01.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Upload the Redshift Driver (jar file) from your local machine to the Resources dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Then, you add the file to your notebook or job before launching it, as shown in the screenshots below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c33ec4463ca75c8c4db9_screesnshot_02.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Before starting the JupyterLab server, add the Redshift driver jar file, so that it becomes available to jobs run in the notebook.</figcaption></figure><h2>Step 2- Define an external (on-demand) Feature Group<br></h2><p>Hopsworks supports the creation of (a) cached feature groups and (b) external (on-demand) feature groups. For cached feature groups, the features are stored in Hopsworks feature store. For external feature groups, only metadata for features is stored in the feature store - not the actual feature data which is read from the external database/object-store. When the external feature group is accessed from a Spark or Python job, the feature data is read on-demand using a connector from the external store. On AWS, Hopsworks supports the creation of external feature groups from a large number of data stores, including Redshift, RDS, Snowflake, S3, and any JDBC-enabled source.&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, we will define an external feature group for a table in Redshift. External feature groups in Hopsworks support “provenance” in the Hopsworks Web UI, you can track which features are stored on which external systems and how they are computed. Additionally HSFS (the Python/Scala library used to interact with the feature store) provides the same APIs for external feature groups as for cached feature groups.</p><p>An external (on-demand) feature group can be defined as follow:</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
# We named the storage connector defined in step 1 telco_redshift_cluster
redshift_conn = fs.get_storage_connector("telco_redshift_cluster")

telco_on_dmd = fs.create_on_demand_feature_group(name="telco_redshift",
                            	version=1,
                            	query="select * from telco",
                            	description="On-demand feature group for telecom customer data",
                            	storage_connector=redshift_conn,
                            	statistics_config=True)

telco_on_dmd.save()
</p><p>When running `save()` the metadata is stored in the feature store and statistics for the data are computed and made available through the Hopsworks UI. Statistics helps data scientists in the quest of building better features from raw data.</p><h2>Step 3 -&nbsp; Engineer features and save to the Feature Store</h2><p>On-demand feature groups can be used directly as a source for creating training datasets. This is often the case if a company is migrating to Hopsworks and there are already feature engineering pipelines in production writing data to Redshift.</p><p>This flexibility provided by Hopsworks allows users to hit the ground running from day 1, without having to rewrite their pipelines to take advantage of the benefits the Hopsworks feature store provides.</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_on_dmd\
	.select(['customer_id', 'internet_service', 'phone_service', 'total_charges', 'churn'])\
</p><p>On-demand feature groups can also be joined with cached feature groups in Hopsworks to create training datasets. This <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/generated/query_vs_dataframe/">helper guide</a>&nbsp; explains in detail how the HSFS joining APIs work and how they can be used to create training datasets.<br></p><p>If, however, Redshift contains raw data that needs to be feature engineered, you can retrieve a Spark DataFrame backed by the Redshift table using the HSFS API.<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>You can then transform your `spark_df` into features using feature engineering libraries. It is also possible to retrieve the dataframe as a Pandas dataframe and perform the feature engineering steps in Python code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can then save the final dataframe containing the engineered features to the feature store as a cached feature group:<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_fg = fs.create_feature_group(name="telco_customer_features",
                            	version=1,
                            	description="Telecom customer features",
                            	online_enabled=True,
                            	time_travel_format="HUDI",
                            	primary_key=["customer_id"],
                            	statistics_config=True)
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>Storing feature groups as cached feature groups within Hopsworks provides several benefits over on-demand feature groups. First it allows users to leverage Hudi for incremental ingestion (with ACID properties, ensuring the integrity of the feature group) and time travel capabilities. As new data is ingested, new commits are tracked by Hopsworks allowing users to see what has changed over time. On each commit, statistics are computed and tracked in Hopsworks, allowing users to understand how the data has changed over time.<br></p><p>Cached feature groups can also be stored in the online feature store (`online_enabled=True`), thus enabling low latency access to the features using the online feature store API.<br></p><h2>Get started</h2><p>Get started today on Hopsworks.ai by configuring your Redshift storage connector and run <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/featurestore/aws/redshift/Redshift_pyspark.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

		<em>A most likely naive suggestion.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		A few years ago, my mother (born 1940) went to Paris on vacation with her older sister. She was a little concerned if she'd be able to navigate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro">Métro</a>, so she asked me to print out all sorts of maps in advance. I wasn't keen on another encounter with my nemesis, the printer, so I instead showed her how she could use Google Maps to get on-demand routes. Google Maps now include timetables and line information for many metropolitan subway lines around the world. I've successfully used it to find my way around London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, Sydney, and Melbourne.
	</p>
	<p>
		It even works in my backwater home-town:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/cph-metro-map.png" alt="Snapshot of Copenhagen Metro route generated by Google Maps.">
	</p>
	<p>
		It's rapidly turning into indispensable digital infrastructure, and that's beginning to trouble me.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can still get paper maps of the various rapid transit systems around the world, but for how long?

	<p>
		If you're old enough, you may remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory">phone books</a>. In the days of land lines and analogue phones, you'd look up a number and then dial it. As the internet became increasingly ubiquitous, phone directories went online as well. Paper phone books were seen as waste, and ultimately disappeared from everyday life.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can think of paper phone books as a piece of infrastructure that's now gone. I don't miss them, but it's worth reflecting on what impact their disappearing has. Today, if I need to find a phone number, Google is often the place I go. The physical infrastructure is gone, replaced by a digital infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Google, in particular, now provides important infrastructure for modern society. Not only web search, but also maps, video sharing, translation, emails, and much more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other companies offer other services that verge on being infrastructure. Facebook is more than just updates to friends and families. Many organisations, including schools and universities, coordinate activities via Facebook, and the political discourse increasingly happens there and on Twitter.
	</p>
	<p>
		We've come to rely on these 'free' services to a degree that resembles our reliance on physical infrastructure like the power grid, running water, roads, telephones, etcetera.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> coined the phrase <em>There ain't no such thing as a free lunch</em> (TANSTAAFL) in his excellent book <a href="https://amzn.to/3pWi7aM">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a>. Indeed, the digital infrastructure isn't free.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recent events have magnified some of the cost we're paying. In January, Facebook and Twitter suspended the then-president of the United States from the platforms. I've little sympathy for Donald Trump, who strikes me as an uncouth narcissist, but since I'm a Danish citizen living in Denmark, I don't think that I ought to have much of an opinion about American politics.
	</p>
	<p>
		I do think, on the other hand, that the suspension sets an uncomfortable precedent.
	</p>
	<p>
		Should we let a handful of tech billionaires control essential infrastructure? This time, the victim was someone half the world was glad to see go, but who's next? Might these companies suspend the accounts of politicians who work against them?
	</p>
	<p>
		Never in the history of the world has decision power over so many people been so concentrated. I'll remind my readers that Facebook, Twitter, Google, etcetera are in worldwide use. The decisions of a handful of majority shareholders can now affect billions of people.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're suspended from one of these platforms, you may lose your ability to participate in school activities, or from finding your way through a foreign city, or from taking part of the democratic discussion.

	</h3>
	<p>
		In this article, I mainly want to focus on the free-speech issue related mostly to Facebook and Twitter. These companies make money from ads. The longer you stay on the platform, the more ads they can show you, and they've discovered that nothing pulls you in like anger. These incentives are incredibly counter-productive for society.
	</p>
	<p>
		Users are implicitly encouraged to create or spread anger, yet few are held accountable. One reason is that you can easily create new accounts without disclosing your real-world identity. This makes it difficult to hold users accountable for their utterances.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of clear rules, users are suspended for inexplicable and arbitrary reasons. It seems that these are mostly the verdicts of algorithms, but as we've seen in the case of Donald Trump, it can also be the result of an undemocratic, but political decision.
	</p>
	<p>
		Everyone can lose their opportunities for self-expression for arbitrary reasons. This is a free-speech issue.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yes, free speech.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm well aware that Facebook and Twitter are private companies, and no-one has any <em>right</em> to an account on those platforms. That's why I started this essay by discussing how these services are turning into infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		More than a century ago, the telephone was new technology operated by private companies. I know the Danish history best, but it serves well as an example. <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTAS">KTAS</a>, one of the world's first telephone companies, was a private company. Via mergers and acquisitions, it still is, but as it grew and became the backbone of the country's electronic communications network, the government introduced legislation. For decades, it and its sister companies were regional monopolies.
	</p>
	<p>
		The government allowed the monopoly in exchange for various obligations. Even when the monopoly ended in 1996, the original monopoly companies inherited these legal obligations. For instance, every Danish citizen has the right to get a land-line installed, even if that installation by itself is a commercial loss for the company. This could be the case on certain remote islands or other rural areas. The Danish state compensates the telephone operator for this potential loss.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many other utility companies run in a similar fashion. Some are semi-public, some are private, but common to water, electricity, garbage disposal, heating, and other operators is that they are regulated by government.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a utility becomes important to the functioning of society, a sensible government steps in to regulate it to ensure the further smooth functioning of society.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think that the services offered by Google, Facebook, and Twitter are fast approaching a level of significance that ought to trigger government regulation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't say that lightly. I'm actually quite libertarian in my views, but I'm no anarcho-libertarian. I do acknowledge that a state offers essential services such as protection of property rights, a judicial system, and so on.
	</p>
	<h3 id="f4c78c79e1eb46d2941611d443f89ea1">
		Accountability <a href="#f4c78c79e1eb46d2941611d443f89ea1" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		How should we regulate social media? I think we should start by exchanging accountability for the right to post.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's take another step back for a moment. For generations, it's been possible to send a letter to the editor of a regular newspaper. If the editor deems it worthy for publication, it'll be printed in the next issue. You don't have any right to get your letter published; this happens at the discretion of the editor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why does it work that way? It works that way because the editor is accountable for what's printed in the paper. Ultimately, he or she can go to jail for what's printed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Freedom of speech is more complicated than it looks at first glance. For instance, censorship in Denmark was abolished with the 1849 constitution. This doesn't mean that you can freely say whatever you'd like; it only means that government has no right to <em>prevent</em> you from saying or writing something. You can still be prosecuted after the fact if you say or write something libellous, or if you incite violence, or if you disclose secrets that you've agreed to keep, etcetera.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is accountability. It works when the person making the utterance is known and within reach of the law.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice, particularly, that an editor-in-chief is accountable for a newspaper's contents. Why isn't Facebook or Twitter accountable for content?
	</p>
	<p>
		These companies have managed to spin a story that they're <em>platforms</em> rather than publishers. This argument might have had some legs ten years ago. When I started using Twitter in 2009, the algorithm was easy to understand: My feed showed the tweets from the accounts that I followed, in the order that they were published. This was easy to understand, and Twitter didn't, as far as I could tell, edit the feed. Since no editing took place, I find the platform argument applicable.
	</p>

		Later, the social networks began editing the feeds. No humans were directly involved, but today, some posts are amplified while others get little attention. Since this is done by 'algorithms' rather than editors, the companies have managed to convince lawmakers that they're still only platforms. Let's be real, though. Apparently, the public needs a programmer to say the following, and I'm a programmer.

	<p>
		Programmers, employees of those companies, wrote the algorithms. They experimented and tweaked those algorithms to maximise 'engagement'. Humans are continually involved in this process. Editing takes place.

	<p>
		I think it's time to stop treating social media networks as platforms, and start treating them as publishers.

		Facebook and Twitter will protest that it's practically impossible for them to 'edit' what happens on the networks. I find this argument unconvincing, since editing already takes place.

		I'd like to suggest a partial way out, though. This brings us back to regulation.

		I think that each country or jurisdiction should make it possible for users to opt in to being accountable. Users should be able to verify their accounts as real, legal persons. If they do that, their activity on the platform should be governed by the jurisdiction in which they reside, instead of by the arbitrary and ill-defined 'community guidelines' offered by the networks. You'd be accountable for your …</p></div></div>

          <p><small>Posted by Matthew Wild on February 9 2021</small></p><p><em>There is a significant difference between developing and promoting a
protocol (such as XMPP) and a product (such as Signal). Both approaches
have their advantages and disadvantages. This post details how and why
Snikket aims to strike a balance between the two.</em></p>
<h2 id="products-vs-protocols">Products vs Protocols</h2>
<p>This past weekend I gave a talk at the (virtual) FOSDEM conference about
a topic I’ve been thinking about a lot the past few years - the differences
between developing a product and developing a protocol.</p>
<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://peertube.thepacket.exchange/videos/watch/96e35d83-e70c-4a87-868b-f9cbeb48e1d0">here</a>, but there were many things I
wanted to touch upon that wouldn’t fit into the 20 minute slot. This post
will cover the same topics, but expands on some of the points I
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="previously-in-open-protocols">Previously, in open protocols…</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (once known as Jabber) for over 15
years. It is now over 20 years since XMPP’s inception, and over this
time XMPP, along with the rest of the tech industry, has seen significant
change.</p>
<p>XMPP began life in the late 1990s, as an attempt to break into the
messaging silos of that era. The names and logos may have been different,
but it was a very similar landscape to today - oversized tech companies
fighting each other for control over people who simply want to use the
internet for what it was designed, communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Email got lucky. A standard protocol managed to break down the walls of
even the final fortress of resistance, AOL. This was achieved largely
because the adoption of standard protocols by smaller providers allowed
them to form a network together that began to threaten even America’s
largest ISP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we never quite reached that point with instant messaging.
However that hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to strive for a
similar outcome even as our symbol of hope, the open email network, is
under threat today more than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite numerous projects, communities and organizations campaigning for
decades in favour of open messaging systems, the space is still
dominated by large silos. The largest the world has ever known. WhatsApp
alone has over <em>2 billion</em> users. That means a significant portion of
the world’s communications are flowing through a single company. A
company that has a simple business model - amassing data about people
and leveraging that data to help their actual customers (other
businesses) influence the beliefs, biases and behaviour of the users of
their platforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-slippery-slope">The slippery slope</h2>
<p>Despite the dizzying numbers associated with WhatsApp today, it had more
humble beginnings. Founded by two ex-Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and
Jan Koum, it began as a simple messaging app for iPhones. The server was
originally based on an <a href="https://www.process-one.net/blog/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">open-source XMPP server</a>, and
used the XMPP protocol. However the goal of WhatsApp was not openness
and federation, and they soon diverged far from standard XMPP.</p>
<p>As WhatsApp grew, early users may recall that they also began charging a
small fee for accounts ($1/year). Their reasoning was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>â€œRemember, when advertising is involved <strong>you the user</strong>
    are the product.</p>
    <p>Your data isn't even in the picture. We are simply not interested in any of it.</p>
    <p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp,
    we say â€˜Have you considered the alternative?â€™â€œ</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/why-we-don-t-sell-ads">
         <strong>WhatsApp blog post â€œWhy we don't sell adsâ€œ, June 2012</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, just two years later it was announced that WhatsApp had
been acquired by the internet’s fastest-growing advertising platform,
Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite declaring to the EU competition commission that linking an
individual’s data between WhatsApp and Facebook was not technically
feasible this is exactly what they went on to do, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/facebook-fined-eu-whatsapp-european-commission">leading to a â‚¬94
million fine</a>. Little by little, Facebook has been
loosening their privacy policies to allow them to absorb WhatsApp data
into their daily operations.</p>
<p>So when, in early 2021, the latest update to the privacy policy gave users
of the platform a clear ultimatum to allow this sharing or close their
account, many users wisely began to seek alternatives. Finally, the
moment we had been waiting for had arrived.</p>
<p>Many of us advocates of open communications seized the opportunity, and
recommendations were soon flying around for the wide range of alternative
messaging systems we’ve been building these past years. “Use XMPP!”,
“Use Matrix!”, “Use Signal!”, to name a few.</p>
<p>Despite a marked increase of signups on XMPP and Matrix servers, of
these three it was Signal that won by far the largest share of new users.
Millions of people flocked from WhatsApp and overloaded Signal’s servers,
resulting in disrupted message delivery across Signal’s service for days.</p>
<p>This service disruption was possible because, unlike XMPP and Matrix,
Signal is centralized, and all messages flow through a single set of
servers, the same model as WhatsApp.</p>
<p>XMPP and Matrix are both federated networks. Rather than a single entity
controlling the network, there are many servers to choose from, run by
many different independent providers. Even with a server down,
overloaded or closed to new users, the rest of the network continues
functioning.</p>
<p>So why did Signal receive millions of users, and XMPP/Matrix did not?</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>At this point it’s impossible not to reference <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The Ecosystem is Moving</a>,
a 2016 blog post by Signal’s founder and CEO, Moxie Marlinspike. In this
post Moxie details all the problems he sees with protocols becoming
open internet standards. In particular, that they lose their ability to
evolve, and that evolution is vital to compete in our industry’s “moving
ecosystem”.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there
       until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly
       frozen in time circa the late 1990s.</p>
    <p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">
         <strong>Signal blog post â€œThe ecosystem is movingâ€œ, May 2016</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. Far from being frozen in time, XMPP has changed significantly in the past
20 years.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/xmpp_2004_2021.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Just some of the things we have now that we didn’t have in the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption using OMEMO (based on Signalâ€™s protocol and
audited), with multi-device and offline capabilities</li>
<li>Audio/video calling (now 2nd generation, encrypted, WebRTC-compatible)</li>
<li>Mobile optimizations (bandwidth, connectivity, push notifications)</li>
<li>Full cross-device message synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these things didn’t even exist as concepts back when XMPP began.
Adding them was only possible due to XMPP’s smart design: a core
protocol, with a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">suite of extensions</a> (known as XEPs). New
extensions are added as needed, and irrelevant ones get deprecated.</p>
<p>To help keep everyone on the same page as the protocol evolves, the XMPP
Standards Foundation (XSF) annually publishes the recommended XEPs that
different classes of software (e.g. instant messaging,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/social.html">social networking</a>, or <a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html">smart devices</a>) should be
implementing. These round-ups are known as <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites.html">compliance suites</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation site <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/">Modern XMPP</a> also serves as a useful reference
guide for modern XMPP implementations (including UI/UX considerations,
which are not covered by the protocol-level documentation).</p>
<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth">The unfortunate truth</h2>
<p>The effort required in advancing the protocol <em>is</em> significant. And that’s
not even counting the implementation work. XMPP has a diverse and open
ecosystem. There is no single “XMPP client”, instead the ecosystem is
composed of… just about anyone who decides to write XMPP software. The
vast majority of this software is free/open-source, and developed by
volunteers and communities.</p>
<p>Publishing protocol updates does not magically mean the changes are
implemented in all XMPP software overnight. Some projects are more active
than others, and each contributor is an individual with their own life
and work schedule. Unfortunately this means that it’s very difficult to
evolve the protocol and keep everyone 100% in sync. Luckily XMPP’s
modular design makes it easy for some software to advance ahead of others
without having to lose backwards compatibility with the rest of the
network. If we didn’t have this feature, we would always be in a state where
half of the network is unable to communicate with the other half of the
network, or more likely we would be stuck with the initial set of
features because nobody would want to be the first ones to become
incompatible with everyone else.</p>
<p>But Moxie is right. We could move <strong>much</strong> faster if we didn’t care about
interoperability, software diversity, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And that is the approach Signal is taking.</p>
<h2 id="product-or-protocol">Product or protocol?</h2>
<p>It’s clear that there are trade-offs to be made here. Signal’s
product-led development excludes others from participating in the Signal
network. But it allows them to remain agile, and implement new features
as fast as they can write and ship code.</p>
<p>I put together some of the trade-offs into the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Building an ecosystem</th>
<th>Building a product</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus on protocol</td>
<td>Focus on implementation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly documentation</td>
<td>Mostly code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-project collaboration</td>
<td>Single project/team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building for developers</td>
<td>Building for end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slow evolution</td>
<td>Evolves as fast as you want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve diversity</td>
<td>Achieve a monoculture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robust</td>
<td>Single point of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think that Signal’s approach is laudable for the number of people that
they have helped divert from data-mining platforms, and helping to remind
people that surveillance capitalism isn’t the only way to do things.</p>
<p>They’ve built a good user-friendly product, and they have done it with
security and privacy at its heart.</p>
<p>But we have to aspire to more than this. Signal is a centralized, closed
system. That means to communicate with your contacts who use Signal, you
must also consent to their terms, their software, their US jurisdiction.
You have to be okay with their servers being hosted with large cloud
providers such as Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>But one thing the past has shown us is that things change. Technologies
evolve, business leaders come and go, motives adjust. Signal today may
be as benign as WhatsApp before its acquisition by Facebook. But …</p></div></div>

		<div>

			
<p>A few years ago, when the IETF’s Crypto Forum Research Group was deeply entrenched in debates about elliptic curves for security (which eventually culminated in RFC 7748 and RFC 8032), an IT Consultant <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/VXLC6cj2KwecsWRhp0yJXLF9jEw/">showed up on the mailing list</a> with their homemade cipher, Crystalline.</p>



<p>Mike Hamburg <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">politely</a> informed the consultant that the CFRG isn’t the right forum for proposing new symmetric ciphers, or even new modes for symmetric ciphers, and invited them to email them off-list.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the CFRG, let me just say, this was on the more patient and measured responses I’ve ever read.</p>



<p>Naturally, the author of Crystalline responded with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m somewhat disappointed in your reply, as I presumed that someone with a stated interest in ciphers would be eager to investigate anything new to pop up that didn’t have obvious holes in it. It almost sounds like you have had your soul crushed by bureaucracy over the years and have lost all passion for this field.</p><cite>Full quote available <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">here</a>. It doesn’t get much better.</cite></blockquote>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The discussion continued until Tony Arcieri dropped <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">one of the most brutal takedowns</a> of a cryptographic design in CFRG history.</p>



<blockquote><p>I think the biggest problem though is all of this has already been pointed out to you repeatedly in other forums and you completely refuse to acknowledge that your cipher fails to meet the absolute most minimum criteria for a secure cipher.</p><cite>Tony Arcieri, landing a cryptographic 360 no-scope on Crystalline.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this mic drop moment, the author of Crystalline continued to double down and insist that a symmetric cipher doesn’t need to be indistinguishable from randomness to be secure (which, to severely understate the affairs, is simply not true).</p>



<p>Normally, when a cipher fails at the indistinguishable test, it’s subtle. This is what Crystalline ciphertexts look like.</p>

<p>Modern ciphers produce something that will look like white noise, like an old TV without the cable plugged in. There should be no discernible pattern.</p>



<p>Crystalline’s author remained convinced that Crystalline’s “131072-bit keys” and claims of “information-theoretic security” were compelling enough to warrant consideration by the standards body that keeps the Internet running.</p>



<p>This was in 2015. In the year 2021, I can safely say that Crystalline adoption never really took off.</p>



<h2>Against Crackpot Crypto</h2>



<p>Instances of Crackpot Cryptography don’t always look like Crystalline. Sometimes the authors are more charismatic, or have more financial resources to bedazzle would-be <s>suckers</s>^<sup>investors</sup>. Other times, they’re less brazen and keep their designs far away from the watchful gaze of expert opinions–lest their mistakes be exposed for all to see.</p>



<p>Crackpot cryptography is considered dangerous–not because we want people to avoid encryption entirely, but because crackpot cryptography offers a false sense of security. This leads to users acting in ways they wouldn’t if they knew there was little-to-no security. Due to the strictly performative nature of these security measures, I also like to call them <strong>Security Theater</strong> (although that term is more broadly applicable in other contexts).</p>



<p>The Cryptology community has a few defense mechanisms in place to prevent the real-world adoption of crackpot cryptography. More specifically, we have pithy mottos that distill best practices in a way that usually gets the intent across. (Hey, it’s something!) Unfortunately, the rest of the security industry outside of cryptology often weaponizes these mottos to promote useless and harmful gatekeeping.</p>



<p>The best example of this is the, “Don’t roll your own crypto!” motto.</p>



<h3 id="roll-your-own">They See Me Rollin’ [My Own Crypto]</h3>



<p>Crackpots never adhere to this rule, so anyone who violates it immediately or often, with wild abandon, can be safely dismissed for kooky behavior.</p>



<p>But if taken to its literal, logical extreme, this rule mandates that nobody would ever write cryptographic code and we wouldn’t <em>have</em> cryptography libraries to begin with. So, clearly, it’s a rule meant to be sometimes broken.</p>



<p>This is why some cryptography engineers <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">soften the message a bit</a> and encourage tinkering for the sake of education. The world needs more software engineers qualified to write cryptography.</p>



<p>After all, you wouldn’t expect to hear “Don’t roll your own crypto” being levied against Jason Donenfeld (WireGuard) or Frank Denis (libsodium), despite the fact that both of those people did just that.</p>



<p>But what about <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">a high-level library that defers to libsodium for its actual crypto implementations</a>?</p>







<p>In a twist that surprises no one, lazy heuristics have a high false positive rate. In this case, the lazy heuristic is both, “What qualifies as rolling one’s own crypto?” as well as, “When is it safe to break this rule?”</p>



<p>More broadly, though, is that these knee-jerk responses are a misfiring defense mechanism intended to stop quacks from taking all the air out of the room.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always work, though. There have been a few downright absurd instances of crackpot cryptography in the past few years.</p>



<h2>Modern Examples of Crypto Crackpottery</h2>



<h3 id="craig-wright">Craig Wright’s Sartre Signature Scam</h3>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the anonymous cryptographer that invented Bitcoin. In the years since Satoshi has gone quiet, a few cranks have come out of the woodwork to claim to be the real Satoshi.</p>



<p>Craig Wright is one of the more famous Satoshi impersonators due to his <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/">Sartre Signature Scam</a>.</p>



<p>Satoshi’s earliest Bitcoin transactions are public. If you can lift the public key and signature from the transaction and then replay them in a different context as “proof” that you’re Satoshi, you can produce a proof of identity that validates without having to possess Satoshi’s private key. Then you can just wildly claim it’s a signature that validates the text of some philosopher’s prose and a lot of people will believe you.</p>



<p>With a little bit of showmanship added on, you too can convince Gavin Anderson by employing this tactic. (Or maybe not; I imagine he’s learned his lesson by now.)</p>



<h3 id="time-ai">Time AI</h3>



<p>Crown Sterling’s sponsored talk at Black Hat USA 2019 is the most vivid example of crackpot cryptography in most people’s minds.</p>



<p>Even the name “Time AI” just screams buzzword soup, so it should come as no surprise that their talk covered a lot of nonsense: “quasi-prime numbers”, “infinite wave conjugations”, “nano-scale of time”, “speed of AI oscillations”, “unified physics cosmology”, and “multi-dimensional encryption technology”.</p>



<p>Naturally, this pissed a lot of cryptographers off, and the normally even-keeled Dan Guido of Trail of Bits actually called them out on their bullshit during their presentation’s Q&amp;A section.</p>

<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I yelled at the Time AI guy. It’s ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people.

<p>For most people, the story ended with a bunch of facepalms. But Crown Sterling doubled down and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/crown_sterling_.html">published a press release claiming the ability to break 256-bit RSA keys</a>.</p>

<p>Amusingly, their attack took 50 seconds–which is a lot slower than the standard RSA factoring attacks for small key sizes.</p>



<p>(For those who are missing context: In order to be secure, RSA requires public key sizes in excess of 2048 bits. Breaking 256-bit RSA should take less than a minute on any modern PC.)</p>



<h3 id="terra-quantum">Terra Quantum</h3>



<p>Earlier this week, Bloomberg news ran a story titled, <em><a href="https://archive.md/sZ1Q5">A Swiss Company Says It Found Weakness That Imperils Encryption</a></em>. If you only read the first few paragraphs, it’s really clear that the story basically boils down to, “Swiss Company realizes there’s an entire discipline of computer science dedicated to quantum computers and the risks they pose to cryptography.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick primer on quantum computers and cryptography:</p>



<p>If a practical quantum computer is ever built, it can immediately break all of the <em>asymmetric</em> cryptography used on the Internet today: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, etc. The attack costs to break these algorithms vary, but are generally in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> range (for numbers of queries).</p>



<p>The jury is still out on whether or not quantum computers will ever be practical. Just in case, a lot of cryptographers are working on <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> (algorithms that are secure even against quantum computers).</p>



<p>Symmetric cryptography fares a lot better: The attack costs are roughly reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+N&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt N" title="\sqrt N">. This makes a 128-bit secure cipher have only a 64-bit security level, which is pretty terrible, but a 256-bit secure cipher remains at the 128-bit security level even with practical quantum computers.</p>



<p>So it’s a little strange that they open with:</p>



<blockquote><p>The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.</p><cite>From the Bloomberg article.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Uh, no.</p>



<p>Let’s do some math: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> calculations can be performed in <em>seconds</em> on modern computers. If we assume that practical quantum computers are also as fast as classical computers, it’s safe to assume this will hold true as well.</p>



<p>You can break 128-bit ciphers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time, using <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63068/attacking-aes-128-with-grovers-algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a>. You can’t break 256-bit ciphers <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">in any practical time</a>, even with the quantum computer speed-up. Most software prefers 256-bit AES over 128-bit AES for this reason.</p>



<p>What does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time look like?</p>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-02-10</span>.</p>
<p>So, you normally do <code>pip install foo</code>, or <code>composer install foo</code>, or <code>npm install foo</code>, or perhaps <code>go get foo</code>, and you never read the source code of the package you just pulled down? Well guess what, that's one (almost) sure way to blow up your project!</p>
<p>Pulling down open source code as a dependency without ever reading the code and verifying that it doesn't contain any backdoors or other malicious content has become <strong>one of the easiest ways to introduce malicious content into a code base</strong>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Fix some code and create a pull request.</li>
    <li>Fix some more code, perhaps add a new feature, and create more pull requests.</li>
    <li>Upstream "rewards" you with commit access.</li>
    <li>Keep a low profile for a while longer.</li>
    <li>Make a few mistake to check how fast "mistakes" are discovered.</li>
    <li>Create some malicious code disguised as a bug, an honest programming mistake.</li>
    <li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course you cannot validate every single line of code in every open source projects you might use, but I cannot fathom how just about everyone today are completely and blindly trusting every package out there. This is a madness and level of ignorance and naivety in the software industry not previously seen.</p>
<p>In the past many honest mistakes were made, and many systems were not originally programmed with security in mind. But as the industry has progressed and matured, many efforts have been made on many different levels and fronts to improve security, yet for some reason, with the improved access to online cooperation, this has been almost completely set back to a status even worth than in the beginning.</p>
<p>Another different subject, yet just as relevant, is how people keep making popular third party packages "hard" dependencies for their own code base. This is a mistake that very easily can blow up your code base completely, just like this for example: <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771">https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771</a></p>
<p>My point with this minor "rant" is that you need to carefully consider what packages you pull down. Don't just trust a project because it is open source. The idea that open source has many eyes watching <strong>is a myth</strong>. Nobody wants to read other peoples code, so very rarely does anyone do that.</p>
<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed bug</a>?</p>
<p>If your code base is important, make sure (as much as possible) that you can trust the code you pull down as a dependency. Read as much of the third party code as possible, create diffs when changes are made, and investigate and understand how the project handles security. If you don't, you're only asking for trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Gryphon Sql </strong>is a Windows desktop (64 bit) application that takes a CSV or Tab delimited text file and builds a SQL script from its contents. Version 1 has basic functionality that allows you to filter which rows and columns in your data file are used to build the script.</p>



<h2><a href="https://smartedit.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/apps/GryphonSQL.exe">Download here</a></h2>







<p>YOU provide the template SQL that’s used to build the script. YOU choose the columns in your file that form part of the final script. And YOU apply conditions to select the rows to use when building the script.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="425" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png?w=619" alt="Gryphon SQL Steps" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png 619w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png 619w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-300x206.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png?w=619&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>5 Steps to SQL </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The app’s functionality is explained below using a sample CSV file built on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mockaroo.com/" target="_blank">Mockaroo</a> website, containing a list of 1,000 names and email addresses, along with the gender of each person and a status field that contains values between 1 and 6.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1132" height="163" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png?w=1024" alt="Sample data file" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png 1132w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-300x43.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-1024x147.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-768x111.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1132px) 100vw, 1132px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png 1132w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-300x43.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-1024x147.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-768x111.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png?w=1024&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Sample Data File</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s assume for this example that we want to create a SQL script that populates a new table with only male entries that have a status of 6. The status field may be used to flag whether an account is active, expired, closed, on hold, etc. The purpose of the SQL script we’re generating might then be to update a table in another database with the details of closed or dormant accounts.</p>



<h2>Step 1: Load your Data File</h2>



<p>When you open Gryphon Sql you’ll see the “Load Data File” button along with a few simple file options on the start page. Here you can specify whether the first row in the data file is a header record, and you can specify the delimiter of the data file: comma, tab, or something else.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="269" height="297" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.png?w=269" alt="File Options" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.png?w=269&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>File Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once you select a file to work with that file is loaded into the UI, and you proceed automatically to Step 2. The app has been tested with a large crime dataset from Chicago containing over 250,000 records.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Choose the Important Columns in your Data file</h2>



<p>The main body of the screen for Step 2 shows you the contents of the data file you’ve selected in a common grid format. If the grid looks incorrect, if the columns are not as expected, then return to Step 1 using the <strong>Previous </strong>button and ensure you’ve selected the correct delimiter. If this doesn’t work, chances are your data file is not in the format you think it is.</p>

<p>To the left of the grid is a section where you define variables. A variable in the Gryphon Sql context is a column in your data file that you want to use to populate your script, or a column that you want to use when applying conditions to a row.</p>



<p>Based on the script we want to generate, we will need to create variables for <em>first_name, last_name</em> and <em>email</em>. We’re also going to be creating conditions based on the gender and status of each record, which means we’ll need to create variables for <em>gender </em>and <em>status </em>as well.</p>



<p>After clicking the Add button, select the data column to use when creating the variable and ensure it has a unique and easily understandable name (Column1, Column2, Column3 are not good names).</p>



<p>Finally, choose a variable type from the drop down. This last step is important, as the variable type dictates what kind of conditional you can build around it.</p>



<p>The screenshot below shows our five variables correctly defined. At this point we can move on to Step 3. If you haven’t defined any variables, you can’t proceed to Step 3 as you have nothing to work with.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Define Conditionals to Apply to These Columns</h2>



<p>On this page, we begin by creating any conditionals we want to apply when selecting the rows to use in building our SQL script. The section to the left is initially populated with a read only list of the variables you defined on the previous page. This is for easy reference only, so you know which values are available to work with.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="760" height="304" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png?w=760" alt="Step 3: Conditionals" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png 760w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png 760w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-300x120.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png?w=760&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Step 3: Conditionals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A conditional is a piece of logic that is applied to each row in your data file. If the condition passes, that row and its data are used to populate the SQL script. If it doesn’t pass, the row is excluded from the script.</p>



<p>You may or may not choose to use conditionals. In our example we want to create conditions based around the Gender and Status variables, but you may have decided to build a script based on all rows in the data file, irrespective of gender and status, in which case you should leave the conditional section blank.</p>



<p>Click the Add button to add a new conditional. A panel will appear allowing you to choose a variable to apply an IF statement to. You then select the operand to use and where necessary enter a value next to it.</p>



<p>In our example, we select <em>Status=6</em>, which will give us each record with a status of 6, and exclude all records where the status is between 1 and 5.</p>



<p>Next, add a new conditional. The first conditional is an IF statement, subsequent conditionals add to that in the form of an AND. This second conditional ensures that <em>Gender=Male</em>, giving us only Male records with a status of 6.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="316" height="491" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png?w=316" alt="Add Conditionals" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png 316w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-193x300.png 193w" sizes="(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png 316w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-193x300.png 193w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png?w=316&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Add Conditionals</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Step 4: Write SQL to Apply to Each Row</h2>



<p>Once you’ve defined your conditionals, it’s time to write your SQL template. This is the SQL that you want to build for each row that meets the conditions you’ve already defined. It may be a simple INSERT or UPDATE statement, or it may be a more complex 10 line script, duplicated for each record in the data file.</p>



<p>The template you write uses replacement strings to extract data from columns in your data file. The format of the replacement string is <em>{VariableName}</em>, with no spaces between the curly braces and the name.</p>



<p>A right click menu exists inside the editor to allow you to insert a specific variable replacement string at any point in the template script. You can use the same replacement string as many times as you wish in your script.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="678" height="208" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png?w=678" alt="Insert variables into your template script" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png 678w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-300x92.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png 678w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-300x92.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png?w=678&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Insert Variables Into Your Template Script</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You are responsible for building the correctly structured SQL around these replacement strings. For example, you need to add the single quotes around a string field and exclude them from integer fields.</p>



<p>The screenshot below shows the INSERT statement we’re building for our example. I’ve added a comment line so that we can check that the conditionals are being correctly applied in our final generated SQL, and a blank comment to break up each record’s SQL for readability.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1117" height="507" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png?w=1024" alt="SQL Template Example" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png 1117w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-300x136.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1024x465.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1117px) 100vw, 1117px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png 1117w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-300x136.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1024x465.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-768x349.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png?w=1024&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>SQL Template Example</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once your template script is ready click “Generate SQL” to create your complete script.</p>



<h2>Step 5: Generate SQL Script</h2>



<p><br>The final page shows your complete script in an edit window. There’s no syntax highlighting on this page, but you have an option to <em>“Save SQL”</em> to a file and then open that file in your favourite SQL editor or client.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="715" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png?w=752" alt="Generated SQL script in Notepad++" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png 752w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png 752w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-300x285.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png?w=752&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Generated SQL Script in Notepad++</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point you should check the contents of the generated SQL to ensure it’s correct. If you had typos in your SQL template or in your replacement variables, this is where you should spot them. Any errors can be fixed by using the Previous button and going back to make changes on previous pages.</p>





<p>A final word of caution: The generated SQL is not validated in any way. You are responsible for checking that it is syntactically correct, and that the data included in the script is the data you wish to use when updating your database. For this reason, I recommend always wrapping your script in a transaction that can be rolled back, and that you first run any script against a test database and verify the results before running it on a Production or QA database.</p>



<p>Version 1 of <strong>Gryphon Sql</strong> is light on features. I do have plans to add much more functionality over time, so check back on a regular basis. Proposed additions include:</p>



<ul><li>Building a project file to save settings per project</li><li>Multiple conditional/SQL template combinations per project</li><li>Generate scripts based on multiple input files in the same format</li><li>Allow for custom pre- and post- SQL to wrap around the generated SQL script</li><li>Full Excel file support (.xlsx)</li><li>Cross platform solution</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Criminals stole over USD 100 million in cryptocurrencies by hijacking phone numbers</p><div><p>A total of 8 criminals have been arrested on 9 February as a result of an international investigation into a series of sim swapping attacks targeting high-profile victims in the United States. These arrests follow earlier ones in Malta (1) and Belgium (1) of other members belonging to the same criminal network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacks orchestrated by this criminal gang targeted thousands of victims throughout 2020, including famous internet influencers, sport stars, musicians and their families. The criminals are believed to have stolen from them over USD 100 million in cryptocurrencies after illegally gaining access to their phones.</p>
<p>This international sweep follows a year-long investigation jointly conducted by law enforcement authorities from the United Kingdom, United States, Belgium, Malta and Canada, with international activity coordinated by Europol.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A NETWORK OF SIM HIJACKERS&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Initiated in the spring of 2020, the investigation uncovered how a network composed of a dozen criminals worked together to access the victims’ phone numbers and take control of their apps or accounts by changing the passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enabled them to steal money, cryptocurrencies and personal information, including contacts synced with online accounts. They also hijacked social media accounts to post content and send messages masquerading as the victim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of fraud is known as ‘sim swapping’ and it was identified as a key trend on the rise in the latest <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2020">Europol Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment</a>. It involves cybercriminals taking over use of a victim’s phone number by essentially deactivating their SIM and porting the allocated number over to a SIM belonging to a member of the criminal network.</p>
<p>This is typically achieved by the criminals exploiting phone service providers to do the swap on their behalf, either via a corrupt insider or using social engineering techniques.</p>
<h2>EUROPOL’S INVOLVEMENT</h2>
<p>Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) supported the case from the onset by providing the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Organised operational meetings to coordinate the international activity;</li>
<li>Facilitated the information exchange between all partners and cross-checked data sent in by the partners against Europol’s databases;</li>
<li>Supporting the action day by setting up a Virtual Command Post to provide to the investigators in the field real time and secure exchange of information and analytical support.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2>DON’T BE THE NEXT VICTIM</h2>
<p>It’s not just celebrities who are under attack. Anyone and everyone with a mobile phone can fall victim to sim swapping. Here are a few tips to help you stay one step ahead from the criminals after your personal information: &nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Keep your devices’ software up to date</li>
<li>Do not reply to suspicious emails or engage over the phone with callers that request your personal information&nbsp;</li>
<li>Limit the amount of personal data you share online&nbsp;</li>
<li>Try to use two-factor authentication for your online services, rather than having an authentication code sent over SMS</li>
<li>When possible, do not associate your phone number with sensitive online accounts</li>
</ul><p>

        <p><span><span></span></span> Allen Pike • February 8, 2021</p>

        

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

        <p><span>M</span>any marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?</p>

<p>Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her efforts as an activist as well. Shortly after getting her Ph.D., Koldewey co-founded <a href="https://www.projectseahorse.org/" target="_blank">Project Seahorse</a> to protect her study subject and the ocean habitats they live in.</p>
<p>Today, Koldewey amplifies both her science and her on-the-ground protection efforts in visionary and critical ways. She was instrumental in getting the Indian Oceanâ€™s Chagos Archipelago designated as a Marine Protected Area, which has helped degraded ecosystems revive and led to cross-disciplinary scientific breakthroughs. She helped forge the pioneering partnership <a href="https://net-works.com/" target="_blank">Net-works</a>, which supports local communities in the Philippines by helping them transform abandoned fishing nets into carpeting. Koldewey is helping make biodiversity protection a profitable business—and saving species as she goes.</p>

<p><strong>How did seahorses get you into conservation?</strong></p>
<p>I did my Ph.D. research in genetics. The whole field of molecular genetics was just starting to reveal you could identify different populations of species and where they came from by genetic markers. Amanda Vincent and I realized we could use genetics to combat the global market in seahorse trade. [More than 37 million seahorses a year are marketed for traditional medicinal use, aquariums, and souvenirs, and as a result they are threatened with extinction.] We could trace where the seahorses came from and target protection efforts to those areas. Amanda and I started Project Seahorse together, using this charismatic species to tackle big ocean issues. Sheâ€™s become the director as Iâ€™ve concentrated on other things. I stay involved and care deeply about that work.</p>
<p><strong>What did molecular genetics tell you about seahorses?</strong></p>
<p>Seahorses are rubbish at swimming, and they have home ranges. They are very immobile. You would expect that they would be highly structured, meaning that in a particular place you would find a particular species. It turns out thatâ€™s not usually the case. Even when seahorses are morphologically distinct (and donâ€™t look alike), they turn out to be closely related. Yet they are found in so many places around the globe. How can that be? They hitch a ride on whateverâ€™s passing by and move vast distances.</p>
<blockquote>When biologists and physicists&nbsp;get to put their heads together, we learn new things.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Seahorses are equally ubiquitous and threatened.</strong></p>
<p>I have a quest for solutions in the science. How do you solve problems seahorses are facing? One approach is captive breeding programs in zoos to address the aquarium trade, and there has been major progress. But of course seahorses and all the species with which they coexist have to be protected where they live. Over-harvesting of fish and incredibly destructive bottom-trawling are decimating the oceans. Industrial fishing is a huge problem. Another is the relentless pressure on coastal communities that depend on fishing for survival.</p>
<p><strong>You were instrumental in helping secure the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean as one of the largest Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the world. How can limiting human impacts on such a remote place benefit ocean health?</strong></p>
<p>Getting protection in the Indian Ocean is hard won and challenging. Some areas are so over-harvested they are ocean deserts. In 2009, a group of organizations, including mine, compiled the scientific evidence to help support protection around this archipelago, which is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory. In 2010, the Bertarelli Foundation, which has helped protect more than 2 million kilometers of marine areas over the past 20 years, helped the British government to establish what was then the worldâ€™s largest no-take MPA.</p>
<p>The Chagos Archipelago is made up of 58 tiny islands and contains the largest coral atoll on Earth. Here marine life is abundant and diverse, representing a glimpse of what our oceans should look like. Although still affected, protected areas show resilience to climate change. We have research dating back 50 years that gives us valuable insights from this unique location.</p>
<p><strong>This work is about protection, but it has also yielded new insights into how the ocean functions. How?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve known for a relatively long time that MPAs benefit reef-dwelling species, but havenâ€™t had as much information about how they influence the world of the ocean around them—migratory species, for example, and pelagic (open ocean) species. We have more than 70 scientists from disciplines including physics, genetics, and biology all working in this one place, which has yielded fantastic new insights. For example, a manta scientist watching mantas feeding noticed that they suddenly seemed to disappear. He couldnâ€™t figure it out. What made them suddenly move? The physicist who was monitoring the underwater currents at the time was able to say, â€œoh, itâ€™s the internal waves switching; takes their food right away.â€�</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that biologists and physicists donâ€™t often get to put their heads together, but when they do, we learn new things.</p>
<blockquote>Ocean health is key to supporting human life.</blockquote>
<p><strong>What about the islands themselves, the terrestrial ecosystems?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve also learned quite a lot in the Chagos Archipelago about how the terrestrial health of the islands impacts the water. Some islands are invaded with rats, which decimate native species and decrease overall biomass. Rats eat eggs and chicks. The islands that donâ€™t have rats support more seabirds. There is a more robust nutrient flow between the water and the land, thanks to the seabirds, increasing the fish biomass off these healthy islands. These islands also seem to be more resilient to coral bleaching events.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is connected. Including people and wildlife.</strong></p>
<p>That idea is at the foundation of Net-Works. As you know, plastic pollution in the oceans is a huge and growing crisis. In addition to plastic bottles everywhere, discarded fishing nets are a terrible issue. In local communities that depend on fishing for survival, the more depleted the fish in their waters, the more nets they use—and eventually abandon when they are beyond repair. Net-Works has set up a supply-chain in the Philippines in which local people are paid to collect discarded nets, bale them, and ship them out to be recycled into nylon threads that are subsequently woven into carpeting. Weâ€™ve collected enough nets thus far to wrap more than five times around the circumference of the globe. This project is not only helping to clean up the ocean, it is providing a revenue alternative to people who are unfairly exploited in the global fishing industry.</p>
<p>Net-Works has been so successful a project within the Zoological Society of London (where Heather works) that it has spun out into an independent social enterprise called <a href="https://coast4c.com/" target="_blank">Coast 4C</a>. 4C stands for â€œcommunity, commerce, conservation, climate,â€� because they are all interconnected. This model has diversified from nets to include seaweed farming in the Philippines. Carrageenan extracted from seaweed is used in products all over the world, but like so many other supply chains, this one has been unfair to local communities. Coast 4C is putting together a model in which the people who live on the water and farm the seaweed will benefit from the supply chain and increase marine protection.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry for this inevitable pun, but there seems to be a sea-change in conservation underway.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Conservation has largely depended on foundation money, grants, and funds from the government. But these are not always sustainable over time. How can we finance conservation for the long term? We are starting to see more and more initiatives that facilitate social and impact investment into conservation. We are seeing new players in the world of conservation—corporate finance people, insurance executives. Itâ€™s not just biologists and shouldnâ€™t be—everyone can be a conservationist.</p>
<p><strong>In 2018 the United Nations reported 4.6 million fishing vessels in operation, harvesting two-thirds of fishing stocks to capacity and one-third at biologically unsustainable levels. Are you worried about ocean degradation?</strong></p>
<p>To say nothing of climate change, pollution, and acidification. Ocean health is key to supporting human life. For one thing, the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces the air we breathe. More than 3 billion people rely directly on marine and coastal biodiversity to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You look at the statistics, where we are headed, and itâ€™s scary, daunting. I focus on what I can do and form collaborations with very good people. Lots of people have part of the answer but not the whole thing. Together, we can build that jigsaw puzzle and make a difference.</p>

            <p>People often use short timezone abbreviations like EST and PST to refer to timezones. If you're doing this in a computer program, you are almost certainly making a huge mistake. Let's take take a look, using the disastrously bad <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html">unix libc timezone tools</a>, which you're almost certainly using under the hood if you're writing software on Linux or OSX.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=UTC date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 12:00:00 AM UTC
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alright, this looks good. Let's try to see what time it is in New York:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Makes sense, New York is 5 hours behind UTC. It outputs the time as <code>EST</code>, so presumably we can use that as a <code>TZ</code> variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EST date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which looks like it works! But that's actually an illusion — say we tried doing this in July, instead of February:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Fri 09 Jul 2021 08:00:00 PM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we're in EDT, since it's daylight saving time. Makes sense, let's just plug that into <code>TZ</code> and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EDT date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>And hang on, <code>America/New_York</code> means <code>EDT</code>, but <code>EDT</code> gives us the time in <code>UTC</code>! What's going on here?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that <code>EDT</code> isn't a valid timezone, and <code>date</code> silently ignores the incorrect timezone variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=LOL_THIS_DOESNT_EXIST date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM LOL
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>date</code> "helpfully" ignores that the timezone is invalid, and outputs the date in UTC, but <em>using the text of the invalid timezone</em>.  Which is horrifying, but wait, why isn't EDT a valid timezone? I'm not sure what the actual reason is, but one reason that it's not correct in the general case to use the short timezone codes is that they aren't actually unique:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/Chicago date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 06:00:00 PM CST
$ TZ=Asia/Taipei date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 AM CST
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are actually two timezones that are canonically named "CST", and they're 14 hours apart! The format that <code>date</code> outputs things in causes there to be two distinct moments in time that correspond to any date outputted in the <code>Asia/Taipei</code> or <code>America/Chicago</code> timezones, and there's no way to tell which is which by looking at it — what fun!</p>

<p>There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like <code>America/New_York</code>, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.</p>

<p>I promised I’ll post stuff about low level hardware issues, and here is my second post on the subject, the first part in a series about the Intel graphics stack.</p>

<p>This post series will be a summary of about a decade of unpublished research I am trying to organize and share.
Not all of it is current, as newer hardware is harder to inspect and reverse, but I think much of the research is relevant.</p>

<p>The first post below is a quick introduction to the different components on the hardware and software side we’ll need to dive into security issues in the next post.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Processor graphics - The graphics unit that is part of the processor itself. Has had many codenames over the years, HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, Iris, Gen9, Gen11, Intel Xe and so on. Even the ‘Gen’ name has double meaning - both generation and ‘Graphics ENgine’. In UEFI code it is sometimes referet to at the IGD - Integrated Graphics Device.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The GuC - an embedded i486 core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>UEFI and OS Drivers</li>
</ul>


<p>As discussed in the introduction to the SecureBoot post, the Intel CPU has four major component groups - the CPU cores, the L3 (or LLC) cache slices, the ‘Uncore’ or ‘System Agent’ parts, all connected through a ring bus inside the die.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics process is made up from several <em>slices</em> and an <em>unslice</em> (like <em>uncore</em>) area that includes common components.
Each slice is divided into subblices and a slice common area. The subslices are made up of several Execution Units (EUs), and Texture unit and a L1 Cache/Memory. The common area includes the L3 cache and the dataport.
The limit to the number of slices is the interconnect between them and the unslice. 
There is always only a single <em>unslice</em>. In the unslice we can find the connection to the ring bus, aptly named the GT interface (GTI), the <em>Command Streamer</em> is reads commands from the system memory and into the graphics processor, the <em>fixed function pipline</em> (FF pipeline), and the thread dispatcher \&amp; spawner that lunch shader programs and GPGPU (General Purpose Comuting) programs onto the EUs. The FF pipeline deals with fixed functions such as vertice operations (called the Geometry Pipe), and other dedicated hardware such as video transcoding.</p>

<p>Different SKUs have different combinations of these. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Skylake GT2: 1 slice of 3 subslices of 8 EUs (1x3x8)</li>
  <li>Skylake GT3: 2x3x8</li>
  <li>Skylake GT4: 3x3x8</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9slice.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics engine is also connect streight to the the IOSF (Intel On Chip Fabric internal bus, see the <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/04/secure-boot.html">secureboot post</a> bus, through a controller called Gunit.  Gunit is connect to both the primary and secondary IOSF and exports functions for communicating with the graphics engine and implementing IOMMU support for graphics memory and unified memory.</p>

<p>All of this is connected to the the display IO interconnect and output to DisplayPort and HDMI outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gunit.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<h2 id="2d-graphics-pipeline">2D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The 2D graphics gengine is a standonle IP block in the <em>unslice</em> area, and has its own command streamer, registers and cache. It has 256 different operation codes, for example:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/2dops.png" alt="2D BitBlt Operations"></p>

<h2 id="3d-graphics-pipeline">3D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The fixed function pipeline in the <em>unslice</em> implements the DirectX 11 redndering pipeline stages: 
Vertex Fetch -&gt; Vertex Shader -&gt; Hull Shader -&gt; Tessellator -&gt; Domain Shader -&gt; Geometry Shader -&gt; Clipper -&gt; Windower -&gt; Z Ordering, -&gt; Pixel Shader - &gt;Pixel Output. Some of these functions are self contained, but many are implemented using by running shader programs on the EUs in the slices. EUs can send certain operations back into dedicated hardware units.</p>

<h2 id="the-execution-units-eus">The Execution Units (EUs)</h2>
<p>The EUs are in-order mulithreaded SIMD processing core. Each execution thread is dispatched has its own 128 register space and executed programs called “kernels”. All instructions are 8 channels wide, e.g. operate on 8 registers at a time (or 16 half registers). Its supports arithmetic, logical and control flow instructions on floats and ints. Registers are addressed by address.
The EU thread dispatcher implements priorities based on age, i.e. oldest is hight priority, and whether the trhead is blocked waiting on instruction fetches, register dependencies etc’. C</p>


<p>The GuC is a small embedded core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.
It is implemented in an i486DX4 CPU (also called P24C and Minute IA), altough it seems that since broadwell it has been extended to the Pentium (i586) ISA. It runs a small microkernel call μOS. 
The GuC μOS runs only kernel level tasks (even though μOS supports μApps). The firmware is written in C with not stdlib.
In the GuC we can find supporting blocks: ROM memory, 8KB L1 on core cache, 64KB/128KB/256KB (Broadwell/Skylake/CannonLake) of SRAM  memory which is used for code+data+cache and a 8KB stack. It also has power managment, DMA engine, etc’. 
Communication to the GuC is done through memory-mapped IO and bidirectional interrupts.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/guc.png" alt="GuC architecture"></p>

<p>The GuC offers a light-weight mechanism for dispatch work the host submits to the GPU. This means the GPU driver does not need to handle dispatch and job queuing, making it much faster. The <em>user mode driver (UMD)</em> can communicate with the GuC directly when required and bypass the need to context switch the main CPU into kernel mode. The <em>kernel mode driver (KMD)</em> uses the GuC as a gateway for job submission as well. This simplifies the Kernel and provides a single point where all jobs are submitted.
Communication between the UMD and the GuC is done through shared memory queues.</p>

<p><em>Why is the GuC interesting? Because I think it can communicate with the CSME, CPU and GPU and everything over the IOSF, and if it has bugs it can be used to gain very privileged access to the system and memory</em>.</p>

<h2 id="boot-rom-and-guc-firmware">Boot ROM and GuC firmware</h2>
<p>At system startup GuC is held at reset state until the UEFI firmware initializes the shared memory regtion for the GPU. Inside the shared region a special subregion call WOPCM is set aside fur GuC (and HuC) firmware. It then releases the GuC from reset and it in turn starts executing a small non-modifiable Boot ROM (16/32KB in size) that initializes the basic GuC hardware, and waits for an interupt signalling the firmware has been copied to the WOPCM region.
The GuC firmware is an opaque blob supplied by Intel as part of the GPU KMD, which copies it to the shared memory region (GGTT) and signals the Boot ROM with an interrupt. The bootrom verifies the firmware with a digital signature using a SHA256 hash + PKCSv2.1 RSA signature, and if the test passes copies it to SRAM and starts executing.</p>

<p>The GUC firmware can be extracted from the graphics driver and reversed. Screenshot of IDA open on the kabylake GuC:
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gucfirmware.png" alt="GUC firmware"></p>

<p>The GuC also attest the firmware for the video decoder unit, called <em>HuC</em>. The HuC is an HEVC/H.265 decoded implement in hardware.</p>

<h2 id="the-μos-kernel">The μOS kernel</h2>
<p>The μOS kernel runs in 32-bit protected mode, with no paging and old-style segments model (CS, DS, etc’). All code run in ring0. The OS handles HW/SW exceptions and crashes, and supplies debugging and logging services.</p>

<p>Interrupts are handled through the local APIC - I found interrupts coming from the IOMMU, power managment, display interfaces, the GPU and the CPU.</p>

<p>It runs a single process - which initializes the system and then waits for interrupts/events in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="communication-with-the-os">Communication with the OS</h2>
<p>Commands are dispatched through a ring buffer work queue. Each work item has a header followed by a command. Once a command is posted the CPU notifies the GuC using a “doorbell” interrupt.</p>

<p>The Windows kernel mode driver supports GuC debugging by setting a registry key:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
	GuCEnableUkLogging=1
    
\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
    GuCLoggingVerbositySelect=0/1/2/3 (low, medium, high, max)
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>So far we only discussed hardware. The software part of the graphics stack is divided into three levels: UEFI DXE, kernel mode and user mode.</p>

<h2 id="uefi">UEFI</h2>
<p>Traditionally VGA support was implemented with a legacy Video VBIOS as an PCI option ROM. In UEFI VBIOS was modified into a DXE driver call the <em>Graphics Output Protocol</em> (<em>GOP</em>), which support basic display for the UEFI setup menu and for the OS bootloader. The GOP is supplied by Intel to the UEFI vendor. 
The GOP supplies two basic functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing the graphics mode - resultion, pixel depth, etc’</li>
  <li>Getting the physical address of the framebuffer</li>
</ul>

<p>The Windows boot-loader uses the GOP to setup a memory mapped video framebuffer before entering VBS, and after the hypervisor and SK are loaded the access by winload is only through the framebuffer without invoking the GOP. Windows also uses the GOP for disablig blue screens.</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>On Windows, Intel supplies a fairly large graphics driver that implements both the user mode driver (UMD) and kernel mode driver (UMD). Applications using Direct3D communicate through the D3D runtime to the DXGI abstraction interface (in dxgkrnl.sys), which in turn communicated with the KMD. The KMD treats 2D Blt and 3D operations through different pipelines and dispatches the operations to the GPU.</p>

<p>The GPU driver is riddled with telemetry, but I haven’t figured out yet how much of it is sent automatically to Intel, altough crashes are sent through OCA - Online Crash Analysis.</p>

<h2 id="basic-memory-managment">Basic Memory Managment</h2>
<p>A very important job of the graphics drivers (both KMD and UMD) is memory managment (GMM). The Graphics Memory space is the virtual memory allocated to the GPU, and is translated using the system pages tables to the physical RAM. The memory contains stuff lime geometry data, textures, etc’. The GPU hardware used Graphics Page Tables (GTTs) to decode virtual addresses supplied by the software graphics memory space into …</p></section></div>

    <h2>Fractal Image Compression</h2>
    <p>14 May 2018 by <a href="https://pvigier.github.io/">pierre</a></p>
    <p>One year ago, I coded a very simple implementation of fractal image compression for a course and I made the code available on github <a href="https://github.com/pvigier/fractal-image-compression">there</a>.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the repo is quite popular. So I decided to update the code and to write an article to explain the theory and the code.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>This part is quite technical, you can skip it if you are only interested by a documentation of the code.</p>

<h2 id="contractions">Contractions</h2>

<p>Let \((E, d)\) be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space">complete metric space</a> and \(f : E \rightarrow E\) a mapping from \(E\) to \(E\).</p>

<p>We will say that \(f\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping">contraction</a> if there exists \(0 &lt; s &lt; 1\) such that:</p><p>

\[\forall x, y \in E, d(f(x), f(y)) \leq sd(x, y)\]

</p><p>From here, \(f\) will denote a contraction with contractivity factor \(s\).</p>

<p>There are two important theorems on contractions: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem">Contraction Mapping Theorem</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage_theorem">Collage Theorem</a>.</p>

<p><em>Theorem (Contraction Mapping Theorem)</em>: \(f\) has an unique fixed point \(x_0\).</p>

<p><a href="#proof1" data-toggle="collapse">Show the proof</a></p>
<div id="proof1">
<p>First, let us proof that the sequence \((u_n)\) defined by \(\left\{\begin{alignat*}{2}u_0 &amp; = x\\ u_{n+1} &amp; = f(u_n)\end{alignat*}\right.\) is convergent for all \(x \in E\).</p>

<p>For all \(m &lt; n \in \mathbb{N}\): </p><p>

$$
\begin{alignat*}{2}
d(u_m, u_n) &amp; = d(f^m(x), f^n(x)) \\
            &amp; \leq s^md(x, f^{n-m}(x)) \text{ because } f \text{ is a contraction} \\
            &amp; \leq s^m\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-m-1}{d(f^i(x), f^{i+1}(x))}\right) \text{ by the triangular inequality}  \\
            &amp; \leq s^m\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-m-1}{s^id(x, f(x))}\right) \text{ because } f \text{ is a contraction}  \\
            &amp; = s^m\left(\frac{1 - s^{n-m}}{1 - s}d(x, f(x))\right) \\
            &amp; \leq \frac{s^m}{1 - s}d(x, f(x)) \underset{m \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} 0
\end{alignat*}
$$

</p><p>So \((u_n)\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence">Cauchy sequence</a> and as \(E\) is complete, \((u_n)\) is convergent. Let \(x_0\) bet its limit.</p>

<p>Moreover, as a contraction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity">Lipschitz-continuous</a>, it is also continuous so \(f(u_n) \rightarrow f(x_0)\). Thus, if we let \(n\) tend to infinity in \(u_{n+1} = f(u_n)\), we have that \(x_0 = f(x_0)\). So \(x_0\) is a fixed point of \(f\).</p>

<p>We have shown that  \(f\) has a fixed point. Let us show by contradiction that it is unique. Let \(y_0\) be another fixed point, then:</p><p>

$$
d(x_0, y_0) = d(f(x_0), f(y_0)) \leq sd(x_0, y_0) &lt; d(x_0, y_0)
$$

</p><p>Contradiction.</p>

<hr>
</div>

<p>From here, \(x_0\) will denote the fixed point of \(f\).</p>

<p><em>Theorem (Collage Theorem)</em>: If \(d(x, f(x)) &lt; \epsilon\) then \(d(x, x_0) &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{1 - s}\).</p>

<p><a href="#proof2" data-toggle="collapse">Show the proof</a></p>

<p>We showed in the previous proof that \(d(u_m, u_n) \leq \frac{s^m}{1 - s}d(x, f(x)) = \frac{s^m}{1 - s}\epsilon\).</p>

<p>If we fix \(m\) to \(0\) then we have that \(d(x, u_n) \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1 - s}\).</p>

<p>Finally we let \(n\) tend to infinity to obtain the desired result.</p>

<hr>
</div>

<p>The second theorem tells us that if we find a contraction \(f\) such that \(f(x)\) is near to \(x\) then we are sure that the fixed point of \(f\) is also near to \(x\).</p>

<p>This result will be fundamental in the following. Indeed instead of saving an image, we will only save a contraction whose fixed point is near to the image.</p>

<h2 id="contractions-for-images">Contractions for images</h2>

<p>In this part, we will show how to build a contraction such that its fixed point is near to a given image.</p>

<p>Firstly, let us define the image set and a distance. We choose \(E = [0, 1]^{h \times w}\). \(E\) is the set of matrices with \(h\) rows, \(w\) columns and with coefficients in \([0, 1]\). Then we take \(d(x, y) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{h}{\sum_{j=1}^{w}{(x_{ij}-y_{ij})^2}}\right)^{0.5}\). \(d\) is the distance obtained from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm">Frobenius norm</a>.</p>

<p>Now, let \(x \in E\) the image we want to compress.</p>

<p>We will segment twice the image in blocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firstly, we partition the image in <em>destination</em> or <em>range</em> blocks \(R_1, ..., R_L\). These blocks are disjoint and they cover the whole image.</li>
  <li>Then, we segment the image in <em>source</em> or <em>domain</em> blocks \(D_1, ..., D_K\). These blocks are not necessarily disjoint and neither they necessarily cover the image.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, we can segment the image like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pvigier.github.io/media/img/fractal/segmentation.png" alt="Example of segmentation"></p>

<p>Then, for each range block \(R_l\), we will choose a domain block \(D_{k_l}\) and a mapping \(f_l : [0, 1]^{D_{k_l}} \rightarrow [0, 1]^{R_{l}}\).</p>

<p>Finally, we can define our function \(f\) as:</p><p>

\[f(x)_{ij} = f_l(x_{D_{k_l}})_{ij} \text{ if } (i, j) \in R_l\]

</p><p><em>Claim</em>: If all \(f_l\) are contractions then \(f\) is a contraction.</p>

<p><a href="#proof3" data-toggle="collapse">Show the proof</a></p>
<div id="proof3">
<p>Let \(x, y \in E\) and suppose that all \(f_l\) are contractions with contractivity factor \(s_l\). Then we have that:</p><p>

$$
\begin{alignat*}{2}
d(f(x), f(y))^2 &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^{h}{\sum_{j=1}^{w}{(f(x)_{ij}-f(y)_{ij})^2}} \text{ by definition of } d \\
&amp; = \sum_{l=1}^L{\sum_{(i,j) \in R_l}{(f(x)_{ij}-f(y)_{ij})^2}} \text{ because } (R_l) \text{ is a partition} \\
&amp; = \sum_{l=1}^L{\sum_{(i,j) \in R_l}{(f_l(x_{D_{k_l}})_{ij}-f_l(y_{D_{k_l}})_{ij})^2}} \text{ by definition of } f \\
&amp; = \sum_{l=1}^L{d(f_l(x_{D_{k_l}}), f_l(y_{D_{k_l}}))^2} \text{ by definition of } d \\
&amp; \leq \sum_{l=1}^L{s_l^2d(x_{D_{k_l}}, y_{D_{k_l}})^2} \text{ because the } (f_l) \text{ are contractions} \\
&amp; \leq \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}\sum_{l=1}^L{d(x_{D_{k_l}}, y_{D_{k_l}})^2} \\
&amp; = \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}\sum_{l=1}^L{\sum_{(i,j) \in R_l}{(x_{ij}-y_{ij})^2}} \text{ by definition of } d \\
&amp; = \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}\sum_{i=1}^{h}{\sum_{j=1}^{w}{(x_{ij}-y_{ij})^2}} \text{ because } (R_l) \text{ is a partition} \\
&amp; = \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}d(x, y)^2 \text{ by definition of } d \\
\end{alignat*}
$$

</p><hr>
</div>

<p>It remains one question to answer to: How to choose \(D_{k_l}\) and \(f_l\)?</p>

<p>The Collage Theorem suggests us a way to choose them: if \(x_{R_l}\) is near to \(f(x_{D_{k_l}})\) for all \(l\) then \(x\) is near to \(f(x)\) and according to the Collage Theorem \(x\) and \(x_0\) will be near too.</p>

<p>Thus, we will, independently for each \(l\), construct lots of contractions from each \(D_{k}\) to \(R_l\) and select the best one. We will show all the nitty-gritty details in the next section.</p>



<p>In each section, I will copy the interesting snippets of code but you can find the whole script <a href="https://github.com/pvigier/fractal-image-compression/blob/master/compression.py">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="segmentations">Segmentations</h2>

<p>I keep things really simple. The source blocks and the destination blocks segment the image as a grid, as on the image above.</p>

<p>The size of the blocks are powers of two as it makes things easier. The source blocks are 8 by 8 while the destination blocks are 4 by 4.</p>

<p>There exist more advanced schemes for segmentation. For instance, we can use a quadtree to segment more the areas with lots of details.</p>

<h2 id="transformations">Transformations</h2>

<p>In this section, we will show how to construct the contractions from \(D_{k}\) to \(R_l\).</p>

<p>Remember that we want to generate a mapping \(f_l\) such that \(f(x_{D_k})\) is near to \(x_{R_l}\). So, the more mappings we generate, the more likely we are to find a good one.</p>

<p>However, the quality of the compression depends on the number of bits necessary to save \(f_l\). So if we have a set of functions that is too large, the compression will be bad. There is a tradeoff to find.</p>

<p>I chose that \(f_l\) will have the following form:
\(f_l(x_{D_k}) = s \times rotate_{\theta}(flip_d(reduce(x_{D_k}))) + b\)</p>

<p>where \(reduce\) is a function to go from 8 by 8 blocks to 4 by 4 blocks, \(flip\) and \(rotate\) are affine transformations, \(s\) changes the contrast and \(b\) the brightness.</p>

<p>The function <code>reduce</code> reduces the size of an image by averaging neighborhoods:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>factor</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>zeros</span><span>((</span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>//</span> <span>factor</span><span>,</span> <span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>//</span> <span>factor</span><span>))</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]):</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>j</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]):</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function <code>rotate</code> simply rotates by the given angle the image:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ndimage</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>,</span> <span>reshape</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to preserve the shape of the image, the angle \(\theta\) will be in \(\{0^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}, 270^{\circ}\}\).</p>

<p>The function <code>flip</code> flips the image if <code>direction</code> is equal to -1 and does not if it is equal to 1:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>flip</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>img</span><span>[::</span><span>direction</span><span>,:]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The whole transformation is done by the function <code>apply_transformation</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>apply_transformation</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>,</span> <span>contrast</span><span>=</span><span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>brightness</span><span>=</span><span>0.0</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>contrast</span><span>*</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>flip</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>),</span> <span>angle</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>brightness</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We need 1 bit to remember if we flip or not and 2 bits for the angle of rotation. Moreover, if we save \(s\) and \(b\) using 8 bits each then we need only 19 bits in total to save the transformation.</p>

<p>Moreover, we should check that these functions are contractions. The proof is a bit tedious and we do not care much. Maybe I will add it in appendix later.</p>

<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>

<p>The algorithm for compression is simple. First we generate all possible affine transformations of all source blocks using the function <code>generate_all_transformed_blocks</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>generate_all_transformed_blocks</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>source_size</span><span>,</span> <span>destination_size</span><span>,</span> <span>step</span><span>):</span>
    <span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>source_size</span> <span>//</span> <span>destination_size</span>
    <span>transformed_blocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>k</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>((</span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>source_size</span><span>)</span> <span>//</span> <span>step</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>l</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>((</span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>source_size</span><span>)</span> <span>//</span> <span>step</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
            <span># Extract the source block and reduce it to the shape of a destination block
</span>            <span>S</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>[</span><span>k</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>:</span><span>k</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>+</span><span>source_size</span><span>,</span><span>l</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>:</span><span>l</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>+</span><span>source_size</span><span>],</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span>
            <span># Generate all possible transformed blocks
</span>            <span>for</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span> <span>in</span> <span>candidates</span><span>:</span>
                <span>transformed_blocks</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>((</span><span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>,</span> <span>apply_transform</span><span>(</span><span>S</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>transformed_blocks</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then for each destination block, we try all the previously generated transformed source blocks. For each we optimize the contrast and the brightness using the method <code>find_contrast_and_brightness2</code> and if the tested transformation is the best we have seen so far, we saved it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>compress</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>source_size</span><span>,</span> <span>destination_size</span><span>,</span> <span>step</span><span>):</span>

<p>Today I created a command-line tool for sending bulk SMS using Twilio.</p>

<p>The utility lets you define a mustache template and provide a CSV file with matching columns for bulk SMS sends.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>The utility requires <code>python3.7</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>python -m pip install twilio_sendsms
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>The first time you run, you will be prompted to provide your Twilio account details.</p>

<p>All configuration settings get stored in <code>~/.twilio-sendsms.config</code>. To reconfigure you can delete this file.</p>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>First, you need to define a mustache template and save to a file, e.g. example.mustache:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi {{first_name}}, this is a test SMS.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, you need to create a bulk send CSV file. The file must have a <code>mobile_number</code> column. The mobile number must be in the international format, e.g. +614XXXXXXXX. The other column names need to match the variable names used in the mustache template.</p>

<p>buld_send.csv</p>
<div><div><pre><code>"mobile_number","first_name"
"+614XXXXXXXX","Joe"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To process the batch file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sendsms --template example.mustache test.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>Before processing a bulk CVS file, it’s a good idea to sample some entries and send them to yourself first. Testing is useful to confirm the formatting and the number of segments are as expected.</p>

<p>To sample and override the mobile_number in the CSV file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sendsms --template example.mustache --sample 1 --sendto +614XXXXXXXX test.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command outputs destination mobile number, the Twilio message identifier and the SMS message sent.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+614XXXXXXXX,SM8c6335fdcffe4bb88313a16fabc9234d,Hi Joe, this is a test SMS.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Hey, if you want to come work with me at Roundforest, and try out ESM on Node.js, feel free to
find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giltayar/">LinkedIn</a> or on Twitter (@giltayar))</p>
<p>ES Modules are the future of modules in JavaScript. They already are the rule in the frontend,
but till now they couldn’t have been used in Node.js. Well, it seems that now they can.
Moreover, the Node.js community is fast at work at adding support for Node.js ESM. This includes
tools like Mocha, Ava, and even Jest (although in Jest the support is incremental). Moreover,
ESlint and TypeScript work nicely with ESM, albeit with a few gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide shows you how to use ESM in Node.js, detailing the basics, and also the gotchas
that you need to be careful with. You can find all the code in the
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">companion code repository</a>. It’s a monorepo
where each package displays a certain facet of Node.js ESM support. This post goes through
each of the packages, explaining what was done there, and what are the gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide turned out to be pretty long, so I broke it into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The basics (this document)</li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-2/">“exports” and its uses (including dual-mode libraries)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-3/">Tooling and Typescript</a></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: this guide covers <strong>Node.js ESM</strong> and does <em>not</em> cover Browser ESM.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">What do I mean by ESM in Node.js? Don’t we have that already? <a href="#what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>ESM is the standard JavaScript module system (ESM is a shorcut for
JavaScript Modules, and is also called ESM, or EcmaScript modules,
whereby “EcmaScript” is the official name for the JavaScript language).
ESM is the “newer” module system, and is supposed to be a replacement for the
regular Node.js module system, which is CommonJS (CJS for short), altought CommonJS will probaby
stil be with us for a very very long time. The module syntax is this:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b<br><span>}</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> add <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./add.js"</span></p></code></pre>
<p>(An intro to ESM is out of scope of this guide, but you can find it <em>everywhere</em> today on the
internet)</p>
<p>ESM was standardized in 2015, but it took awhile for browsers to support this,
and it took even longer for Node.js to support it
(the final stable version in Node.js was finalized only in 2020!).
If you want more information, you can see my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>. In the talk, at the end,
I discuss whether ESM is ready for work, and I say that it’s not quite there yet,
and people should start migrating to it in a year or two. Well, that year is NOW, and it’s READY,
and this guide will prepare you for that.</p>
<p>Some of you may be nodding your head and asking themselves: aren’t we already using that? Well,
if you are, then you’re transpiling your code using Babel or TypeScript, which support ESM
out of the box and transpile it to CJS. The ESM this post is talking about is <em>native</em> ESM
that is supported by Node.js without transpiling. While syntactically it is the same, there
are small differences between it and Babel/TypeScript ESM, differences which are discussed
in my Node.TLV talk above. Most importantly, native ESM in Node.js does not need transpiling,
and so doesn’t come with the baggage of problems transpiling comes with.</p>

<p>Yes. Mostly yes. All the tooling I use supports it, but there are two BIG gotchas that are probably
hard to swallow for some people, gotchas that are hard to workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jest support for ESM in Node.js is <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/ecmascript-modules">experimental</a></li>
<li>Jest experimental support does not support yet mocking modules
(regular function/object mocking is supported)</li>
<li><code>proxyquire</code> and other popular module mockers do not yet support ESM (although <code>testdouble</code>
fully support it)</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem is the lack of support for module mockers. There <em>is</em> one mocking
library that does support ESM (<code>testdouble</code>[<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble">https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble</a>]),
and we use that in this guide.</p>
<p>So can you live with this? If you can, then going all in with ESM in Node.js is now totally
possible. I’ve been using it for four months now, with zero problems. Actually, it feels
like VSCode support for ESM is much better than for CJS, so I suddenly get auto imports of modules,
and other goodies, which I didn’t get before in the CJS world.</p>

<p>This guide comes with a monorepo that has 7 directories, each directory being a package
that demonstrates the above sections of the Node.js support for ESM. You can find the monorepo
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simplest-node.js-esm-project"><a id="section-01"></a>The simplest Node.js ESM project <a href="#the-simplest-node.js-esm-project">#</a></h2>
<p>Companion code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs</a></p>
<p>This is the simplest package, and demonstrates the basics of the basics.
Let’s start by exploring <code>package.json</code>, and the new <code>exports</code> field.</p>
<h3 id="main-and-.mjs"><code>main</code> and <code>.mjs</code> <a href="#main-and-.mjs">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json</a></p>
<pre><code><span>{</span><br>  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"01-simplest-mjs"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"main"</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/main.mjs"</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The main entry point is <code>src/main.mjs</code>. Why does the file use the <code>.mjs</code> extension? Because in
Node.js ESM, the <code>.js</code> extension is reserved for CJS and <code>.mjs</code> means that this is a JS module
(in the next section, we’ll see how to change that). We’ll talk a bit more about that in the next
part.</p>
<p>Let’s continue exploring <code>main.mjs</code>.</p>
<h3 id="importing-using-extensions">Importing using extensions <a href="#importing-using-extensions">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs</a></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>bannerInColor<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./banner-in-color.mjs"</span><p><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>banner</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>bannerInColor</span><span>(</span><span>"white"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Look at the import statement that imports <code>banner-in-color</code>:
Node.js ESM <em>forces</em> you to specify the full relative path to the file, <em>including the extension</em>.
The reason they did this is to be compatible with Browser ESM (when using ESM in browsers,
you always specify the full name of the file, including the extension). So
don’t forget that extension! (You can understand more about this in my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and so Ctrl/Cmd+Clicking it won’t work,
and its built in intellisense doesn’t work on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and ignores files with that extension. In
the next section we’ll see how to deal with that, so it’s not a <em>real</em> gotcha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <code>main.mjs</code> exports the <code>banner</code> function, which will be tested in <code>test/tryout.mjs</code>. But
first, let’s explore <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code>, which contains most of the implementation of
the <code>banner()</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">Importing ESM and CJS paclages <a href="#importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>We’ve seen how we can import ESM modules. Let’s see how to import other packages:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>join<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"path"</span><br><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>We can import Node.js internal packages like <code>path</code> easily, because Node.js
exposes them as ES modules.</p>
<p>And if we had a ESM package in NPM, the same could have been used to import the ESM package.
But most of the pacakges NPM has are still CJS packages. As you can see in the second line, where
we import <code>chalk</code>, CJS packages can also be imported using <code>import</code>. But for the most part,
when importing CJS modules, you can only use “default” importing, and not “named” imports. So
while you can import named imports in a CJS file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"chalk"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> do this in a ESM file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'chalk'</span></code></pre>
<p>You can only import the default (non-named) import, and use destructuring later:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>Why is this? It’s complicated, but the gist of it is that when loading modules,
ESM does not allow <em>executing</em> a module to determine what the exports are,
and so the exports need to be determined statically.
Unfortunately, in CJS, executing a module is the only reliable way of determining
what the exports are. Node.js actually tries very hard to figure out what the named exports are
(by parsing the module using a very fast parser),
but my experience is this method doesn’t work for most packages that I’ve tried this with,
and I need to fall back to default importing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: importing a CJS module is easy, but you mostly can’t use named imports and need
to add a second line to destructure out the named imports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that in 2021, more and more packages will have ESM entry points that export
themselves as ESM with the proper named exports. But for now, you may need the additional
destructuring to use named imports from CJS pacakges.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-await">Top-level await <a href="#top-level-await">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>Continuning our exploration of <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code> we find this extraordinary line
that reads a file from the disk:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> text <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fs<span>.</span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>join</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>"text.txt"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"utf8"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>Why so extraordinary? Because of that <code>await</code>. This is an <code>await</code> that is outside an <code>async</code>
function, and is at the top level of the code. This kind of <code>await</code> is called “top-level await”
and is supported since Node.js v14. It is extraordinary because it is the only feature in Node.js
that is available <em>only</em> in ESM modules (i.e. not available in CJS). Why is that? Because
ESM is an async module system, and so supports async operations when loading the module,
while CJS is loaded synchronously and so cannot support <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Great feature, and only in ESM! 🎉🎉🎉🎉</p>
<p>But notice the use of <code>__dirname</code> in the line above. Let’s discuss that.</p>
<h3 id="__dirname"><code>__dirname</code> <a href="#__dirname">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>If you try to use <code>__dirname</code> in ESM, you will find that it is not available
(just like <code>__filename</code>). But if you need it, you can quickly determine it using these lines:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> url <span>from</span> <span>"url"</span><p><span>const</span> __dirname <span>=</span> url<span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"."</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span>meta<span>.</span>url<span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Complex? Yes. So let’s deconstruct this code to understand it.</p>
<p>First off, the expression <code>import.meta.url</code> is part of the ESM spec, and its purpose
is the same as the CJS <code>__filename</code>, except …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We started IPRally with Clojure because of my personal love story with the language. Before IPRally, I was working as a developer in Adtile, working with a globally distributed analytics pipeline. We had the code organized in Clojure microservices, and the crazy thing was that the code was easy to understand. Not only that, it was easy to modify. We had tests for the microservice functionalities, but not for the finer details. Then without changing the tests, you could fearlessly modify the solution, refactoring the code into something comprehensible. Because the language is so powerful, such high level tests can be enough.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/601403e1e7a5aaf2ddd5fc95_Screenshot%202021-01-29%20at%2014.46.39.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Data is kept in simple format. When you can understand the data, the code makes more sense too.</figcaption></figure><h2>What is this language</h2><p>Clojure is a modern reincarnation of Lisp, an ancient language already specified in 1958. In fact, the original Lisp is the second oldest high level programming language after Fortran. It was favored especially among the artificial intelligence researchers. Clojure, the Lisp of today, is often used with web development, with integrations to both Java and JavaScript ecosystems. Lately there has been some movement towards the AI&nbsp;roots too with support for <a href="https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj">Python interop</a> and Clojure data science libraries like <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>.</p><p>You don’t usually learn Clojure as your first language, nor do you accidentally end up writing Clojure in the industry. That’s why studying it tends to be a conscious choice, and that’s why the Clojurians tend to come with some seniority, and <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#top-paying-technologies">are among the highest paid programmers</a>.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/6013f8643c677af37b7e6ef6_fOxEYxyc3buKsGDE3RxXH5Ew787Gww5NzAGTWAci93BWp_1mr-ihMap5A51V0NcBHna0ENFgimFVDNj_ctH5Y4__GaGr964SfZhgZ9E99HDopawD3Xwa1IIxRg-4OAerpqIfK0Pd.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We use !&nbsp;in the end of function name if running it may have side effects. In this case, you are the machine.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Simple &gt; easy or safe</strong>‍</h2><div><p>At the end of the day, programming is mostly about building. There certainly are difficult challenges, e.g. natural language understanding, but mostly we developers focus on building systems in a maintainable way. And it’s not just about technical debt. Systems can be built in endlessly different ways, which of most eventually slow you down and cause suffering. When you compromise your solution slightly with every decision, you cannot fix it with just some refactoring. Building in a maintainable way is crucial for a product company - it eventually leads to a faster development speed and allows scaling up the organization.</p><p>Clojure opts for simplicity. As a comparison, Ruby is a language that tries to make things easy. But the Clojure way is to care less about how fast you can code, and more about minimising magic. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">Rich Hickey's classic presentation</a> on the subject comes recommended. Other languages like Java or Haskell choose safety, with type systems for data. With Clojure, the responsibility for creating safety nets is left for the developer. Advantage? In good hands, this can avoid complexity. <a href="https://labs.ig.com/lines-of-code-matter">Here</a> is an example how 441 lines of idiomatic Java become 58 lines of Clojure.</p></div><h2><strong>The right thing to do, even if it’s hard</strong></h2><p><strong>‍</strong>Aiming for simplicity makes one respect craftsmanship. No technology guarantees a simple solution. There are always more ways to create a mess than to find something elegant. Simple is hard, and we still choose simple. In the long run, a simple solution is more maintainable and safer than something more complex.&nbsp;</p><div><p>You surely can create a good solution with any moderately sensible technology. In the end of the day, developers matter more than technology or the processes, and the main advantage of Clojure comes from this. The developers who love programming and go the extra mile for learning a rare language are often pretty good ones. We met with two of the earliest IPRally team members, Juho Sepänmaa and Sebastian Björkqvist, in the Helsinki Clojure meetups. Even though Sebastian ended up working with deep learning and Python, Clojure helped once again to spot a top talent.</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/6013f86447b2bdec5422e7cd_Qz284vk1xnW6rGT320sWN40Pe80uRZw1l6u31MOAVi9jfAt3iJkoW017WmSEk9BRZ4_L0VuhSRWlN3CMCMDbTa5l1AngS-dVGJK4W-QGOTW4m6es7kbOTohGsQ8WPZYQ4-EDT3PD.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The syntax for figuring out the good startups has never been simpler.</figcaption></figure><p>We are building a tech organization with foundations in Clojure philosophy.

            <p>When it comes to sharing files, there are many SaaS options out there, but what if you need a quick and simple solution?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When I released the first version of inlets, my mind was set on solving just one problem. My team at an enterprise company needed to receive webhooks from a GitHub App in order to build a CI/CD platform we were working on. We looked to solutions like Ngrok and SSH tunnels, but both were blocked or had limits that meant they were not suitable.</p>

<p>The project did well, and then I got <a href="https://twitter.com/ntdvps/status/1143071544203186176?s=20">a message</a> from Roman Dodin who had just used inlets to transfer a large file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just transferred a 70Gb disk image from a NATed NAS to a remote NATed server with @alexellisuk’ inlets tunnels and a one-liner python web server. Check it out, works like a breeze.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Roman did not have to upload 70GB to One-Drive or Dropbox, only to download it again. He was simply able to set up an inlets exit-server and get access to the file directly, without having to wait for an initial upload and download.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to share a 5GB video recording with someone for editing, or as part of a virtual conference? Perhaps you have a number of smaller files to share with a colleague, and don’t want to clog up your Google Drive with them.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll explain how it was not as simple as I expected to share a large file over my inlets tunnel, and what I did to make it simpler. I hope you’ll also find the tool useful whether you run it directly on a cloud instance, or expose it securely over an inlets tunnel.</p>

<h2 id="not-so-simple">Not so simple</h2>

<p>So when I was having issues with my Apple Mac and Big Sur, and was asked to provide a dump of my Mac’s diagnostic information, we decided to try to use inlets to share the zip file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought: “I’ll simply use <code>inletsctl</code> to create a quick self-hosted server tunnel the inlets server, then connect my inlets client running on my laptop, and the engineer can grab the file”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I tried to use <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> - the built-in HTTP server, but it didn’t work.</p>

<p>Here’s what went wrong:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it couldn’t support the large file-size (~500MB)</li>
  <li>directory listing is turned on by default, so anyone could see the file who found the IP address</li>
  <li>there was no password protection, so anyone could download the file</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I ran an <code>nginx</code> container with Docker Desktop, and mounted my file into the container. That also didn’t work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nginx didn’t want me to serve such a large file</li>
  <li>I had to build a custom config file and rebuild the container</li>
  <li>I still didn’t have basic auth, which is trivial to set up, but lots of manual steps</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixing-the-pain">Fixing the pain</h2>

<p>Having written HTTP servers using the Golang standard library for the past 4 years, I thought I’d try making my own which could solve this pain and be built into inlets going forward.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and built the <code>inlets-pro http fileserver</code> command, and to test it, used it to share a new pre-release version of the feature with the community.</p>

<p>The main flags that solve the pain pain points above are:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>-a</span>, <span>--allow-browsing</span>      Allow directories to be browsed by clients
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means I can quickly turn on or off browsing, so I could keep a private URL, and have no need for a password.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  -p, --port int            port for server and for tunnel (default 8000)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one means we don’t have to have port clashes, even the SimpleHTTPServer supports changing the port. I also get to run two servers or more.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  -t, --token string        token or password for Basic Authentication
  -f, --token-from string   read the authentication token from a file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The token when set is the basic auth password. Basic auth over TLS is a reasonable combination for providing ad-hoc downloads.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  -w, --webroot string      select the webroot, or leave empty for the current directory
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally I wanted to give the option to easily set a webroot. It’s quite common for users to accidentally share their home directory, which includes .ssh keys and a whole host of other confidential data. This flag exists to help you be more intentional about what you share.</p>

<p>Just like with Python’s built-in HTTP server, you run <code>inlets-pro http fileserver</code> on your local computer.</p>

<p>Here’s how to turn on file-browsing and enable a password (read from a file)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http fileserver <span>\</span>
  <span>--token-file</span> <span>$HOME</span>/password.txt <span>\</span>
  <span>--webroot</span> /tmp/share <span>\</span>
  <span>--allow-browsing</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how to make it a little easier for who is accessing your tunnel by disabling the password but making sure they access a direct URL for a given file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http fileserver <span>\</span>
  <span>--webroot</span> /tmp/share <span>\</span>
  <span>--allow-browsing</span><span>=</span><span>false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, if you want to generally share files with anyone who may find them, you can do it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http fileserver <span>\</span>
  <span>--webroot</span> /tmp/share <span>\</span>
  <span>--allow-browsing</span><span>=</span><span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To put this all together you’d do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run <code>inlets-pro http fileserver</code> on your local machine</li>
  <li>Create a server on the cloud to host the <code>inlets-pro http server</code></li>
  <li>Run <code>inlets-pro http client</code> on your local machine</li>
</ul>

<p>And then share the URL with your colleagues or friends.</p>

<p>For a walk-through of everything using a custom domain and Let’s Encrypt, try this quick quest:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/cb2653a56d666871955e4ac180355168">Your quest - establish a secure tunnel with a custom domain</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>So next time you need to share a file from your local computer, or need to run a simple, but powerful HTTP server, why not try inlets-pro’s new <code>http fileserver</code> mode?</p>

<p>There is no enforced requirement to have a license to use the fileserver, but if you want to support the project and benefit from self-hosted HTTP and TCP tunnels, why not check out a personal license that you can use at home and work? <a href="https://inlets.dev/pricing/">inlets pricing</a></p>

<div><p><strong>Fetch AWS data<br></strong>Feeding AWS data into securiCAD Vanguard can be done in two ways.<br>– You can enter API keys of a read-only IAM user so that Vanguard can fetch it for you. If you want more information, see <em>Creating an IAM user</em>, <em>Setting IAM User permissions</em> and <em>Generating AWS Access Key</em> below.<br>– You can download a script, enter your keys, and let it fetch your configuration for you. It will then store the configuration as a json file which you then upload into vanguard. If you want more information see below.</p><p><strong>Amazon Inspector<br></strong>By including data from Amazon Inspector, securiCAD Vanguard can help you prioritize existing vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector data can be included in the simulation by either checking the box for Amazon Inspector when simulating from an IAM User or by running the CLI Script locally. securiCAD Vanguard will automatically fetch scans from the last 30 days and pick the lastest scan and gather CVE and Network Reachability data.</p><p><strong>Configure Simulations<br></strong></p><p>Once you have a model of your environment you may supply some additional information.<br>– Threat profile. Are you worried about criminals, nation state hackers or bored teenagers? Which threat profile you choose will affect the simulation results.<br>– High value assets. Which components in your environment contain the sensitive data or must not be compromised?<br>If you want to know more about these configuration options, please see <em>Assets &amp; Threat Profile</em> under <em>How it works</em> further down.</p><p><strong>Simulate<br></strong>Clicking ”Simulate” will start the attack simulation of the model generated from the AWS data and the selected scenario configuration.<br>Simulations are computationally heavy and may take anywhere from seconds to minutes depending on size of the generated model.<br>Once the simulation is done, the model and results can be inspected by selecting “Critical Path”, “Report” or “Model viewer”. See below for details on each of these.</p></div>

A desired outcome can for example be to gain administrative access to a given EC2 instance which e.g. is represented by the HighPrivilegeAccess attack step and that will be highlighted in blue in the Critical Path viewer.</p><p>The term “path” may be a bit misleading as attack steps may require multiple preconditions to be satisfied. This is for example access via known credentials to a networked service which will require both the ability to connect to the service over the network as well as access to the login credentials.

Ryan is based in LA. I’m based in London. We work on the internet. </p><p>There has been a lot of “micro fund” chat on the internet: <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/24/how-rolling-funds-could-rock-vc/">The rise of rolling funds</a>, <a href="https://thecuriousinvestor.substack.com/p/rolling-funds-and-the-rise-of-the">the rise of Micro LPs</a>, <a href="https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists">The Rise of the Solo Capitalists</a>…</p><p>But little has been shared about how funds like ours operate, and how we aim to: </p><ul role="list"><li>Be the highest helpfulness to check-size ratio investor to our portfolio founders. One of our portfolio founders Harry Hurst tweeted about the concept <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhurst/status/1280165358255538179">here</a>. </li><li>Invest in the best early-stage deals partnering with founders early and driving returns </li><li>Be the best possible fund manager to our LPs: trusted, communicative and high-performing</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Jeff Lawson, the founder and CEO of Twilio, said this about strategy on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VHi9azzFenfH4R9SlBHqT?si=nsqv1LKhRa64c5vr1Lqs4Q">Bessemer Venture Partners Cloud Giants Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>I often say that strategy is a dirty word in business; it should be struck. Any time you find yourself talking about strategy, you’re probably off-course, actually. There’s only one business strategy: serve your customers.</blockquote><p>I agree with that. In venture, I think there’s only one core strategy: serving founders in a differentiated way. We’ve implemented workflows made up of tools, automations and habits to optimize our limited time to create leverage to serve founders.</p><p>Let’s break this down.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Spark</h3><p>Investors spend a lot of time in their inbox. 😅 </p><p>Here’s what makes Spark the best email tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Shared drafts:</strong> We use each other as a second pair of eyes to review email drafts including offers to invest in companies, deal-flow sharing with other investors and diligence follow-ups. Spark has a collaborative real-time editor that speeds up making edits before sending a draft. </li><li><strong>Spark templates:</strong> We use Spark templates to quickly share details about portfolio companies with other investors when helping founders with their fundraise.</li><li><strong>In-email private chat:</strong> We use this to make quick decisions about the email we receive. This includes cold email, deal-flow from other investors and admin/scheduling.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-_7ba6e6a7-3dcf-2fca-e88d-37c75a60536c-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600dfe86a1d3df2e88f92e31_spark-chat.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Airtable</h3><p>Airtable is the central storage for all information on deal flow, investments, and people in our network.</p><p>Here’s what makes Airtable the best tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Flexible:</strong> It’s flexible enough for us to store anything. We store a lot. </li><li><strong>Relational:</strong> You’ve probably heard that investors are in the relationship business. Relational databases like Airtable aren’t just about storing data, they store relationships between data. This helps us see links between the companies, deals, founders, investors, funds, and more in the WF universe. </li><li><strong>Integration friendly:</strong> It integrates with other tools to make all types of workflows that power the fund.</li></ul><p>Our Airtable “base” includes three primary tables:</p><p><strong>Companies</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We manage our Pipeline through an “Active Pipeline” view which filters companies we are meeting, diligencing or going to pass on. We also have a Missed view, a Tracking view, a Markups view and more to help us sort through companies. </li><li>We automatically capture pipeline entry and exit dates to track how fast we’re responding to founders. We try to get back to founders with a 7 day “SLA”. </li><li>We also record who introduced us to every deal sourced through an introduction. This links to our People table enriching our CRM. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>People</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>This includes founders, investors and others who have introduced us to companies. The table is designed to surface the context of our relationship: i.e for investors, it would surface which deals we’ve co-invested in, which deals they introduced us to, etc. </li><li>We have a “Warm Angel and Small Fund” view we use to share deals with angels + small funds we’re collaborating most with. </li><li>We also have a “Top Introducers” view that filters top introducers based on the # of deals + portfolio companies they’ve introduced us to.</li></ul><p><strong>VC Firms</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We use this table to capture who is investing at VC firms (linked of course to the People table), and what stages, categories, check sizes they invest in, and if they lead rounds. </li><li>Like our People table, we have a “Warm VC Firms” table we use to share deals with the firms that are most collaborative. It’s also helpful for identifying firms that might be best suited for a particular company based on their stage and market focus. </li><li>What makes this table especially useful for deal-sharing is the subjective context we capture in notes and often share with founders before making introductions. Here’s what a note would look like “Coatue is one of the most data-driven firms and Mazzeo’s one of the most energetic, product-minded investors I know.” Yes, that is a real example.</li></ul><p>🎁 Here’s a digital goodie: <a href="https://airtable.com/shr5i9tJSUl7ob7CY/tblbr0WwfLMZ1a9Mc/viwZ1sYZ9ripf5Ft4?blocks=hide">Template from our Airtable</a></p><figure id="w-node-_8d35af31-6898-a193-fc30-0a3d187f3df2-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600ee65b3b6b23278218888b_Screenshot%202021-01-25%20at%2015.40.25.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Zapier</h3><p>We automate as much as possible not just to save time, but also to not miss any steps in our processes. We want to be working on the right things, the right way. &nbsp;</p><p>Zaps we have running right now:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Deal channel creation zap: </strong>We have a Zap that automatically creates a deal channel in Slack for every deal we’re meeting from Airtable. More on that below. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a></li><li><strong>7-day SLA zap:</strong> We have a Zap that sets up a reminder to follow up 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline. This helps us ensure that we get back to every founder in a reasonable time. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a> (last 2 steps in template)</li><li><strong>Tracking zap:</strong> We have another Zap to follow up on companies we’re tracking. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/71703611e82231e90d81e13e60cd722dc5aad259">Template here</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Slack</h3><p>Slack works well for our working style at Weekend Fund. Here’s how we use it for deals:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Our deal creation Zap (as mentioned above) automatically creates a Slack channel for every company we’re meeting</li><li>We consolidate materials/context in the channel before every pitch call </li><li>We share questions for the founder in the channel before every pitch to ensure we’re well prepared </li><li>Debrief + decide next steps immediately after call </li><li>The 7 day SLA Zap goes off in the channel 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline </li><li>We close the channel only after we close the investment or send the pass email + “close the loop” email updating the person who introduced us to the deal</li></ol><p>In addition to deal channels, we have a few more to organize our communications:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>#deal-outbound:</strong> Vedika is using this channel to build a habit of outbound deal sourcing starting with 1x deal a day </li><li><strong>#experiments:</strong> As early stage becomes even more competitive, it feels even more important for us to run experiments. We’ve run experiments like Weekend Build, Fundraise From Home, and are working on our next one. This is the channel we use for experiments related chat. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>#shower-thoughts:</strong> This is a creative safe space where we discuss “What if we tried this?” ideas.</li></ul><p>At the time of this post, we have 25 Slack channels open. This might sound silly for a two-person team, but we’ve found this organization helpful in our communications. Our slack history is a searchable artifact for the years to come.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Vimcal</h3><p>The newest tool in our stack is Vimcal, the calendar app we use for scheduling. Here’s why we use it:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Timezone juggling: </strong>As a distributed team jumping on calls with founders around the world, we do a lot of scheduling across timezones. Vimcal is the best tool we’ve found for this.</li><li><strong>Efficient, but still personal:</strong> Gets us the efficiency of booking links without the risk of it coming off as transactional</li></ul><figure id="w-node-cfea6145-512c-34a8-e7b2-501f9f458622-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600e0104afcfe91478eedf7c_vimcal-gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>AngelList Venture Funds</h3><p>AngelList makes it possible for a small team (or single person) to run a venture fund. They provide:</p><ul role="list"><li>Operational support to execute deals - reviewing + signing legal docs and wiring funds</li><li>Tax reporting and accounting overhead </li><li>Capital calls and other LP management </li><li>A dashboard with investment and fund performance data (use <a href="https://angel.co/v/venture/calculator">this calculator</a> to see how your fund performs in comparison to others)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Share Your Stack</h3><p>This is our stack at a high level. There’s a lot more we do behind the scenes, and we’re always thinking about ways to improve our workflows, automations and habits. </p><p>While we don’t expect other fund managers to copy our way of working 100%, we’re hoping that sharing our stack and workflows will be useful for other emerging fund managers. </p><p>If you’re a fund manger, we’d love to see the stack powering your fund on Twitter. Tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/vedikaja_in">@vedikaja_in</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Thanks to Ryan Hoover, Varadh Jain and Liam Moore for reading drafts of this.</em></p></div></div>]]>

Besides being cost-effective, outsource programming brings your project extra flexibility and efficiency: you are paying your team for their time and work and don’t have employers’ obligations to them.<br>But where to outsource? In this article, we will provide you with a guide on outsourcing destinations with the best developers.</p>



<h2> What Makes A Country Good Outsourcing Destination?</h2>



<p>Here is what top outsourcing countries are known for:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Lower costs;</li><li>Highly-developed IT market;</li><li>Great educational infrastructure;</li><li>Good English level.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Those are general rules among the best countries for web developers. These are the basics and we recommend choosing from the countries that fit the above criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other questions to ask yourself are:</p>



<ol><li>Can you comfortably align your work with this country’s time zone?</li><li>Is it easy to find a competency you are looking for in this market?&nbsp;</li><li>Do this country’s mentality and cultural values correspond with yours?&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>And that’s pretty much it. Now, let’s see what are the outsourcing destinations that offer the best software developers in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-355x199.jpg 355w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>

<p>Prices $18-40/hr</p>



<p>China has ranked unbelievable 100% in the <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/" rel="nofollow">HackerRank</a> list. It means that it seamlessly passed all of the HackerRank challenges and well, the quality is just perfect.</p>



<p>But before jumping to type “how to hire developers in China” in the search bar, we have to reveal two serious flaws of Chinese outsourcing market. First, is, of course, English – the general population of the country doesn’t speak it. Though, over the last few years, China has proudly received a label ‘moderate’ in the <a href="https://www.ef.com.co/epi/regions/asia/china/" rel="nofollow">EF English proficiency</a> rating. Second concern is the history of data leaks and copyrights violations.</p>



<p>Though if you are determined to hire China-based best developers (and they truly are the best!) we recommend you to thoroughly source for the right reliable partner and properly arrange all the paperwork. Safety first!</p>



<p>We tried to outline a country in each region and, honestly, these are the best countries for software engineers. And the list doesn’t end there as we listed only 5 of these amazing outsourcing destinations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if we were to take an overview and define which region in the world is better for outsourcing. Is it the Americas, Europe, Asia, or maybe Africa?</p>



<h3>Which Area Is The Best For Outsourcing?</h3>



<p>We briefly mentioned the downsides of each outsourcing destination. Argentina is a bit more pricey than other countries, China has copyright issues and the Philippines is behind its competitors due to a lower level of coding expertise. And to be honest, many of these issues exist due to countries’ specifics and politics as well as their locations.&nbsp;While Europe could be expensive due to high pay rates and employment rules and India can have too much of a variance in expertise, how to finally understand what is the best country to hire developers?</p>



<p>We’ll surprise you, but it’s all up to you to decide that. There isn’t a universal mechanism on how to find that perfect team, it really depends on one’s taste.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though our team is located in Ukraine and we truly believe that is the ultimate outsourcing location. Why?</p>



<ol><li>It has a lot of great talent. In 2018, Ukraine was <a href="https://2018.stateofeuropeantech.com/" rel="nofollow">reported</a> to have 200.000+ IT specialists.</li><li>Most of the developers speak English. Ukrainian IT companies offer free classes to their employees.</li><li>Easy-going and professional work ethics. Ukrainians share European values and are extremely easy to work with.&nbsp;</li><li>Reasonable pricing. Ukraine is a very affordable country with a low tax rate. So as a result, the software development prices end up being lower than other European countries.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>The ratings are often subjective. Though we tried to be neutral, yet share our thoughts and experience about the best countries to outsource programming too. We hope you enjoyed reading about the top outsourcing countries.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> is ubiquitous and I often run into it whilst developing or debugging.</p>
<p>When it’s in raw form like this …</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/plaintext.jpg" alt="json as raw text"></p>
<p>it’s hard for a human to interpret.</p>
<p>For small snippets, I could copy-and-paste it into a text file and hand-prettify it. For long snippets, that’s obviously not scalable.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon a very useful tool for interpreting and analysing (extremely) long JSON snippets. The surprising thing is that it’s been around for a long time and I just never noticed. However, once I knew about it, I kept using it, and it’s now my go-to tool for analysing long JSON snippets.</p>
<p>The tool?</p>
<p><strong>Mozilla Firefox.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the web browser. (It also helps that Firefox is my main browser.)</p>
<p>Here is a link to a random JSON file from the internet:</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bengtan/bengtan.github.io/main/content/css-named-colours-picker/dist/main.js.map">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bengtan/bengtan.github.io/main/content/css-named-colours-picker/dist/main.js.map</a></p>
<p>If you click on the link with Firefox you get something human-unfriendly:</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/plaintext.jpg" alt="json as raw text"></p>
<p>However, if you open a file with a <code>.json</code> extension on your local computer , you get …</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/json.png" alt="json in firefox json browser"></p>
<p>… which is a nice and useful and human-friendly json browser with collapsible sections, pretty printing and <strong>filtering</strong>.</p>
<p>(I think Firefox shows the json browser when the mimetype is set to json, and opening a local file with a <code>.json</code> extension is an easy way to set the mimetype.)</p>
<p>I stumbled upon this by chance. But since then, everytime I have a long JSON snippet to debug, I save it to a text file, give it a <code>.json</code> extension and open it with Firefox.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Okay, so installing Firefox just to browse JSON is probably overkill, but this is great for me since I already use it.</p>
<p>I’m glad Firefox is my main browser.</p>

<p>In 2015 I predicted the boom of <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> with my post <a href="https://kurozael.com/ethereum-org-future-of-the-web/">Ethereum.org - Future of the Web</a>, and I'm ready to do it again.</p><h2 id="what-is-nano">What is Nano?</h2><p><a href="https://nano.org/">Nano Currency</a> is <em>digital money for the modern world </em>and it offers a variety of revolutionary features that rival Bitcoin. It has <strong>no fees</strong> for transactions, and it is <strong>eco-friendly</strong> because it does not rely on mining. In addition, Nano transactions are near-instant and the technology is scalable.</p><h2 id="why-not-bitcoin">Why not Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over recent years Bitcoin has seen huge success, and this success has largely been driven by the following things:</p><ul><li>The fear of missing out as the price increases</li><li>Influencers artificially driving up the price</li><li>The potential profitability of mining</li></ul><p>Bitcoin is valuable, because it has value. People are willing to buy Bitcoin. However, we have seen that Bitcoin does not scale very well, and in addition to that, it incurs a huge cost in real-world resources to mine it. Massive GPU farms are mining Bitcoin and using up valuable energy that is better served elsewhere.</p><p>In a modern world, a world where people are conscious of their carbon footprint and the damage that we as human beings are doing to the world, we must be cautious of wasting energy.</p><h2 id="no-mining">No Mining?</h2><p>Because of Nano's very interesting <a href="https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#open-representative-voting-orv">Open Representative Voting</a> mechanism, Nano describes the way it provides value over other cryptocurrencies as such:</p><blockquote>Minimal block size allows for lightweight communication resulting in ultrafast transaction confirmation times</blockquote><blockquote>Without traditional Proof-of-Work and mining, nodes use significantly less energy per transaction than other popular networks</blockquote><blockquote>Emergent centralization forces for node operators are reduced due to the near zero marginal cost of producing consensus in Nano</blockquote><h2 id="why-not-ethereum">Why not Ethereum?</h2><p>I want to be clear here that by supporting Nano I do not detract from my previous views on Ethereum. I maintain that Ethereum is extremely important for the future of the web and this can be seen from the applications developed for it, and the surge in interest over the last 5 years.</p><p><strong>Ethereum is not a currency.</strong> Ethereum provides a very unique and important way to build decentralized applications for the web. We must not mistake Ethereum as your everyday fiat replacement.</p><p><strong>Nano is a Bitcoin alternative. </strong>The difference is that Nano is scalable, fast, fee-less, and contributes far less energy wastage than Bitcoin does. This makes it a great eco-friendly alternative and what has the potential to be the best currency of the future.</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://nano.org/">https://nano.org/</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.nano.org/whitepaper/english/">https://docs.nano.org/whitepaper/english/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/">https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/</a></li></ul><p>For a great read on Nano check out <a href="https://senatusspqr.medium.com/fight-the-climate-crisis-usenano-6e7c22d45b0e">Fight the Climate Crisis, #UseNano</a>, by <a href="https://reddit.com/u/SenatusSPQR">/u/SenatusSPQR</a>, their article delves deeper into to the true value of Nano in preventing the disastrous effects that Bitcoin could have on our planet.</p><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>This is not financial advice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="full_content">
    <p><em>Speculative</em>: the word is often used to describe the crypto market. Still, after what happened with <strong><b>Gamestop </b></strong><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-gme-gamestop/272716/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NYSE:GME)</a> rally, it might be safe to say the speculations — especially once they gain traction in the social networking circles and build up a legit “hype” — can be just as potent at driving the price of stocks up and down as they are at controlling the price of crypto.</p>
<p>Whether or not you participated in the rally, made a profit, or lost a lot of money, there are a few lessons to learn from the rally and the perils of jumping on a perilous, short-lived bandwagon.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The cons of following a hype</b></strong></h2>
<p>It’s effortless to see the <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/03/blackberry-stock-soars-over-250-then-plummets-50/"><u>Gamestop hype</u></a> as some sort of justice that retail investors are serving to the institutional investors who have been shorting Gamestop for quite a while by creating a short squeeze. This rally began from a Reddit group, and it has taken social media, and now even mainstream media, by storm, and it’s understandable why.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this year to the recent peak on Jan. 27, Gamestop stock grew by over 1,900%. That’s more than how much Bitcoin grew from its lowest point after the 2017 crash to its 2020 peak.</p>
<p>And while it was glorious for people who bought and sold at just the right moment, it caused many average investors to lose their shirts to this bet. According to an analyst, that’s what usually happens when a short squeeze meets its inevitable end. For an average investor, betting against the machine (or, more precisely, betting “late” against the machine and not pulling out on time) didn’t go very well.</p>
<p>A small minority won the short squeeze, and even though it was a different minority compared to the elites, the situation only got worse for the average investors.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The good, old long-term holdings</b></strong></h2>
<p>For average investors, playing “trader” every once in a while doesn’t bode very well. Sticking to a good long-term-holding strategy would be safer (even if it’s <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/02/shopify-inc-tsxshop-the-original-gamestop/"><u>not as explosive</u></a>). One reasonably priced stock you might consider, especially for its mouthwatering yield of 8%, is <strong><b>Timbercreek Financials </b></strong><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-tf-timbercreek-financial-corp/273410/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(TSX:TF)</a>. The payout ratio is a bit shaky at 119%, but it’s sustainable so far. And considering the payout ratio history, the company might be able to pull through without slashing its dividends.</p>
<p>The company saw its revenue growing a bit in the last quarter, and if we look back further, the company has been growing its revenues every year since 2012. The company issues a loan to commercial real estate businesses. Most of its loans are short duration, so the company doesn’t have to wait long to realize its gain. Companies like Timbercreek fill the gap left by the traditional lenders — i.e., banks — and real estate businesses seek such companies to fund many of their projects.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Foolish takeaway</b></strong></h2>
<p>One major takeaway from the Gamestop rally is that if you want to play trader or try to capture the upside of a hype that’s building, try doing it with money you can risk losing. So, if you win, you win big. But if you lose, your overall financial standing won’t suffer a severe blow.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>How I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for&nbsp;me.</strong></p>

<p>I know. I know. I know! Using my inbox as my to-do-list is considered <a href="https://www.curaytor.com/blog/Your-Inbox-is-Not-a-To-Do-List">bad practice</a>, and I should feel bad for even trying.</p>

<p>Several well known time management books explicitly advise against this approach. Based on this advice, I have tried different tools and techniques to create a to-do-list <em>separate</em> from my inbox. Yet the honest truth is that all of these attempts didn’t work nearly as well for me as my current Gmail setup.</p>

<p>I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for me. I will try to explain why and how. Perhaps it can work for you too.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-1-most-of-my-tasks-are-emailsalready">Realisation #1: Most of my tasks are emails&nbsp;already.</h2>

<p>My job revolves around communicating with people. Emails inevitably form a large part of that communication. Most of the things I get “done” get done through email. Most of the things I need to get done next will also get done through email.</p>

<p>When I try to keep a to-do-list separate from my inbox, most of the tasks that end up on that to-do-list started life as an email, or will at least result in an email eventually. Moving all of those emails to a separate to-do-list is a chore; moving them back to an email doubly so. Using my inbox as my to-do-list saves me a lot of work simply moving tasks back and forth.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all tasks start with an email. However, effective to-do-list management becomes a lot easier when all tasks are collected in <em>one place</em> (as opposed to being distributed across notebooks, sticky notes on my desk, apps on my phone, and my email).  So, since I have decided to use my inbox as my to-do-list, I need to ensure that somehow  all my tasks arrive as emails there, even those tasks that were not sent to me by other people.</p>

<p>The solution to that problem is rather straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="trick-1-i-email-tasks-tomyself">Trick #1: I email tasks to&nbsp;myself.</h3>

<p>Emailing myself about the odd task that does <em>not</em> already involve an email in my inbox feels like less work than moving everything else back and forth between two lists.</p>

<p>The great thing about this approach is that it is <em>extremely flexible</em>. Sometimes I email myself just a subject. Sometimes I write whole paragraphs of text in the body to remind myself of the details of the task.  Sometimes I add links to other things. Sometimes I reply to myself and post updates to keep track of my progress. Sometimes I carbon copy people who depend on the completion of the task, letting them know that I have documented this task and will get back to them later.</p>

<p>Inbox-as-to-do-list supports rich notes and collaborative tasks out of the box. Everyone I know already has an account and knows how to use this open platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-email-task.png" alt="A screenshot of composing an email addressed to &quot;Bob&quot; telling him it is a reminder for myself to do &quot;that thing&quot;."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-2-time-management-is-attention-management">Realisation #2: Time management is attention management.</h2>

<p>Visual clutter clutters my mind. Anything I can see can distract me. The less there is to see on the screen, the less I will be distracted. To help me focus on the most important tasks, I try to hide everything else.</p>

<h3 id="trick-2-simplifygmail">Trick #2: Simplify&nbsp;Gmail.</h3>

<p>Simplify is an awesome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj">Chrome extension</a> that simplifies the Gmail interface to the bare minimum. Most of the interface elements are useless anyway, because I use the keyboard to navigate (more on that later).</p>

<p>(I used to maintain a personal fork of Simplify that would hide <em>even more</em> of the interface - such as the giant”plus” in the bottom right of the screen - but then I realised I could just use my ad-blocker to block those specific components. Much easier, and just as effective.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-3-separate-gmail-from-thebrowser">Trick #3: Separate Gmail from the&nbsp;browser.</h3>

<p>I use Gmail through the web interface. Often I have several other tabs open at the same time. When I’m browsing, the Gmail tab distracts me. When I’m emailing, the other tabs distract me. Browsing and email are separate tasks that should live in separate apps.</p>

<p>Chrome can <a href="https://www.webnots.com/how-to-create-desktop-shortcut-of-a-site-from-google-chrome/">create a shortcut</a> to Gmail that opens as a new window. That way, Gmail behaves like a separate app, rather than just another tab.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-chrome-create-shortcut.png" alt="A screenshot of Chrome showing the menu entry to create a shortcut."></p>

<h3 id="trick-4snooze">Trick #4:&nbsp;Snooze.</h3>

<p>Tasks I do not need to focus on right now need to be out of <em>sight</em> and out of <em>mind</em>. If they are not, these currently unimportant tasks continue to take up valuable brain space, even when I am not actively working on them.</p>

<p>In my experience, there are two main ways in which a postponed task can impinge on my attention:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I see the task, I will think about the task.</em> Simply looking at a list of tasks is a great way to destroy my concentration. So many things to do! So little time!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I postpone a task, I need to know for sure that I will get back to it later.</em> This one is a bit more subtle, but nevertheless important. A postponed task tends to linger in my mind if I am not absolutely confident that I will be reminded about it later. Fear of forgetting is the mind-killer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I need a way to completely hide a task, but I also need to know that it will be back. Luckily, Gmail has a <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">“snooze” feature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Postpone emails and <strong>temporarily remove them from your inbox</strong> until you need them. Your email <strong>will come back to the top of your inbox</strong> when you want it to, whether that’s tomorrow, next week, or this evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I snooze frequently. I snooze ruthlessly. I snooze without regret.</p>

<p>Snoozing helps me avoid both of the attention traps above: the email disappears from view, and yet I can be absolutely confident that I will be reminded of it in the future, because it will come back directly to my inbox.</p>

<p>Deliberately deciding to postpone a task by actively snoozing it feels much better than pretending to ignore it for a while. Managing my own attention makes it more likely I will actually get to the task eventually. It’s not “goodbye”, it’s “see you later”.</p>

<p>Can it wait? Great!</p>

<h3 id="trick-5-disable-notifications">Trick #5: Disable notifications.</h3>

<p>Email is an asynchronous communication channel. It can usually wait a few hours. I will be checking my to-do-list several times a day in between tasks anyway. Notifications are a distraction and a waste of time.</p>

<h3 id="trick-6-close-gmail-while-working-on-atask">Trick #6: Close Gmail while working on a&nbsp;task.</h3>

<p>The purpose of a to-do-list is to help me decide what task I should be working on next. I do not need my to-do-list if I already know what I should be working on, or while I am working on a task. To avoid being distracted by other tasks on the list, or by new emails arriving in my inbox, I close Gmail while working on a task.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-3-time-spent-managing-the-tasks-is-not-spent-doing-thetasks">Realisation #3: Time spent managing the tasks is not spent doing the&nbsp;tasks.</h2>

<p>The best to-do-list is obviously an empty list with no tasks on it remaining to be done. Empty is what we should be striving for.</p>

<p>I get more things done when I spend more time doing the things to be done. I want to spend as little time as possible navigating, organising, and managing my tasks.</p>

<h3 id="trick-7-use-the-keyboard-for-navigation">Trick #7: Use the keyboard for navigation.</h3>

<p>Using a mouse requires squinting at the screen, searching for the pointer, and directing it with precision. After clicking on the compose or reply button, writing an email then requires switching context and placing both hands on the keyboard for textual input. Over the course of a day, quite a bit of time is spent just navigating around and switching context.</p>

<p>Conversely, using the keyboard for navigation relies more on muscle memory and hammering out well worn patterns (open email, delete email, archive email, snooze email, reply-all, send email, etc). In addition, there is no switching cost between the navigation and the writing of an email.</p>

<p>I avoid using the mouse as much as possible. I use <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">keyboard shortcuts</a> instead. After a few days of practice (and hitting&nbsp;<code>?</code> for the cheatsheet a lot), I never looked back. I now spend far less time navigating, and thus more time doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-shortcuts.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail Keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet."></p>

<h3 id="trick-8-dont-use-filters-orfolders">Trick #8: Don’t use filters or&nbsp;folders.</h3>

<p>I used to have filters and folders. Lots and lots of filters and folders. They were only hiding the real problem: I was getting too many emails. More emails than I could ever hope to read. Worse still, I wasn’t even sure why I was even trying just to <em>read</em> them.</p>

<p>If an email requires an action from me, it should go to my inbox so I can prioritise it. If an email does not require an action from me, I should not be getting it.</p>

<p>Do or do not, there is no FYI.</p>

<p>(I realise this trick is probably the most controversial of all the tricks listed in this post. If you very strongly disagree - and you want to explain to my why I am wrong - feel free to <a href="http://lukasvermeer.nl/#contact">send me an email</a>. You can be assured it will go straight to my inbox.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-9-use-labels-as-visualcues">Trick #9: Use labels as visual&nbsp;cues.</h3>

<p>Some tasks are more important than others. I use coloured labels to draw attention to more urgent and important tasks in my inbox.</p>

<p>My labelling scheme is intentionally simplistic. I use labels as temporary indicators, not for permanent organisation or structure. Organisation and structure are only distractions from the ultimate goal of ending up with an empty list anyway. An empty list does not need either.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-labels-urgent.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail inbox showing two emails one of which is marked as urgent."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-4-i-cannot-do-everything-today">Realisation #4: I cannot do everything today.</h2>

<p>Every morning there are more tasks in my inbox than I can reasonably hope to complete in one day. After denial, anger, bargaining, and depression comes acceptance of the simple fact that effective time management involves deliberately  deciding what <em>not</em> to spend time on.</p>

<h3 id="trick-10-start-the-day-snoozing">Trick #10: Start the day snoozing.</h3>

<p>Every morning I start my day by snoozing everything that I don’t expect to get done that day. This usually takes a few minutes scanning through my inbox. If something new and important comes up later, I immediately reevaluate if another task should now be pushed out to tomorrow. If so, I snooze without delay.</p>

<p>The reality is that I cannot do everything, so I must eventually always choose. Choosing as early as possible ensures that I will have as much time available as possible for the most important tasks. Snoozing as early as possible ensures that less important tasks take up as little of my attention as possible during the day.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I snooze rather than wait or deliberate. Snoozing is a two-way door decision: it is easily reversed. If I happen to finish all my …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>I keep getting more and more powerful laptops, and then offloading more and more processing to the cloud. SOMETHING’S GOTTA GIVE! My local machine doesn’t just run web browsers and chat apps. No, my laptop is still loaded up with dev tools, while all my virtual machines and container clusters now live in the cloud. That helps. But we’re seeing  more and more of the dev tools sneak into the cloud, too.</p>



<p>One of those dev tools is the shell experience. If you’re like me—actually, you’re probably much more advanced than me—you invest in a loaded terminal on your machine. On my Mac, I directly install a few tools (e.g. git, gcloud CLI) but use Homebrew to keep most of my favorite tools close by. </p>

<p>It’s no small effort to maintain a local terminal environment that’s up to date, and authenticated to various endpoints. To make all this easier, each of three hyperscalers now has a “cloud shell” experience that offers developers a hosted, pre-loaded terminal for working with that cloud.</p>



<p><strong>In this blog post, I’m going to look at the cloud shells from AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and see what they really have to offer.</strong> Specifically, I’m going to assess:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Shell access.</strong> How exactly do you reach and use the shell?</li><li><strong>Shells offered</strong>. Bash? Powershell?</li><li><strong>Amount of storage provided</strong>. How much can you stash in your environment?</li><li><strong>Durability period</strong>. How long does each cloud hold onto your compute environment? Storage?</li><li><strong>Platform integrations</strong>. What ways does the shell integrate with the cloud experience?</li><li><strong>Embedded tools</strong>. What comes pre-loaded in the shell?</li><li><strong>Code editing options</strong>. Is there a way to edit files or build apps?</li><li><strong>Compute environment configuration/extensibility</strong>. Can you change the shell environment temporarily or permanently?</li><li><strong>UX and usability controls</strong>. What can you do to tweak the appearance or behavior?</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a look.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Google Cloud, so obviously I’ll have some biases. That said, I’ve used AWS for over a decade, was an Azure MVP for years, and can be mostly fair when comparing products and services. Please call out any mistakes I make!</em></p>







<p>GCP offers a Cloud Shell that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works">runs within a Docker container on a dedicated Google Compute Engine virtual machine</a>. Not that you see any of that. You just see a blinking cursor.</p>



<p>How do you reach that cursor? From within the GCP Console, there’s an ever-present button in the top navigation. Of note, you can also access it via a dedicated link at <a href="https://shell.cloud.google.com/">shell.cloud.google.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you launch the Cloud Shell—and if it’s the first time, you’ll see a brief message about provisioning your infrastructure—you see a new frame on your screen. Note that this is a globally distributed service, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#zone_selection">you’re automatically assigned to the closest geographic region</a>. </p>

<p>Each user gets <strong>5GB of persistent storage</strong> that’s mounted into this underlying virtual machine. This <strong>VM terminates after 20 minutes</strong> of inactivity. If you don’t use Cloud Shell at all for 120 days, the home disk goes away too. </p>



<p>You have <strong>two default shell interpreters</strong> (Bash and sh) at your disposal here. Google Cloud Shell lets you create unique sessions via tabs, and see below that I’m using one tab to list all the shells. I was able to switch between shells, including PowerShell too!</p>

<p>Cloud Shell comes with lots of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#tools"><strong>pre-loaded tools</strong></a> including gcloud, vim, emacs, gradle, helm, maven, npm, pip, git, docker, MySQL client, TensorFlow, and Terraform. It also has built-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#language_support">language support</a> for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, and .NET Core.</p>



<p>If you want tools that aren’t pre-loaded by Google Cloud, you’ve got a few options. You can manually install tools during your session, or, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/configuring-cloud-shell#environment_customization">create a customer_environment script</a> that runs whenever your instance boots up.</p>



<p>What about <strong>platform integrations</strong>? If you call a Google Cloud API that requires credentials, there’s a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/auth">prompt for authorization</a>. There’s also an “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/open-in-cloud-shell">Open in Cloud Shell</a>” feature that makes it simple to create links that trigger opinionated Cloud Shell instances. If you’re writing tutorials or want people to try the code in your git repo, you can generate a link. There’s also a baked-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-cloudshell-command">cloudshell CLI</a> to launch tutorials, download files, and more. You can also use the gcloud CLI on your local workstation to tunnel into the Cloud Shell, thanks to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/cloud-shell">gcloud beta cloud-shell</a> operation.</p>



<p>The Google Cloud Shell also has a full-fledged <strong>code editor built in</strong>. This editor—also available directly via <a href="https://ide.cloud.google.com/">ide.cloud.google.com</a>—gets launched right from the Cloud Shell, either through the button on the Cloud Shell navigation or by invoking the <code>cloudshell edit .</code> command.</p>

<p>This editor is based on Eclipse Theia and has the Cloud Code extensions built in. This means I can create apps, use source control, link to GCP services, run tests, and more. Because Cloud Shell <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview">supports Web Preview</a>, you can also start up web applications and hit a local endpoint.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the overall <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation menu, I have options to send key combinations (e.g. Ctrl+V), change the look and feel (e.g. color, font), upload or download files, run in safe mode, restart the Cloud Shell instance, minimize the frame itself, break it out into its own window, or close the terminal entirely.</p>

<p>With this mix of free storage, a wide set of tools, a fully functional code editor, and easily extendible environments, the Google Cloud Shell feels like a very complete experience.</p>







<p>Azure provides a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell/">Cloud Shell</a> that runs on a temporary virtual machine. Like with GCP, all the infrastructure details are invisible, and users just get a virtual terminal.</p>



<p>You have a few ways to reach Azure’s Cloud Shell. There’s an always-there button in the Portal and a direct link available at <a href="https://shell.azure.com/">shell.azure.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you trigger the Cloud Shell, you quickly get a new resizable frame holding your terminal instance.</p>

<p>The compute instance is available at no charge. These instances use a <strong>5GB persistent storage</strong> image in your file share, and it appears that you pay for that. Like the Google Cloud Shell, the Azure one uses non-durable compute nodes that time out after <strong>20 minutes of inactivity</strong>.</p>



<p>You have <strong>two shell experiences</strong>: bash or PowerShell. Storage is shared between each.</p>

<p>The Azure Cloud Shell comes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/features#tools">absolutely loaded with <strong>tools</strong></a>. You have all the standard Azure tools (Azure CLI, azcopy, etc) along with things like vim, emacs, git, maven, npm, Docker, kubectl, Helm, MySQL client, PostgreSQL client, Cloud Foundry CLI, Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and more. There’s also built-in language support for Go, Ruby. .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PowerShell, and Python. I didn’t see any obvious way to customize the experience that lasts beyond a given session.</p>



<p>As far as <strong>integrations</strong>, it appears there is SSO with Azure Active Directory. There’s also a special PowerShell commandlet for managing Exchange Online. Try to control yourselves. Similar to GCP, the Azure Cloud Shell supports a URL format that lets tutorial creators launch the Cloud Shell from anywhere. Visual Studio Code users can also <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip49.html">integrate the Azure Cloud Shell into their local dev experience</a>.</p>



<p>Azure also provides a handy <strong>code editor</strong> within their Cloud Shell experience. Based on the open source Monaco editor, has a basic file explorer, command palette, and language highlighting.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation bar, you have buttons to restart the shell, configure font style and size, download files, upload files, open the code editor, trigger a local web server, minimize the frame, or shut it down. </p>



<p>All in all, it’s a solid experience. Not as rich as what GCP has, but entirely functional with nice touches like the code editor, and easy switching between bash and PowerShell.</p>







<p>AWS is the newest entrant to the cloud-based terminal with their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/">AWS CloudShell</a>. AWS seems careful to call the host a “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/vm-specs.html#vm-configuration">computing environment</a>” versus ever saying “virtual machine.” It’s possible that you get a container in a shared environment.</p>



<p>It looks like you have one way to reach the CloudShell. There’s a button in the AWS Console navigation bar. </p>

<p>There’s no cost for AWS CloudShell and you get <strong>1GB of persistent storage</strong> (also for free). The service is available in a handful of AWS regions (3 in the US, 1 in Ireland, 1 in Tokyo). Sessions expire after 20-30 minutes, and <strong>data is held for 120 days</strong>.</p>



<p>AWS CloudShell has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/working-with-cloudshell.html#using-shells"><strong>three shell experiences</strong></a> including bash, PowerShell, and z shell. </p>

<p>The AWS CloudShell comes with a handful of useful <strong>pre-loaded tools</strong>. You get the AWS tools (e.g. AWS CLI, AWS SAM), as well as git, make, ssh, and vim. You can modify the default environment by creating a .bashrc script that runs whenever the bash shell fires up. There’s native language support for Node.js and Python. </p>



<p>There’s one <strong>platform integration</strong> I noticed, which helps you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/tutorial-code-commit.html">push and pull code</a> from AWS CodeCommit. </p>



<p>There are some nice touches in the AWS CloudShell <strong>user experience</strong>. I like that you can stack tabs (session) or put them side by side. You can also download and upload files. AWS also offers settings to change the font size or switch from dark mode to light mode.</p>

<p>AWS offers a functional experience that’s basic, but useful for those living in an AWS world.</p>



<p>It’s great to see all the major clouds offering this functionality. GCP objectively has the most feature-rich experience, but each one is useful. Try them out, and see if they can make your dev environment simpler.</p>

                    <p><em>Car companies are halting production because their vendors can't supply electronic components. Laptops are struggling to meet demand because they don’t have computer chips. Mobile phone companies are having to pay through the roof to source critical parts. And it’s all happening because the world is witnessing an unprecedented semiconductor shortage. So in today’s Finshots, we talk about this and more.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>Companies dabbling with semiconductors are in a highly specialized business. They are few and far between and they spend billions of dollars planning for the future.</p><p>As we wrote in one of our articles <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/nvidia-arm-40-billion-deal/">earlier </a>—</p><blockquote>Intel spent close to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/how-intel-makes-a-chip" rel="noopener">$8.5 billion</a> in building a fabricator that could produce its flagship E5 chips. These were sophisticated enterprise-level chips and they weren’t easy to produce. The research and development cost $11.5 billion. Mistakes cost extra. And this doesn’t include time commitments. Companies have to plan years in advance to build this kind of capacity and scaling production can be quite a challenging task.</blockquote><p>So you can’t wake up one day and suddenly ramp up supply. It’s almost next to impossible to achieve this kind of scale. And the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — the largest semiconductor company in the world haven’t been investing aggressively over the past few years. As one article <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/mega-wave-capex-cycle-logic-semiconductor-industry/">notes</a> — <em>“From 2015 to 2019, the capital investment cycle remained conservative across the industry.”</em> It further goes on to add —<em> “Taking a closer look at the semiconductor capital investment trends during the past few years, it becomes clear that under-investment is the root cause of demand-supply imbalance, particularly in logic (non-memory) semiconductor industry.”</em></p><p>And that’s the crux of the problem. We didn’t think we’d need this many semiconductors. Especially the kind we use for computing stuff. The kind that goes on cars, gaming consoles, mobile phones and laptops. And it’s now pushing us to the brink. However, semiconductor companies should have jumped into action last year when it became evident that the supply lines were being stretched thin. They knew it was inevitable. And truth be told, they would have done it if it weren’t for Covid.</p><p>Expanding capacity in the middle of a pandemic isn’t exactly easy. So they were forced to defer plans. And if reports are to be believed, companies are gearing for a massive capacity building exercise this year after having struggled to expand last year. TSMC, for instance, said it would raise nearly $9 billion in a bid to expand in 2021. You’ll likely see other companies follow suit as well. So if all goes well, the problem should be alleviated by the end of 2021.</p><p>However, the current predicament isn’t a result of the supply crunch alone. Companies like Huawei, for instance, have been building semiconductor reserves over the past few years. And the pandemic forced people to spend on sophisticated consumer appliances that further dented supply lines. As an article in Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/chip-shortage-spirals-beyond-cars-to-phones-and-game-consoles">notes </a>—<em> “Industry executives also blame excessive stockpiling, which began over the summer when <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/40978Z:CH" rel="noopener">Huawei Technologies Co.</a> — a major smartphone and networking gear maker — began hoarding components to ensure its survival from crippling U.S. sanctions. Led by Huawei, Chinese imports of chips of all kinds climbed to almost $380 billion in 2020…Rivals including Apple, worried about their own caches, responded in kind. At the same time, the stay-at-home era spurred sales of home appliances from the costliest TVs to the lowliest air purifiers, all of which now come with smart, customized chips.”</em></p><p>Also, the impact of this shortage isn’t uniform across the board. The likes of Apple can negotiate better than small time vendors. Meaning, if you are in an industry that sources a lot of semiconductors then you have better bargaining power, plain and simple. Auto manufacturers unfortunately rely on third party vendors who don't source a lot of semiconductors. At least not on a relative scale. So they've been affected real bad. </p><p>Bottom Line — The semiconductor shortage is pulling multiple industries to its knees and now you know why.</p><p>Until then...</p><p>Share this Finshots on <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20semiconductor%20shortage.%20https://bit.ly/3jFyoi7">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3p2dCKB&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20semiconductor%20shortage.">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/the-great-semiconductor-shortage">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The design and implementation of programming languages fascinates me. A programming language enables a text file to both accurately communicate to another person a problem’s solution and control a computer’s execution. The influence a language’s feature set has on the way a programmer thinks about problems and their solutions is an endlessly captivating idea. The world of programming languages is amazing.</p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in implementing higher-level languages in lower-level languages. I think I was attracted to Math in school because the construction of new ideas based on a small set of axioms seems like good, clear thinking. Building up to a high-level programming language from below has the same appeal for me.</p>

<p>This article <em>may</em> be the first of many recording the scratching of an itch that apparently needs scratching. I cannot seem to ignore it even if I try. A book on Scheme or implementing interpreters or compilers always seems to find its way into my hands. I want to implement Scheme from Scratch: an interpreter, a compiler, a JIT, etc. I want to see how it all happens. If you do too then you may enjoy following along.</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This exploration is not for novice programmers. It is a tutorial introduction for novice language implementor and enthusiasts from the perspective of a novice language implementor and enthusiast.</p>

<p>You have experience programming on a UNIX or UNIX-like system. Any of Linux, BSD, or Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X is fine. You have used common developer tools like <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code>. Your copy of <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">K&amp;R&nbsp;2e</a> is a little dog eared but cherished. You might even have a copy of <a href="http://www.apuebook.com/">APUE&nbsp;2e</a>.</p>

<p>You have some prior exposure to Intel&nbsp;386 Assembly language. You don’t need to be an Assembly master. Just some general knowledge about registers, the stack and heap, and some basic instructions. Jeff&nbsp;Duntemann’s <a href="http://www.duntemann.com/assembly.htm">Assembly&nbsp;Language Step&nbsp;By&nbsp;Step</a><a>, now in its third edition, is a light and enjoyable introduction providing a sufficient level of Assembly knowledge.</a></p><p><a>If someone even mentions </a><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>, your head fills with thoughts of master magicians casting alluring spells. SICP&nbsp;2e has spent a lot of time on your bedside table and you’ve done many of the exercises when you really should have been doing other things (like I should be doing now.) SICP showed you the implementation of Scheme <em>in</em> Scheme. This chicken and egg paradox bothers you and you wonder <strong>“How do I implement Scheme from Scratch?”</strong></p>


<h2>“Scheme”</h2>

<p>There are many versions of “Scheme”. <a href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">The Original Lambda Papers</a> show various ancestors. I’ve seen threads mentioned in those papers. SICP implements several versions of Scheme. The main language used in SICP doesn’t have macros. SICP shows the implementation of a lazy Scheme. There is the official <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/busarch/1178-1990_desc.html">IEEE Scheme standard</a> and the <i>de facto</i> RnRS standards: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.39.1890">R4RS</a>, <a href="http://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>, <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a>.</p>

<p>It isn’t totally clear what makes a Scheme “Scheme”. I’m not going to worry too much about exactly what a language must have to be enough of a Scheme to earn the name. I know it needs at least s-expressions; garbage collection; symbols; first-class, lexically scoped procedures; and proper tail calls.</p>


<h2>“from Scratch”</h2>

<p>What does it mean to implement “from Scratch”? Upon what foundation will we build Scheme? Do we have a working physical computer, an operating system, an assembler, a linker, a C compiler, a Scheme interpreter or compiler, another high-level language?</p>

<p>At least to me, “from Scratch” implies building up towards Scheme from some lower-level. If a system already has another high-level language then, philosophically, why not just write programs in that language? We could, after all. So implementing Scheme with the assistance of another high-level language is out.</p>

<p>Does the system already have Scheme? No. If it did, we’d use it and you wouldn’t need to implement Scheme. (Or if the system does have Scheme, at least we’d pretend it didn’t so we could enjoy implementing it ourselves.)</p>

<p>I will assume we have working computer with a 32&nbsp;bit Intel&nbsp;386-style processor, UNIX-like operating system with an assembler and linker. These are all very interesting low-level details but building up towards a Scheme system from a level where one of these is missing is out of scope for this discussion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the grey area is whether or not the system has a C compiler or not and if we want to use that to build up to Scheme. All UNIX-like systems have a C compiler. The operating system and tools are probably written mostly in C. Many high-level languages, like Scheme, are implemented in C. Working in C is definitely working at a lower-level then working in Scheme. A testament to the low-level of C is that C is often referred to as “portable Assembly”. Given these things we can take a C compiler, <code>gcc</code>, as one of our available tools.</p>


<h2>Scheme from Scratch Implementations</h2>

<p>There are many possible ways to implement Scheme from Scratch:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Bootstrap Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A quick and <em>dirty</em> Scheme interpreter implemented in C. This should be less than 1000 lines to implement. Not many features and slow execution but enough of an interpreter to bootstrap us into the world of Scheme.</dd>

	<dt>Compiling Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A Scheme to i386 Assembly compiler written in Scheme. First executed with Bootstrap Scheme but later self compiling. See <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/">An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Compile-to-C Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A Scheme to C compiler written in Scheme. Provides great portability because C is the intermediate language on the way to machine code.</dd>
  
	<dt>Byte Code VM Scheme</dt>
	<dd>An embeddable Scheme virtual machine based on a byte-code compiler and interpreter. Written in ANSI C and very portable. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chibi-scheme/">Chibi Scheme</a>, for example.</dd>

	<dt>JIT Engine Scheme</dt>
	<dd>An embeddable Scheme engine based on a just-in-time compiler for i386 and with   sophisticated garbage collection. I’m not sure if this will be written in C or Compiling Scheme.</dd>

	<dt>Platform Scheme</dt>
	<dd>Compile Scheme to target a platform like <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/index.jsp">JVM</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ddk909ch.aspx">.NET’s&nbsp;CLR</a>, <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a>, or <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>. By targeting an existing platform, a lot of education and fun would be missed. It certainly wouldn’t count as “from Scratch”. It is necessary to write the target platform also.</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can see that it is a big itch. I don’t know how long it will take to scratch or what will come of it all but will surely be fun implementing Scheme from Scratch.</p>

 <li>It only takes four days to produce and can carry payloads of upto 100 kilos into lower earth orbit (LEO).</li>
 <li>While the first company to be successful in such an endeavour, there are others who are fast catching up and realise the value of 3D printed engines versus conventional assembly.</li>
</ul><p>Rocket engines are tough to build, and they’re even tougher to 3D print because all the details have to be ‘just right’ for the rocket to work successfully. But, an Indian space startup based out of Chennai has pulled off this mammothian task. 
</p><p>
Agnikul Cosmos has successfully fired its higher stage semi-cryogenic rocket engine called Agnilet. “This entire engine, Agnilet, is just one piece of hardware from start to finish and has zero assembled parts,” said co-founder and CEO Srinath Ravichandran.
</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1GVGbn4-U4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 

<p>Normally, rocket engines have 100s of different parts that have to be built individually. This includes things like injectors which inject fuel into the engine, cooling channels that ensure the engine doesn’t overheat and the igniter which actually kindles propellants to push the rocket off the ground.
</p>
<p>Agnilet, on the other hand, is a three-in-one solution. It takes all three of these modules and puts them into a single piece of hardware. There is no complex assembly and the turnaround time for the entire setup is less than four days. 
</p><p>    
The rocket engine is capable of carrying upto 100 kilos to low earth orbit (LEO), which is around 700 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. That’s only a fraction of what the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is capable of and possibly only enough to carry a single satellite at most.
</p><p>

<strong>Agnikul may be the first to be successful, but it’s not alone<br></strong>Agnikul was the first Indian space startup to enter into a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Department of Space (DoS) under the newly established Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe).

<p>Another space startup that’s hot its heels is Hyderabad-based Skyroot Aerospace founded by former Indian Space Research Organisation (</p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="ISRO" keynameseo="isro" actualkeyword="isro">ISRO</keyword><p>) scientists Pawan Kumar Chandana and Naga Bharath Daka. In September last year, they too revealed their fully 3D printer cryogenic rocket engine dubbed Dhawan-I. 
</p><p>
    Dhawan-I will be used to power the Vikram-II rocket, which Skyroot is also building from scratch. 
</p><p>The startup entered an NDA with the DoS earlier this month on February 2. They will be able to use ISRO’s test and launch facilities to test their Vikram-I rocket and eventually Dhawan-I as well. 
</p><p>
    The global space industry is expected to generate $1.1 trillion or more by 2040, according to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space" rel="nofollow">Morgan Stanley</a> — more than triple its current value of $350 billion. And, new space engine technology like 3D printed rocket engines are expected to play a big role in this explosion of value.
</p><p>
But even international players like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
<a target="_blank" href="https://3dprint.com/278184/startup-accelerator-ursa-major-is-3d-printing-rocket-engines-to-grow-space-economy/" rel="nofollow">Ursa Major</a> and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin are only 3D printing components for rocket engines. This means that putting together these engines and making sure they work is still a fairly complicated task. 
</p><p>The only US-based startup close to producing a fully 3D printed rocket engine is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://manufactur3dmag.com/firehawk-aerospace-raises-2-million-for-3d-printed-rocket-engines/" rel="nofollow">Firehawk Aerospace</a>, and they only just raised the $2 million needed to start on their project.

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of the doctors ever told me my Dad was dying. Not the surgeon at Maine Med who first went in to do the biopsy of the lung. Not the surgeon at Mass General who did the biopsy of a lymph node. Not the oncologist at Maine Cancer Care the first few chemo treatments, which were also the only ones I could attend thanks to COVID. None of them.</p>



<p>But they didn’t have to. Mesothelioma is hard to Google, because the search results are heavily polluted by law firms in search of riches from ignorant or irresponsible manufacturers, but you can get the gist. And the gist is that it’s not good.</p>



<p>Mesothelioma is a malignant tumor that is caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. How my father, who spent his career on Wall Street theoretically well removed from the material that used to be common in building materials, firefighting gear and the like ended up with these fibers in his lung is an open question. We’ll never know for sure, but the evidence strongly suggests that it’s a consequence of my father going back to work downtown shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#11_September_2001_attacks">WikiPedia</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>As New York City’s World Trade Center collapsed following the September 11 attacks, Lower Manhattan was blanketed in a mixture of building debris and combustible materials. This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete. More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings’ destruction.</p></blockquote>



<p>As an aside, before someone mentions the 9/11 victims fund, he was aware of it. Given the limited pool of funds, however, this was a non-starter for him because he would never have been willing to take money away from the first responders or their families. </p>



<p>Anyway, my father’s commute for four decades had him walk off the Path trains into the Trade Center en route to the Exchange every day. I know this because I did it with him one summer. He was fortunate enough to be on vacation up here in Maine not just for the attempted bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 but for 9/11 as well. It would be as tragic as it would be ironic if he survived the attack in 2001 by not being there but the air he breathed when he returned to work ended up killing him twenty years later.</p>



<p>Pragmatist that he was, however, he’d have taken that trade.</p>



<p>It’s a similar trade, in fact, to the one he took when he was first diagnosed with cancer while at Harvard Business School in the early seventies. Cancer treatments were a little less sophisticated all those years ago, and to attack the cancer that he had the doctors irradiated large swaths of his body. Today, they can apparently target areas smaller than a dime. He was told that he had an 8% chance of dying within six weeks, and a 92% chance of living out most of the rest of a normal lifespan – albeit with some side effects.</p>



<p>Side effects that he accepted without complaint. His immune system went haywire, for one, and he developed allergies, the worst of which was poison ivy. If that so much as touched him, it was in his blood stream and off to the races. My childhood memories are always a little hazy, but I remember that. The side effects changed his hair color and density, and it left him permanently immuno-compromised. It’s weird when you’re a kid and your Dad’s mustache randomly grows in bright red.</p>



<p>Not that any of that mattered much: I don’t remember him missing a single day of work, ever.</p>



<p>For fifty years, the deal that he’d accepted was a good deal. Despite a few scares along the way, the cancer never came back until he noticed being short of breath and developed a chronic cough two years ago. Never one to visit a doctor unnecessarily, and probably for good reason given his history, he nevertheless went and ended up on the track that led to the diagnosis and the year that was 2020.</p>

<p>Christmas 2019 was a sad affair. My Dad had been diagnosed merely days before, and his weight loss left him gaunt and weary. When shown pictures of the dinner later, he replied with typical bleak humor, “shit, I look dead.” Still, we tried to take an optimistic tack with 2020. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about cancer today, it’s that your primary goal if they can’t cure you immediately is to buy time, because they might be able to in future.</p>



<p>So that is what my Dad set out to do. Always goal oriented, his assessment was that based on trajectory at the time, he was unlikely to make it until the Fourth of July. Thus his goal was to make it beyond that date. To that end, he promised his oncologist one thing: that as long as they would agree to treat him, he would show up. At times, this meant employing some gamesmanship, no stranger to the lifelong athlete. As he continued to bleed weight he couldn’t afford to lose, he slyly wore heavier and heavier shoes to his weigh-in’s so they wouldn’t remove him from treatment.</p>



<p>So intent was he on continuing treatment, in fact, that he literally broke himself out of the hospital to get the toxic substance injected into his body. He’d fallen and shattered his femur – in retrospect, likely due to the fact that his heart had begun to stop unpredictably due either to a bad valve, arrhythmia’s or both. </p>



<p>All in all in 2020, he dealt with the cancer, a bad valve in his heart, a congenital heart murmur gone rogue, five surgeries, and the broken leg. To add insult to injury, his access to the thing that made him most happy – his grandchildren, and to a lesser extent his children – was drawn down to a trickle thanks to the pandemic.</p>



<p>Insult, injury or otherwise, he fought to the last. Every time he seemed to take a hard won step forward, some new fresh hell would drop him back ten steps, or even twenty. But he was a fighter, and every time he got knocked down, he picked himself up off the mat and waded back in.</p>



<p>He died as a fighter, Monday morning. And despite the terminal prognosis, the cancer never won. His body may have ultimately failed him, but his spirit never did. It was his heart, or maybe his brain, it’s not clear which, that killed him. Not the cancer. </p>

<p>That terrible endurance was something I never wanted to learn from my Dad, but I did. He taught me many other things, some of which I wrote down in an admittedly <a href="http://thisistheway.us/">lengthy letter</a> to my then unborn daughter. Here are ten that I’ve thought about this week.</p>



<h2>Have Priorities</h2>



<p>My Dad grew up with very little. What wealth his family on one side had had at one point had largely petered out, and while his father always worked, you don’t become a minister for the money. Still, the family prioritized education, and so he went to Williams like his father and brother before him, and from there it was on to Harvard Business School. That provided him with access to jobs that featured, let’s just call it, high income potential. For the first time in his life, he had money. And but for his kids, that could have been his life.</p>



<p>Instead, he eventually came to a fork in the road. Down one path lay wealth and comfort; the other was precarious, stressful self-employment as an independent floor broker – the upside of which was predictable hours that allowed him to get home in time to coach my brother and I, first in soccer, later adding lacrosse in the spring.</p>



<p>Every family has different choices to make, and I can’t imagine the financial stress both of my parents bore. But I think I can speak for my brother when I say that I’m glad he chose us.</p>



<h2>You Do What You Have To</h2>



<p>When my Dad enlisted in the army, he and my mother were dirt poor and living in a trailer in Georgia. Every dollar, therefore, was precious. As a semi-related aside, if you get the chance, ask my Mom what it was like to work at a K-Mart in the deep south with a wicked Boston accent.</p>



<p>Anyway, after finding out that paratroopers got an extra pittance per month, my Dad signed up for jump school. The only problem with this transaction was that my Dad was terrified of heights. Every morning he had to jump, then, he’d get up and vomit because he was scared. But dollars were precious, so he got his wings.</p>



<p>Later, in business school, he had to go in regularly to get blasted with high doses of radiation. This had the intended effect of killing off the cancer and the unintended effect of giving him nearly full time nausea. He didn’t intend to miss class, however, so he merely requested a seat on the aisle so he could get to the bathroom quickly. All professors but one complied; the hold out required an appeal to the dean. He had no such impediments while competing in tennis tournaments during treatment, however; he’d merely vomit in between sets.</p>



<p>My Dad never really sat us down to talk about working through fear, sickness or injury. We just watched him.</p>



<h2>Be Yourself</h2>



<p>All the years my Dad worked on the various exchanges, he dressed – in general – as comfortably as the dress code permitted. He had nice suits and ties when they were needed, but his normal uniform was LL Bean chinos, a plain white shirt, his trading jacket and one of a couple of ties kept in his desk. That was who he was. My Dad paid no more attention to NYC fashion then he did to bars after work or coke in the bathrooms. His worst vice was coke, the soda.</p>



<p>It never occurred to me that this was in some way different or unique until I moved to New York City after college. Some friends had Armani suits and Gucci loafers. I was much more likely to be the one who kept us from getting into a bar because I was dressed like a 1930’s rail-riding hobo.</p>



<p>Like my Dad, for better or for worse, I knew who I was, and I never worried too much about what everyone else was up to.</p>



<h2>Let Your Kids Be Who They Are</h2>



<p>My Dad was an athlete all his life, and a very good one. Great, even. My brother and I grew up on stories of his freak athleticism, how he started on his college …</p></div></div>

February 9, 2021 | https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Startups and technology canâ€™t solve <em>all</em> the worldâ€™s problems, but they can solve a good amount of them. Now more than ever, we need people to build the next generation of companies that will tackle some of the worldâ€™s biggest problems. There are a lot of unknowns right now, but at Wilbur Labs, we believe this is the best time to start a company â€“ ever. </p><p>Wilbur Labs is a startup studio turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. Since 2016 we have built and invested in 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>, and more.</p><p>We plan to launch several companies every year, which requires building a solid pipeline of ambitious ideas. Over the years, we have used three primary approaches to get startup ideas: build for the future, solve existing problems better, or solve personal problems.</p></div><h2>1. Build for the Future</h2><div><div><p>The future is not static. It is built by people who have a vision for what the future should look like, and those who have the willingness to work hard and take the risks necessary to get there. A great way to get startup ideas is to sit down and think about what the future should look like. Ask yourself the following questions: </p><p><em>How are behaviors changing? Which changes will stick? </em><br><em>What long-term problems have been created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? </em><br><em>What priorities and values have changed?</em><br><em>What are the biggest problems today?</em><br><em>What will be the biggest problems tomorrow?</em><br><em>What new problems can technology solve today?</em><br><em>How can new technology change the way existing problems are solved?</em></p></div><p>2020 is a year that consumer behaviors are changing and evolving at a faster rate than ever before. Emerging trends that would have taken 5 to 10 years to mature are instead maturing overnight. There is a large opportunity to think about changing trends and build companies ahead of the curve. eCommerce, Employment, Insurance, and Mobile On-Demand are just a few industries where we are boosting investments as a result of new long-term trends.</p><p>When thinking about the future, itâ€™s important to think and plan for the long-term. The best ideas can be built into big, sustainable businesses that can solve problems and create value over the long-term. Avoid short-termism, also known as ideas which may seem solid in the short-term but have a short expiration date.</p><p>Barkbus is a great example of a business that is building for the future. Back in 2017, the world was rapidly transitioning to direct-to-your-door services. Despite that, the way most people got their dogs groomed hadnâ€™t changed. Pet parents still went to the salon, which was a time consuming and stressful experience for both dogs and their parents. Barkbus launched to <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/announcements/why-we-acquired-barkbus">make mobile grooming the new norm</a> for pet parents and their dogs. </p></div><h2>2. Solve Existing Problems Better</h2><div><p>We believe the best companies solve real problems. These problems may be completely new problems, or they may be existing problems that have not been solved well by existing companies to date.</p><p>Do not discount existing problems when generating startup ideas. Some of the largest, most impactful companies throughout history were built by solving existing problems better than others. Google did not invent the search engine, search ads, web based email, or maps. Apple did not invent the smartphone, the tablet, or the smart watch. Facebook did not invent social networking. The list goes on and on. What these companies did is provide a better experience than the existing companies. At Wilbur Labs, we refer to this as â€œcreating a 10x experience.â€� </p><p>Next time you have an idea and someone says, â€œdoesnâ€™t X do that?â€� â€” instead of throwing away your idea, first decide if thereâ€™s an opportunity to 10x the experience. Competitors are a good sign as it means there is a real problem people care about. Challenging the status quo is a great way to solve big problems and build a large business. </p><p>When we built Joblist, we did so because despite multiple large job boards, the job search process hasnâ€™t changed in 20 years â€” when job listings first moved online. We saw an opportunity to 10x the job search experience by introducing more personalization and collaboration tools to a traditionally generic and lonely process. Job seekers have embraced this new approach, which allowed Joblist to help millions of job seekers by powering over 500,000 new applications <a href="https://www.joblist.com/news/why-we-launched-joblist">before their public launch</a>.</p></div><h2>3. Solve Personal Problems</h2><div><div><p>Many of the best startup ideas are personal problems that you have faced. What are the biggest problems that you wish were solved? How many others face the same problem? If you experience a problem, then you are uniquely positioned to solve it.</p><p>More often than not, entrepreneurship is not a way to get rich quickly. You will likely need to work harder and longer, with higher stress and more at stake than working a regular job. The journey is absolutely worth it for the right person, but itâ€™s important that you care enough about what you are working on enough to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life. This will be easier if you care deeply about the problem you are solving.</p></div>
<p>A great example of this is why we launched VacationRenter. At Wilbur Labs, we had quarterly company offsites where we book a vacation rental to work for a few days in a different city. Every time we searched for a rental, it took hours of planning and work. We found ourselves scrolling through pages of search results and jumping from site to site, trying to find the ideal place for the best price. This was a frustrating experience and we knew we could make the search for a vacation rental better for others like us â€” which is why <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/news/why-we-launched-vacationrenter">we launched VacationRenter</a>. If you experience a problem, it is likely that others are experiencing it too. </p>
<p>VacationRenter became the fastest growing travel startup ever, generating over $1 billion gross bookings in 2020. This milestone confirms that we werenâ€™t the only travelers who had a frustrating experience finding the perfect rental.</p></div><h2>Next Steps</h2><div><p>At Wilbur Labs, the best startup ideas check a few key boxes:</p><ul><li><strong>Solves a problem.</strong> Could your idea solve a big problem, and have a large positive impact on a significant number of people?</li><li><strong>Builds a sustainable business. </strong>Can the idea be turned into a sustainable business that creates value over the long-term?</li><li><strong>Uniquely positioned.</strong> Are you uniquely positioned to solve the problem and you want to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life?</li></ul></div><figure><img alt="best-startup-ideas-venn-diagram" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/ideas-venn-diagram.png"></figure><div><p>No matter how good an idea is, we believe that ideas alone are worthless unless you take initiative to execute. Execution is everything. Everyone has big ideas â€” no startup ideas are truly unique. Being able to execute on those ideas is what will turn that idea into a business.</p><p>For any idea, the most important next step is thorough research where you pair your initial idea with independent and external information.

          <p><small>Posted by Matthew Wild on February 9 2021</small></p><p><em>There is a significant difference between developing and promoting a
protocol (such as XMPP) and a product (such as Signal). Both approaches
have their advantages and disadvantages. This post details how and why
Snikket aims to strike a balance between the two.</em></p>
<h2 id="products-vs-protocols">Products vs Protocols</h2>
<p>This past weekend I gave a talk at the (virtual) FOSDEM conference about
a topic I’ve been thinking about a lot the past few years - the differences
between developing a product and developing a protocol.</p>
<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://peertube.thepacket.exchange/videos/watch/96e35d83-e70c-4a87-868b-f9cbeb48e1d0">here</a>, but there were many things I
wanted to touch upon that wouldn’t fit into the 20 minute slot. This post
will cover the same topics, but expands on some of the points I
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="previously-in-open-protocols">Previously, in open protocols…</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (once known as Jabber) for over 15
years. It is now over 20 years since XMPP’s inception, and over this
time XMPP, along with the rest of the tech industry, has seen significant
change.</p>
<p>XMPP began life in the late 1990s, as an attempt to break into the
messaging silos of that era. The names and logos may have been different,
but it was a very similar landscape to today - oversized tech companies
fighting each other for control over people who simply want to use the
internet for what it was designed, communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Email got lucky. A standard protocol managed to break down the walls of
even the final fortress of resistance, AOL. This was achieved largely
because the adoption of standard protocols by smaller providers allowed
them to form a network together that began to threaten even America’s
largest ISP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we never quite reached that point with instant messaging.
However that hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to strive for a
similar outcome even as our symbol of hope, the open email network, is
under threat today more than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite numerous projects, communities and organizations campaigning for
decades in favour of open messaging systems, the space is still
dominated by large silos. The largest the world has ever known. WhatsApp
alone has over <em>2 billion</em> users. That means a significant portion of
the world’s communications are flowing through a single company. A
company that has a simple business model - amassing data about people
and leveraging that data to help their actual customers (other
businesses) influence the beliefs, biases and behaviour of the users of
their platforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-slippery-slope">The slippery slope</h2>
<p>Despite the dizzying numbers associated with WhatsApp today, it had more
humble beginnings. Founded by two ex-Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and
Jan Koum, it began as a simple messaging app for iPhones. The server was
originally based on an <a href="https://www.process-one.net/blog/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">open-source XMPP server</a>, and
used the XMPP protocol. However the goal of WhatsApp was not openness
and federation, and they soon diverged far from standard XMPP.</p>
<p>As WhatsApp grew, early users may recall that they also began charging a
small fee for accounts ($1/year). Their reasoning was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>â€œRemember, when advertising is involved <strong>you the user</strong>
    are the product.</p>
    <p>Your data isn't even in the picture. We are simply not interested in any of it.</p>
    <p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp,
    we say â€˜Have you considered the alternative?â€™â€œ</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/why-we-don-t-sell-ads">
         <strong>WhatsApp blog post â€œWhy we don't sell adsâ€œ, June 2012</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, just two years later it was announced that WhatsApp had
been acquired by the internet’s fastest-growing advertising platform,
Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite declaring to the EU competition commission that linking an
individual’s data between WhatsApp and Facebook was not technically
feasible this is exactly what they went on to do, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/facebook-fined-eu-whatsapp-european-commission">leading to a â‚¬94
million fine</a>. Little by little, Facebook has been
loosening their privacy policies to allow them to absorb WhatsApp data
into their daily operations.</p>
<p>So when, in early 2021, the latest update to the privacy policy gave users
of the platform a clear ultimatum to allow this sharing or close their
account, many users wisely began to seek alternatives. Finally, the
moment we had been waiting for had arrived.</p>
<p>Many of us advocates of open communications seized the opportunity, and
recommendations were soon flying around for the wide range of alternative
messaging systems we’ve been building these past years. “Use XMPP!”,
“Use Matrix!”, “Use Signal!”, to name a few.</p>
<p>Despite a marked increase of signups on XMPP and Matrix servers, of
these three it was Signal that won by far the largest share of new users.
Millions of people flocked from WhatsApp and overloaded Signal’s servers,
resulting in disrupted message delivery across Signal’s service for days.</p>
<p>This service disruption was possible because, unlike XMPP and Matrix,
Signal is centralized, and all messages flow through a single set of
servers, the same model as WhatsApp.</p>
<p>XMPP and Matrix are both federated networks. Rather than a single entity
controlling the network, there are many servers to choose from, run by
many different independent providers. Even with a server down,
overloaded or closed to new users, the rest of the network continues
functioning.</p>
<p>So why did Signal receive millions of users, and XMPP/Matrix did not?</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>At this point it’s impossible not to reference <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The Ecosystem is Moving</a>,
a 2016 blog post by Signal’s founder and CEO, Moxie Marlinspike. In this
post Moxie details all the problems he sees with protocols becoming
open internet standards. In particular, that they lose their ability to
evolve, and that evolution is vital to compete in our industry’s “moving
ecosystem”.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there
       until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly
       frozen in time circa the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Well. Far from being frozen in time, XMPP has changed significantly in the past
20 years.</p>

    <img src="https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/xmpp_2004_2021.png">

<p>Just some of the things we have now that we didn’t have in the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption using OMEMO (based on Signalâ€™s protocol and
audited), with multi-device and offline capabilities</li>
<li>Audio/video calling (now 2nd generation, encrypted, WebRTC-compatible)</li>
<li>Mobile optimizations (bandwidth, connectivity, push notifications)</li>
<li>Full cross-device message synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these things didn’t even exist as concepts back when XMPP began.
Adding them was only possible due to XMPP’s smart design: a core
protocol, with a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">suite of extensions</a> (known as XEPs). New
extensions are added as needed, and irrelevant ones get deprecated.</p>
<p>To help keep everyone on the same page as the protocol evolves, the XMPP
Standards Foundation (XSF) annually publishes the recommended XEPs that
different classes of software (e.g. instant messaging,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/social.html">social networking</a>, or <a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html">smart devices</a>) should be
implementing. These round-ups are known as <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites.html">compliance suites</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation site <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/">Modern XMPP</a> also serves as a useful reference
guide for modern XMPP implementations (including UI/UX considerations,
which are not covered by the protocol-level documentation).</p>
<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth">The unfortunate truth</h2>
<p>The effort required in advancing the protocol <em>is</em> significant. And that’s
not even counting the implementation work. XMPP has a diverse and open
ecosystem. There is no single “XMPP client”, instead the ecosystem is
composed of… just about anyone who decides to write XMPP software. The
vast majority of this software is free/open-source, and developed by
volunteers and communities.</p>
<p>Publishing protocol updates does not magically mean the changes are
implemented in all XMPP software overnight. Some projects are more active
than others, and each contributor is an individual with their own life
and work schedule. Unfortunately this means that it’s very difficult to
evolve the protocol and keep everyone 100% in sync. Luckily XMPP’s
modular design makes it easy for some software to advance ahead of others
without having to lose backwards compatibility with the rest of the
network. If we didn’t have this feature, we would always be in a state where
half of the network is unable to communicate with the other half of the
network, or more likely we would be stuck with the initial set of
features because nobody would want to be the first ones to become
incompatible with everyone else.</p>
<p>But Moxie is right. We could move <strong>much</strong> faster if we didn’t care about
interoperability, software diversity, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And that is the approach Signal is taking.</p>
<h2 id="product-or-protocol">Product or protocol?</h2>
<p>It’s clear that there are trade-offs to be made here. Signal’s
product-led development excludes others from participating in the Signal
network. But it allows them to remain agile, and implement new features
as fast as they can write and ship code.</p>
<p>I put together some of the trade-offs into the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Building an ecosystem</th>
<th>Building a product</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus on protocol</td>
<td>Focus on implementation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly documentation</td>
<td>Mostly code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-project collaboration</td>
<td>Single project/team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building for developers</td>
<td>Building for end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slow evolution</td>
<td>Evolves as fast as you want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve diversity</td>
<td>Achieve a monoculture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robust</td>
<td>Single point of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think that Signal’s approach is laudable for the number of people that
they have helped divert from data-mining platforms, and helping to remind
people that surveillance capitalism isn’t the only way to do things.</p>
<p>They’ve built a good user-friendly product, and they have done it with
security and privacy at its heart.</p>
<p>But we have to aspire to more than this. Signal is a centralized, closed
system. That means to communicate with your contacts who use Signal, you
must also consent to their terms, their software, their US jurisdiction.
You have to be okay with their servers being hosted with large cloud
providers such as Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>But one thing the past has shown us is that things change. Technologies
evolve, business leaders come and go, motives adjust. Signal today may
be as benign as WhatsApp before its acquisition by Facebook. But …</p></div></div>

                                    <p>Most of the visual cortex studies I’ve read have been about mammalian vision. But mammals are not the only organisms with cortex, or at least tissue resembling cortex. This paper explores <em>turtle</em> visual cortex, in an area known as dCx. This dorsal region plays the role of the turtle primary vision center — as close as you can find to the homolog of human V1.</p>

<p>But unlike V1, Fournier &amp; Müller et al confirm the existing knowledge that while dCx receives direct inputs from LGN, its layout is <em>not</em> retinotopic. They expand upon this understanding by recording from both individual cells (with electrophysiological recording) and populations of cells. They show that, aside from some slight preferences of caudal dCx for rostral LGN inputs (and vice versa), dCx doesn’t have any clear layout pattern.</p>

<p>This is interesting because the simple, three-layer cortex of a reptile is a much simpler substrate for understanding vision than the complex, deep cortex of mammals. What, if not “pixel-level” information, is dCx responding to?</p>

<p>While the turtles watched movies, the researchers watched the turtles. In particular, they noticed that certain cells of dCx responded to <em>scene-level</em> stimuli: When there was a cut, or the film started or stopped, there was a burst of activity. When the same stimulus was played repeatedly, these responses died away.</p>

<p>This style of scene-level parsing in mammals is reserved for “later”, down-stream brain areas. Does this mean that turtles are using dCx as both early signal processing as well as higher-level object recognition and interpretation? If so, does this mean that mammalian brains, with discrete areas for low-level and high-level vision, evolved from an earlier system where all of these tasks were colocated?</p>

<p>Debian is a rock solid GNU/Linux distribution with more than 30,000 packages available in its official repositories. Debian is suitable for servers, workstations, mobile devices and embedded systems.</p>
<p>Debian has a simple and clean installation system which allows installing Debian with little effort as long as the number of installations to be executed is minimal, but as this number grows the installation procedure becomes cumbersome and tedious (Please note that during the installation process it is necessary to answer configuration questions and package selection), for example if we want to install Debian in a lab that has 15 workstations, we need to repeat this process 15 times, which is possible , but if we want to deploy Debian in mass, for example 100, 200, 500 or 1000 installations, it is no longer feasible, this is the reason why the Debian developers have created a system that allows automatic or unattended installations starting from a configuration file (preseed).</p>
<p>There are three methods that can be used to execute an unattended installation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding the preseed file to the installer’s <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initrd.gz</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed#Adding_the_preseed_file_to_the_installer.27s_initrd.gz">link</a></li>
<li>Add the file boot parameter to the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ManipulatingISOs#remaster">ISO image</a></li>
<li>Load the preseed.cfg file from the network

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post we’re going to use method 1 for unattended installation starting from <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso">DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso</a></p>
<h2 id="dowload-debian-image">1. Dowload Debian image</h2>
<p>We will download the “net-install” image that allows a minimal installation, an internet connection is needed since the files are downloaded from Debian repositories.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -LO# https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso
</code></pre>
<p>Recommended reading: <a href="https://www.librebyte.net/en/internet-browsers/as-download-files-using-curl/">How to download files using curl</a></p>
<h2 id="install-xorriso">2. Install xorriso</h2>
<p><strong>xorriso</strong> allows  to extract files from an ISO image and dump into the file system</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt -y install xorriso
</code></pre>

<p>With the following command we put the files contained in the “net-install” image into the file system under the isofiles DIR if the isofiles DIR does not exist, xorriso creates it automatically.</p>
<pre><code>$ xorriso -osirrox on -indev debian-10.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso  -extract / isofiles/
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dowload-a-base-preseed">4. Dowload a base preseed</h2>
<p>A basic template is available from Debian site which serves as a starting point for our unattended installation system.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -#L https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/example-preseed.txt -o preseed.cfg
</code></pre>

<h2 id="modify-preseed-template-according-our-needs">5. Modify preseed template according our needs</h2>
<h3 id="setting-the-locale">5.1. Setting the locale</h3>
<p>Set operating system language to English, UTF-8 encoding and locale settings (date, currencies) to English U.S.</p>
<pre><code>d-i debian-installer/language string en
d-i debian-installer/country string US
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US.UTF-8
</code></pre>
<h3 id="setting-the-timezone">5.2. Setting the timezone</h3>
<p>Set the hardware clock to UTC and set the timezone to America/New_York (we can use any value found on <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo/</code>) and use <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> for time synchronization.</p>
<pre><code>d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true
d-i time/zone string America/New_York
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true

<h3 id="configure-the-keyboard">5.3.  Configure the keyboard</h3>
<p>Set the keyboard to US.</p>
<pre><code>d-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap select us
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-the-network">5.4. Configure the network</h3>
<p>With the following configuration the installation system will try to configure the network automatically, set the hostname to debian10, set localdomain as domain name and use the <code>http.us.debian.org</code> as  mirror it is also possible to specify a proxy which in this case is empty.</p>
<pre><code>d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string debian10
d-i netcfg/get_domain string localdomain
# Avoid to show WEP dialog
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string
d-i mirror/country string manual
d-i mirror/http/hostname string http.us.debian.org
d-i mirror/http/directory string /debian
d-i mirror/http/proxy string
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-users">5.5. Configure users</h3>
<p>We disable the the root user authentication user, instead we will use <code>sudo</code> with a standard user with encrypted password.</p>
<pre><code>d-i passwd/root-login boolean false
d-i passwd/user-fullname string Ponga Aqui el nombre completo del usuario a crear
d-i passwd/username string nombre_de_usuario
d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password Ponga aqui la contraseña encryptada
</code></pre>
<p>To encrypt the password you can execute the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 <span>-</span>c <span>'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("mipass", crypt.METHOD_SHA512))'</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="partitioning">5.6. Partitioning</h3>
<p>We’re going to use <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager">LVM</a> as partition method, <strong>any old partition will be removed</strong>, the selected partition scheme is <code>atomic</code> that means use the the entire hard disk for a single partition, another options are: home (living in its own partition) and multi (separate partitions for /home, /var, /tmp).</p>
<pre><code>d-i partman-auto/method string lvm
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max
</code></pre>
<p>Avoid that partman asks for  confirmation to continue with the partition process.</p>
<pre><code>d-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
d-i partman/confirm boolean true
d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true
</code></pre>
<h3 id="packages-selection">5.7. Packages selection</h3>
<p>In addition to the base system, install an <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> server.</p>

A few years ago we worked with Leif Segerstam, a composer/conductor
from Finland. He had a remarkably creative way of using the English
language, and as usual, I started writing my favourite quotes in our music.
After a few days, I learned that several other members of the
orchestra were doing the same thing.  This is a compilation of our
efforts. 
<p>
Unlike the collected quotations of another famous conductor, these
aren't just the fractured phrases of someone who speaks English as
a second language - we have before us a record of the creative mind
of a kaleidescopic flexator electrifically fluxating new meaning into
a tired old language.

<!-- make the list of quotations double spaced -->


</p><ul>
<li>Could we have a relativity normal beginning?
</li><li>Take ``La Forza Del Destino'' and half it.
</li><li>I want the music more traumatised.
</li><li>Like an old time Western locomotive we can get the organity of the puffing.

</li><li>The old quarter note becomes very freshly enough the new quarter note.
</li><li>You could take a speed of 33 metronome, or 22.
</li><li>A dividing 50 percent reaction tempo-wise.
</li><li>The quintuplet should be freshly and rudely the same as the triplet.
</li><li>I am in 76 of this here.
</li><li>Still together, conductified.
</li><li>Could I have something which is close to that which is underneath the pencil?
</li><li>The atmospheric things must have a millimetre to do with the speed.
</li><li>The winds can rehearse the length of the teedle-eedle-boom.
</li><li>Something is satelliting out of the control of the beated music.
