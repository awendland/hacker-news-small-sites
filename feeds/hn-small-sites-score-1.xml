<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Two years ago when we completed version 1 of The Classics of Science Fiction Short Story list I <a href="https://auxiliarymemory.com/2018/08/18/the-mathematics-of-buying-science-fiction-anthologies/">proposed a math challenge</a>. Version 1 came up with 275 stories. I asked if there was any mathematically way to decide what were the fewest anthologies that contained all 275 stories using ISFDB.org as a reference database. Version 1 was generated using .csv files. Since then we updated the process to a database for version 2 of the list, which produced 101 stories — we believe that was a more practical reading list.</p>
<p>A science fiction fan could read the entire list over the summer by reading one story a day, or in a year by reading one story every three days, but where would they get the 101 science fiction short stories? It might be possible to track down many stories on the internet, but what if people wanted to read them in a printed book? What would be the minimum number of anthologies to buy to get all the stories? That seem like an fascinating mathematical problem to me.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://szymonszott.github.io/">Szymon Szott</a> just <a href="https://github.com/SzymonSzott/science-fiction-anthology-problem">came up with a solution</a> using version 2 of the list. The second link goes to GitHub for Szymon’s Python code and documentation. The first link goes to his bio. Even if you can’t read the programming code you should <a href="https://github.com/SzymonSzott/science-fiction-anthology-problem/blob/master/classics_sf.ipynb">visit this page</a> that explains his solution. Szymon was able to come up with 22 anthologies that collected the 101 stories on the v. 2 of <a href="https://csfquery.com/SearchResult?mincite=8&amp;category=story&amp;sortby=7&amp;list=1">The Classics of Science Fiction Short Stories</a> list.</p>
<p>The photo above pictures eight anthologies that get 81 stories of the version 2 list. Of course, those eight anthologies gets you a lot more than 81 stories. I tried to figure out the solution myself by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BcnkixicU-NtvTrBfwX03vqGSAF5yAorMQTnn-Ytq1M/edit?usp=sharing">using a spreadsheet</a> and the best I could do was find fifteen anthologies to cover 81 stories, and then gave up. I figured my eyeballing method might have gotten me to 30-35 anthologies.</p>
<p>Here’s what Szymon says about the project:</p>
<pre>As a fan of science fiction and a compulsive completionist, Worlds Without End is one of my favorite sites on the Internet. It was there that I learned about Jim and Mike's work on the list of classic science fiction novels which I've been eagerly following. When the list of classic science fiction short stories was announced and Jim blogged about <a href="https://auxiliarymemory.com/2018/08/18/the-mathematics-of-buying-science-fiction-anthologies/">The Mathematics of Buying Science Fiction Anthologies</a>, I knew this was an interesting problem to solve. But it wasn't until I started dabbling in Python that I realized that, along with the 2020 travel-restricted summer holidays, I now had the tools to start chipping away at this. Creating a story-to-anthology mapping using data from the Internet Speculative Fiction Database didn't take too long, but the underlying mathematical problem was harder than I initially thought: it turned out that a brute-force approach of checking all possible combinations is unfeasible. Still, the heuristic used has given us a solution which I'm satisfied with and I don't think there exists a much better global solution. I was most surprised that the Science Fiction Hall of Fame series did not make the list (as I've already read volume one). Thank you Jim for this challenge! Now, all this coding was fun, but it's time to get back to reading: Sense of Wonder is next!</pre>
<p>This isn’t an easy problem. Szymon had to screenscrape the table of contents from 290 anthologies from ISFDB.org, which contained one or more of the 101 stories. Just look at <a href="https://github.com/SzymonSzott/science-fiction-anthology-problem/blob/master/main.csv">this listing</a> to see how often each of these stories was reprinted. Towards the end of his programming loops, he had to use eight anthologies to cover eight stories. If all those singletons had been in one anthology, Szymon’s finally anthology list would have been 15. Most of those singletons were newer stories and there haven’t been enough time for them to be collected into a retrospective anthology. One new anthology could shorten Szymon’s final list.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to Part 2 of my shameless attempt at explaining Docker to beginners. I struggled so you don't have to!</p>
<p>In last week's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.antoniolofiego.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-containers-a-foolproof-hands-on-docker-tutorial-part-1-ckdc4tni0031759s14z0pdd2j">article</a> we covered what Docker is, some of its jargon, and why it outperforms VMs in many use cases in today's typical software development lifecycle. This week we'll go deeper into running Docker on our machines, all while figuring out the most interesting and useful underlying technicalities.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3aGZA6WLI9Jde/giphy.gif" alt="Let's go!"></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-docker">Getting started with Docker</h2>
<p>If you don't have Docker installed on your machine, head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker Download page</a> to get the version that will work on your system.</p>
<p>The Linux version is the easiest to install, given that Docker is built off of Linux utilities. On Mac and Windows, on the other hand, there are two main ways of using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>
The newer and recommended version of Docker. It is a native solution that works directly along with your OS's processes, so we are free to interface with Docker with your favorite terminal and your favorite IDE/text editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a>
This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pulling fs layer
0e03bdcc26d7: Verifying Checksum
0e03bdcc26d7: Download complete
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

</code></pre>
<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596760605560/zssexvySE.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Repo structure"></p>
<p>We know how to pull and run simple images! We just scratched the Docker surface, however. Are you ready to go to the next level?</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/570/0*y8AuUHSoTGRqX40h.jpeg" alt="We need to go deeper!"></p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.013MB
Step 1/6 : FROM node:11-alpine

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Xbox Series X Still Launching November</h2><p>The Xbox Series X is still on track to launch this November. I expect this will be a soft launch, with a range of third party games such as <i>Madden 21</i>, <i>Fifa 21</i>, <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, <i>Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War</i>, <i>NBA 2K21,&nbsp;Assassin's Creed: Valhalla </i>and <i>Watch Dogs Legion</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft will heavily emphasize backwards compatibility on the console, noting the thousands of games that can be played on it. I wouldn't be surprised if it also focused on the 4K/120fps ability, showcasing games that achieve this to help sell the console.&nbsp;</p><h2>PlayStation 5 To Own November?</h2><p>The biggest beneficiary of the delay is Sony. The PlayStation 5 has exclusive games, a clear line-up and vision of where it wants to go. All Sony has to do is announce the price and launch date and watch the PlayStation 5 fly off the shelves this winter.&nbsp;</p><p>As I wrote before, there are no major games that will take advantage of the system's power until next year. But the delay gives Sony a head-start in the next generation. There will be a void and the absence of <i>Halo Infinite</i> could persuade some Xbox gamers to jump ship.</p><h2>Heads To Roll At 343 Industries</h2><p>One of the biggest consequences of the delay could be a shake up at 343. The studio has had over five years since the release of <i>Halo 5: Guardians</i>&nbsp;to get this ready. That would have been plenty of time to get the game ready to be shipped for a November 2020 launch. Something has clearly gone wrong there and I would expect Phil Spencer to investigate fully and make organisational changes as needed to right the ship. Will Bonnie Ross go? Who knows.</p><h2>Microsoft Needs To Get This Right</h2><p>After the disastrous current gen, Microsoft <b>needs</b> to get the next generation right. It cannot afford any slip-ups, nor can it afford to be complacent and rely on the success of Game Pass Ultimate to drive revenue for the Xbox division.&nbsp;</p><p>If I were management at Microsoft and wanted to make a dent, I would undercut the PlayStation 5 and bundle Game Pass Ultimate (for 3 months) with it. Then I would go around making deals with every third party publisher and ensure the system has exclusive DLC/content and new games. Microsoft needs to be aggressive.</p><p>Failure to do so could mean this would be the last console generation it participates in. I expect there are a few higher-ups at Microsoft who would be very happy at that possibility. They are probably thinking 'we are a software company, what are we doing making consoles?'.&nbsp;</p><p>We, as gamers, though, need Microsoft to succeed. Competition is healthy, so we need the Xbox Series X to do well.</p><h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2><p>Halo Infinite's delay is unfortunate. I hope 343 uses the time to make a better game and improve on its foundations, creating a game that will give PlayStation a run for its money. I look forward to seeing the results next year.&nbsp;</p><div><p>***</p><p>If you want to save money on games, take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kinguin.net/cjaffiliate/index/index/ref/cj/?URL=https://deal.kinguin.net&amp;skimoffer=1049864" target="_blank">Kinguin</a></p><p>They have a great Summer sale on at the moment.&nbsp;Good Deals for a Good Week.

<![CDATA[Configure Your Sockets with URIs]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Everybody knows Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. As its name suggests, it’s a way to identify a resource (for instance a file or a phone number).
It is often confused with Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is actually a form of URI. A URL is <em>a compact string representation for a resource available via the Internet</em><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Today I want to share with you the way I define another type of resources: network sockets.
<!--more-->
Everybody knows what a network socket is, right ?</p>

<p>The socket families I often use are <code>inet</code>, <code>inet6</code> and <code>unix</code>. But there are much more types of endpoints: <code>ipx</code>, <code>bluetooth</code>,…</p>

<p>To configure the sockets my services or APIs have to bind, I’m now using URIs! For instance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inet://127.0.0.1:80?reuseaddr=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example I basically create a socket IPv4 on address <code>127.0.0.1</code> and port <code>80</code> with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> option enabled.</p>

<p><strong>PRO:</strong> It might be specified in any configuration file because it’s basically just a string. You don’t need any complex structure to define socket type or options.</p>

<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

<p>The URI <em>scheme</em> defines which socket family I have to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>inet</em> for IPv4 sockets</li>
  <li><em>inet6</em> for IPv6 sockets</li>
  <li><em>unix</em> for Unix sockets</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully these schemes are not (yet) registered at IANA<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The URI’s <em>authority</em> and <em>path</em> depend on the family used. Query arguments are used to configure options of the socket. They also depend on the family used.</p>

<h4 id="ipv4-sockets">IPv4 sockets</h4>

<p>For <em>inet</em> family the authority is mandatory. It contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>hostname</em> (optional):
    <ul>
      <li>either a IPv4, for instance <code>127.0.0.1</code></li>
      <li>or a hostname which needs to be resolved as a IPv4 address</li>
      <li>if not specified, the default value is <code>0.0.0.0</code>: it binds on all IPv4 addresses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the <em>port</em> (mandatory)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>path</em> is not used in this case, it remains empty.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>inet://127.0.0.1:8080</code> binds on address <code>127.0.0.1</code> and port <code>8080</code>, easy!</li>
  <li><code>inet://example.com:5432</code> resolves <code>example.com</code> to an IPv4 and binds on port <code>5432</code></li>
  <li><code>inet://:80?reuseaddr=true</code> listen on port <code>80</code> and accept connections on any IPv4 of the system (<code>0.0.0.0</code>) even if there are remaining connections in <code>TIME_WAIT</code></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ipv6-sockets">IPv6 sockets</h4>

<p>Idem than <code>inet</code> but for IPv6 and with URI scheme <code>inet6</code>. Some query argments might defer.</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering why I use <code>inet</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>inet6</code>. Indeed I could use an IPv6 address with the <code>inet</code> scheme. However it doesn’t work with domain name resolution. For instance <code>inet://localhost:80</code> will bind on IPv4 address <code>127.0.0.1</code> while <code>inet6://localhost:80</code> will bind on IPv6 address <code>::1</code>.</p>

<h4 id="unix-sockets">Unix sockets</h4>

<p><em>Authority</em> part is not used for <em>unix</em> family. However the path is used like a <code>file:/</code> URI. It defines the path of the unix socket.</p>

<p>For instance: <code>unix:///var/run/my-socket.sock</code></p>

<h3 id="specification--implementation">Specification &amp; implementation</h3>

<p>I don’t think there is already a specification or RFC which tackle this idea.</p>

<p>I guess this trick is already used in <del>some</del> many implementations. To be honnest I didn’t look a lot. But feel free to share your godsend!</p>

These categories are "Do It Yourself (DIY)," "Do It With Me (DIWM)," and "Do It For Me (DIFM)." For each provider we list, your money is protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means you could get your money back up to £85,000 if any of the companies goes bust.

It would help if you have clear goals, know your risk appetite and understand how to build a portfolio.</p><p>When you invest in a fund, please note the fund manager will add various charges within the fund. We haven't included any fund management fees here, just platform and dealing fees. If you would like a rough idea of how fund management fees could impact the total amount you pay to a platform, have a look at the 'Do It With Me' and 'Do It For Me' tabs.

<p>Writing clean, Pythonic code is all about making it as understandable, yet concise, as possible.
This is the third part of a series on Python refactorings, based on those that can be done
automatically by <a href="https://sourcery.ai/">Sourcery</a>. Catch the first part <a href="https://sourcery.ai/blog/explaining-refactorings-1/">here</a>, and
the second part <a href="https://sourcery.ai/blog/explaining-refactorings-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The focus of this series is on why these changes are good ideas, not just on how to do them.</p>
<h2>1. Add guard clause</h2>
<p>Deeply nested functions can be very difficult to understand. As you read them you
have to remember the conditions that hold for each level of nesting. This can be even
more difficult in Python, given that there are no brackets to help define conditional
blocks. An easy way to reduce nesting is to convert conditionals into guard clauses.</p>
<p>As an example let's look at this function:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        current_fashion <span>=</span> FASHION_API<span>.</span>get_fashion<span>(</span>FASHION_TYPE<span>.</span>HAT<span>)</span>
        weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
            <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> is_stylish
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is quite hard to parse, given the two layers of nesting. When I get to the
<code>else</code> at the bottom I need to flick back and forth a bit between that and the
<code>if</code> test at the top before I've understood what's going on. This <code>if</code>
condition is a check for an edge case, where something that isn't a hat is
passed in. Since we just return <code>False</code> here it's a perfect place to
introduce a guard clause:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> is_stylish</code></pre></div>
<p>We add a guard clause by inverting the condition and returning immediately.
The edge case is now taken care of at the start of the function and I don't have to
worry about it any more. </p>
<p>Having reduced the level of nesting, the rest of the function is now easier to read.
Whether to add a guard clause is sometimes subjective. For really short functions it
may not be worth doing. Where functions are longer or more complex it can often be
a useful tool.</p>
<h2>2. Swap if/else to remove empty if body</h2>
<p>One pattern we sometimes see is a conditional where nothing happens in the main body,
and all of the action is in the <code>else</code> clause.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> location <span>==</span> OUTSIDE<span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    take_off_hat<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case we can make the code shorter and more concise by swapping the main body
and the <code>else</code> around. We have to make sure to invert the conditional, then the logic
from the <code>else</code> clause moves into the main body.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> location <span>!=</span> OUTSIDE<span>:</span>
   take_off_hat<span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
   <span>pass</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We then have an <code>else</code> clause which does nothing, so we can remove it.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> location <span>!=</span> OUTSIDE<span>:</span>
    take_off_hat<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is easier to read, and the intent of the conditional is clearer. When reading
the code I don't have to mentally invert it to understand it, since that has been done for me.</p>
<h2>3. Merge append into list declaration</h2>
<p>When declaring a list and filling it up with values one way that can come naturally
is to declare it as empty and then append to it.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_i_own <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
hats_i_own<span>.</span>append<span>(</span><span>'panama'</span><span>)</span>
hats_i_own<span>.</span>append<span>(</span><span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>)</span>
hats_i_own<span>.</span>append<span>(</span><span>'bowler'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can be done in place, shortening the code and making the intent more explicit.
Now I just need to glance at one line to see that I'm filling a variable with hats,
rather than four.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_i_own <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'panama'</span><span>,</span> <span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>,</span> <span>'bowler'</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Doing it this way is also slightly more performant since it avoids the function calls to <code>append</code>.
The same holds true for filling up other collection types like sets and dictionaries.</p>
<h2>4. Move assignments closer to their usage</h2>
<p>The scope of local variables should always be as tightly defined as possible and
practicable.</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to keep the variable in your working memory through the parts of
the function where it's not needed. This cuts down on the cognitive load of
understanding your code.</li>
<li>If code is in coherent blocks where variables are declared and used together, it
makes it easier to split functions apart, which can lead to shorter, easier to
understand methods.</li>
<li>If variables are declared far from their usage, they can become stranded. If the
code where they are used is later changed or removed unused variables can be left
sitting around, complicating the code unnecessarily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take another look at the earlier example.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> is_stylish</code></pre></div>
<p>Here the <code>is_stylish</code> variable isn't actually needed if the weather is rainy.
It could be moved inside the <code>else</code> clause. This means we can also move the
<code>current_fashion</code> variable, which is only used here.
You do need to check that these variables aren't used
later in the function, which is easier if functions are kept short and sweet.</p>
<p>Moving the assignment to <code>current_fashion</code> also avoids a function call when the
weather is raining, which could lead to a performance improvement if it's an expensive call. </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> is_stylish</code></pre></div>
<p>We could actually then go one step further and inline the <code>is_stylish</code> variable.
This shows how small refactorings can often build on one another and lead to further
improvements.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>5. Use items() to directly unpack dictionary values</h2>
<p>When iterating over a dictionary a good tip is that you can use <code>items()</code> to let
you access the keys and values at the same time. This lets you transform this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_by_colour <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'blue'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'panama'</span><span>,</span> <span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> hat_colour <span>in</span> hats_by_colour<span>:</span>
    hats <span>=</span> hats_by_colour<span>[</span>hat_colour<span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> hat_colour <span>in</span> self<span>.</span>favourite_colours<span>:</span>
        think_about_wearing<span>(</span>hats<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>into this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_by_colour <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'blue'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'panama'</span><span>,</span> <span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> hat_colour<span>,</span> hats <span>in</span> hats_by_colour<span>.</span>items<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> hat_colour <span>in</span> self<span>.</span>favourite_colours<span>:</span>
        think_about_wearing<span>(</span>hats<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This saves us the line that we used to assign to <code>hats</code>, incorporating it into the for loop.
The code now reads more naturally, with a touch less duplication.</p>
<h2>6. Simplify sequence comparison</h2>
<p>Something we often do is check whether a list or sequence has elements before we try
and do something with it.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>list_of_hats<span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
    hat_to_wear <span>=</span> choose_hat<span>(</span>list_of_hats<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A Pythonic way of doing this is just to use the fact that Python lists and sequences evaluate
to <code>True</code> if they have elements, and <code>False</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>This means we can write the above code more simply as: </p>

<p>Doing it this way is a convention, set out in Python's <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> style guide.
Once you've gotten used to doing it this way it does make the code slightly easier to read and
a bit less cluttered.</p>

<p>As mentioned, each of these is a refactoring that <a href="https://sourcery.ai/">Sourcery</a> can automatically perform for you.
We're planning on expanding this blog series out and linking them in as additional documentation,
with the aim of turning Sourcery into a great resource for learning how to improve your Python skills.

Providing full Vim emulation was not originally a goal of ModalEdit. The idea of
the extension is to provide an engine that allows the user to <a href="https://johtela.github.io/vscode-modaledit/docs/README.html#configuration">map any key
combination to any command provided by VS Code</a>.
However, most users equate modal editing with Vim and are familiar with its
default keybindings. Vim users really love the powerful key sequences that
combine editing operations with cursor motions or text ranges.</p>
<p>ModalEdit has also evolved by taking inspiration from Vim. Many capabilities
were added with the motive to enable some Vim feature that was previously not
possible to implement. With version 2.0 ModalEdit's functionality is now
extensive enough to build a semi-complete Vim emulation. So, here we go...</p>
<p>Adding Vim keybindings as optional presets serves two purposes: it lowers the
barrier to entry for Vim users who don't want to spend the time defining
bindings from ground up. Secondly, Vim presets serve as an example to show
how you can build sophisticated command sequences using the machinery provided
by ModalEdit.</p>
<p><img src="https://johtela.github.io/vscode-modaledit/docs/images/import-preset.png" alt="importing presets" width="553" height="94">
If you are not interested on how the Vim keybindings are implemented and just
want to use them, you can skip this discussion. Just import the presets by
pressing <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>Shift</key>+<key>P</key> and running command
<strong>ModalEdit: Import preset keybindings</strong>. You will be presented a choice to
import either Vim bindings or any presets that you have created yourself. If
you are planning to customize the bindings, or create Vim-style commands from
scratch, this document gives you pointers how to go about with that.</p>
<h2 id="game-plan">Game Plan</h2>
<p>We start with basic motion commands which are mostly straightforward to
implement. Motions have two modes of operation: normal mode (moving cursor), and
visual mode (extending selection). We make sure all motions work correctly in
both modes. This allows us to reuse these keybindings when implementing more
advanced operations. Our goal is to avoid repetition by building complex
sequences from primitive commands.</p>
<p>In Vim, there are multiple key sequences for a same operation. For example,
you can convert a paragraph upper case by typing
<key>g</key><key>U</key><key>i</key><key>p</key>. You can perform the same
operation using visual mode by typing <key>v</key><key>i</key><key>p</key><key>U</key>.
The trick we use is to convert key sequences that operate on character, word,
line, paragraph, etc. to analagous key sequences that use visual mode. We can
implement all the editing commands just to work on active selection and reuse
these commands with the other key combinations. Consequently, command definition
becomes a string mapping problem. Since we can use JavaScript to expressions to
do string manipulation, these mappings are easy to formulate.</p>

<pre><code>{
    <span>"keybindings"</span>: {

<p>Cursor can be advanced in a file with with enter and space. These are not
technically motion commands but included for compatibility.</p>

<p>Move cursor up/down/left/right.</p>

<pre><code>        "h": "cursorLeft",
        "j": "cursorDown",
        "k": "cursorUp",
        "l": "cursorRight",
</code></pre>
<p>Move to first/last character on line. These work also in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "0": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineStart', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "$": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineEnd', select: __selecting }"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Move to first/last non-blank character on line. Also these ones use the
<code>__selecting</code> flag to check whether we are in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "^": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineFirstNonWhitespaceCharacter', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "g": {
            "_": {
                "command": "cursorMove",
                "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineLastNonWhitespaceCharacter', select: __selecting }"
            },
</code></pre>
<p>Moving to the beginning of file is defined as a conditional command to make
it work in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>            "g": {
                "condition": "__selecting",
                "true": "cursorTopSelect",
                "false": "cursorTop"
            },
</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-commands-starting-with-key-g-key">Other Commands Starting with <key>g</key></h2>
<p>Commands starting with <key>g</key> key are bit inconsistent in Vim. Some of
them are basic motion commands, such as <key>g</key><key>_</key> and
<key>g</key><key>g</key>, some are editing commands like <key>g</key><key>J</key>
and <key>g</key><key>U</key>, and some switch between tabs 🤷‍♂️. Since we have to
define all bindings with the same prefix in same place, we take a detour and add
these commands before continuing with rest of the motion commands.</p>
<div>

</div><p>Joining lines without space is done by deleting a character after the join
command.</p>

<pre><code>            "J": [
                "editor.action.joinLines",
                "deleteRight"
            ],
</code></pre>
<p>The lower/uppercase transition works with any motion, but since we have not
defined all of them yet, we explain the command structure
<a href="#editing-with-motions">later in the document</a>.
The structure we use here is exactly the same as with <key>d</key> command, for
example.</p>

<p><key>g</key><key>t</key> and <key>g</key><key>T</key> switch to next/previous

            "T": "workbench.action.previousEditor"
        },
</code></pre>
<h2 id="rest-of-the-motion-commands">Rest of the Motion Commands</h2>
<p>Now we can complete the list of basic motion commands. This one movest the
cursor at the end of the file and selects the range, if visual mode is on.</p>

<pre><code>        "G": {
            "condition": "__selecting",
            "true": "cursorBottomSelect",
            "false": "cursorBottom"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>The logic of separating words is bit different in VS Code and Vim, so we will
not try to imitate Vim behavior here. These keys are mapped to the most similar
motion available. The <key>W</key> and <key>B</key> commands skip separator
characters, and move to the start of the next/previous alphanumeric word.</p>

<pre><code>        "w": "cursorWordStartRight",
        "e": "cursorWordEndRight",
        "b": "cursorWordStartLeft",
        "W": {
            "command": "cursorWordStartRight",
            "repeat": "__char.match(/\\W/)"
        },
        "B": {
            "command": "cursorWordStartLeft",
            "repeat": "__char.match(/\\W/)"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Moving cursor to the top, middle, and bottom of the screen is mapped to
<key>H</key> (high), <key>M</key> (middle), and <key>L</key> (low) keys. These
mappings also work in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "H": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortTop', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "M": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortCenter', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "L": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortBottom', select: __selecting }"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Move to matching bracket command is somewhat challenging to implement
consistently in VS Code. This is due to the problem that there are no commands
that do exactly what Vim's motions do. In normal mode we call the
<code>jumpToBracket</code> command which works if the cursor is on top of a bracket, but
does not allow for the selection to be extended. In visual mode we use the
<code>smartSelect.expand</code> command instead to extend the selection to whatever
syntactic scope is above the current selection. In many cases, it is more useful
motion than jumping to a matching bracket, but using it means that we are
diverging from Vim's …</p></div></div>

          <div>
            

<p>Hey everyone, <br>

Today is a big day for NeuralCam. We have three announcements to make: some news about NeuralCam as a company, a major update for our NightMode app and a brand new <strong>Smart Camera app.</strong>
</p><br>
<h3>
NeuralCam - building Smart Camera Apps
</h3>
<div><p>Let’s start by talking a bit about cameras and AI. </p><p>

At NeuralCam, we think that one of the biggest leaps in technology over the past years has been the advances Deep Learning brought in the area of Computer Vision. It gives computers the ability to see - to understand patterns, images and video similarly to how people do.
 </p></div>



<p>Ultimately, we think this technology will give birth to a new category of cameras - <b>Smart Cameras</b> - that will have a profound impact on every activity that involves capturing and processing images.
</p>

<p>We see this change similar to the transformation from classic cellular phones to the modern smartphone we witnessed 10 years ago. We believe that martphones themselves seem to be the ideal smart camera platform: they have high quality cameras and enough processing power to run modern AI algorithms on-device.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartcameras.png">
</p>

<p>So, we can all have our own personal smart cameras in our pockets, all that’s needed is the right ML software. This ML software is what we call Smart Camera Apps, and these are the type of apps we’re building at NeuralCam.
</p>

<p>Whenever we see a visual task we might say “there’s a Smart Cam App for that”. We’ve been doing a lot of research and prototyping and we’re more and more confident that smart camera apps will play a key role in every industry, from Education through Healthcare to Entertainment, and we can’t wait to contribute something in each of these areas.

</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartapps.png">
</p>

<p>However, the first category that is naturally most likely to change is almost analogous to the camera itself: photography and videography. Thus, this is what we’ve decided to start with, building AI powered Photo &amp; Video apps over the next few years. 
</p>

<p>Our first smart photo app we’ve launched is the NeuralCam NightMode app, which brought Night Mode to all iPhones and all iPhone camera lenses. But, NeuralCam is more than the Night Mode app. We think of NeuralCam as a range of smart camera apps in different categories for various use cases. 
</p>



<p>So, one of the things we did is update our brand to reflect this change. This is the first thing we’d like to show you today, a fresh NeuralCam: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nclogo.png"></p>

<p>And this is the new NeuralCam NightMode:</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NightModeLogo.png">
<br>
</p>
<p>Ok, so that’s the story of NeuralCam - the company. The second thing we want to show you is an update to our NightMode app. 

</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam NightMode</h3>

<p>We <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/neuralcam" target="_blank">launched</a> our first smart camera app, NeuralCam NightMode, about a year ago, last August. It brought NightMode to the iPhone and the response from the users and critics <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/30/iphone-camera-app-for-night-shots/" target="_blank">was amazing.</a>
</p>

<p>We’ve been <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/08/28/neuralcam-night-photo-app-brings-ai-powered-low-light-mode-to-iphones/" target="_blank">covered</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/25/iphone-11-pro-camera-review-features-with-night-mode-app/" target="_blank">in many</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/30/iphone-11-release-date-soon-specs-camera-night-mode/" target="_blank">major</a> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2019/08/29/this-app-uses-ai-to-add-a-pixel-style-night-photography-mode-to-your-iphone/" target="_blank">press</a> <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/neuralcam-iphone-app-uses-ai-to-capture-bright-images-at-night-26588672/" target="_blank">publications</a>, got lots of love letters from users, and been recognized as the best NightMode app out there. 
</p>
<p>While Apple has launched a built-in night mode on the iPhone 11 in the meantime, NeuralCam continues to be the NightMode solution for devices or iPhone cameras without a native NightMode - like the newly launched iPhone SE or even the UltraWide &amp; Selfie cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro. </p>
<p>Since its launch, people have used NeuralCam NightMode to take more than 10M low light photos. 
</p>

<div><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/10M.png"></p></div>

<p>Now, with a major update, we have made our NightMode app even better: we've made some major improvements to our algorithm so that it supports higher resolutions on older devices too; we’ve updated the UI to be in-line with the new NeuralCam brand and we’ve officially added iPad support.</p><p>This is how the update NeuralCam NightMode app looks like on an iPad:</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nmupdate.png">
<br>
</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam Live</h3>

<p>The popularity of video calls has exploded lately. In the current global context, most of us use video calls a lot for both getting our job done or to keep in touch with loved ones. For something used as often, we really need to have the best possible tools. 

</p>

<p>Looking at the things out there, we realized that there’s a weak link in all this video call experience, and it’s the webcams. </p><p>We’ve got laptop webcams (quite bad), dedicated webcams (a bit better) or apps that let you use your iPhone as a webcam (best quality). However, these products really only differ from one another in the resolution of the video they provide. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/webcams.png">
<br>
</p>

<p> The problem with webcams is that they’re mostly the same as they were 10 years ago, they do the same thing only slightly better. In the meantime, this cool new technology called Deep Learning came along which could add a whole new dimension to webcams and possibly change the whole video call experience - but nobody uses it. 

</p>

<p>
It turns out that one of the main reasons for Deep Learning not being used with webcams is that no webcam has the processing power required to run the required ML algorithms. Except there is one device which, when converted to a webcam, could do all this: the iPhone in our pocket.
</p>

<p>It’s got one of the best cameras in the smartphone industry and with its fast processors and dedicated machine learning hardware, it is capable of running even video processing machine learning algorithms in real-time. It just needs the right SmartCam App software to do all this. 
  </p><p>We've built this software - we call it NeuralCam Live and it turns the iPhone into the <strong>world’s smartest webcam.</strong>
  </p>
<div><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/LiveLogo.png"></p></div>







<p>
	Ok, so how are we going to do that?
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Technology</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/tech.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>First, we need the software that connects the iPhone to the laptop and makes it appear just like a regular webcam when connected through a USB cable. 
</p>

<p>This software has two modules: the first one is an iOS app that provides the webcam functionality, while the second one is a plugin that’s installed on the laptop to make the iOS app appear as a webcam. Once you install both of these components, all you have to do is select the NeuralCam Live Camera in Zoom, Google Meet or your video call platform of choice.
</p>

<p>So, that was quite easy, now comes the fun part. </p><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/engine.png">
<br>
</p>

<p> The second component we need is the machine learning software to make our smart webcam... well, smart. We call it the <b>LiveEngine</b> </p>

<p>Machine learning, as a generic technology, can help us in two ways when it comes to webcams: we can use it to recognize things in the video feed or generate new video content, improved in some way. </p><p>We’ve developed multiple machine learning modules, some proprietary, some built on top of existing CoreML models and we’ve grouped them in three different machine learning frameworks that cover both video generation and analysis: the Style Framework, the Enhance Framework and the Gesture Framework. Let’s take a quick look at each of these. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_style.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>The <b>Style Framework</b> is a deep learning-based machine learning framework that edits video similarly to a professional colorist. 
</p>
<p>Its Neural Nets were trained on images edited by hand by professionals in a range of different editing styles. The results are quite amazing, generating pro-looking videosf, very close in terms of style to the professionally edited frames it was trained on and it does all this in real-time at 30fps locally, on the user’s iPhone.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_enhance.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Enhance Framework</b> contains our set of machine learning models that can enhance a video in a bunch of different ways. </p>

<p>Our real-time video denoising and brightening models in this category achieve levels of quality and performance that are much better than traditional algorithms and make features such as video low light enhancement or face smoothing possible.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_recognition.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Recognition Framework</b> is the part of our LiveEngine that is meant to make our smart camera apps understand what they “see”. </p>

<p>It uses a combination of machine learning models provided by the iPhone SDK and adds a number of proprietary elements to detect faces, user gestures or other different patterns in the live video feed. In the app, we can use this type of technology to blur unwanted gestures or guide you to set up an ideal environment for a call.
</p>

<p>Together, all these elements form what we call the LiveEngine - the ever-evolving software module that makes NeuralCam Live a smart webcam.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NCFeats.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at the actual product. </p>
<p>The iPhone app exposes all of the functionality of the smart iPhone webcam in a simple layout, most of the features can be accessed by just tapping a button on the screen. It also shows a nice preview of the current video feed. 
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartwebcam.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>So, using all this technology, what more can a smart webcam do compared to a traditional webcam? 
</p>

<p>In terms of the outcome they provide to the user, we’ve realized that most of the AI features we’ve built fit nicely in two categories: making you look better and helping you avoid embarrassing mistakes.
</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at these features one-by-one: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/fiq.png">
<br>
</p>

<h4>Face &amp; Image Quality Meter
</h4>



<p>The Face &amp; Image Quality Meter detects the amount of face lighting, type of face position and background and displays an overall Face Image Quality score. 
</p>

<p>It helps you set up an optimal video-call environment and helps you avoid making typical mistakes, such as sitting with your back towards a bright window or in an unfavorable low angle.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/styles.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>Pro Video Styling</h4>

<p>
  
  Using the Style Framework, NeuralCam Live edits the video feed like a professional colorist would, in a range of different styles. The end-result is a more impactful look, allowing you to choose the style that best fits your mood, the type of call or the environment you're in.

</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/lowlight.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>
  
  Low-light Mode
</h4>

<p>It wouldn't be a NeuralCam product without a Night Mode, right? </p>
<p>NeuralCam Live’s Low Light Mode brightens up your video with a similar (though a lot more lightweight) technique used in our Night Mode photo app. It allows you to look good in video calls even in low light settings, a gentle light from your monitor is usually enough to provide a nice video feed. 
</p>

<p>
  
  And just in case you need to light up things even more, you can use the face-following Ring Light …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>/</p><p>/</p><p>How to Share Your Work Achievements During COVID-19</p></div></div><div><p>COVID-19 is a deadly virus. It spreads super fast and was/is impacting most of the world. Especially the economy and businesses are affected by it. Larger technology companies like Google, Microsoft are all working remotely. Most probably you find yourself also working from home. If it is a technology job or not, everyone needs to get work done. What we often forget though is to write down what we have achieved. This article should teach you how to do properly, how you will feel more grateful for your work and how you impress your colleagues, and more importantly your boss.</p><h2>Working From Home</h2><p>Most of us are forced into the Home office. It might be less than ideal to work from home because of the circumstances. Myself, a software engineer, just needs a laptop to work on. But a single laptop is less than ideal. Most of my colleagues and myself included are working on multiple screens to quickly switch up views. A lot of employees do not have a setup with multiple monitors, an ergonomic keyboard or a good chair and table at home. All of these things will arguably make you more comfortable at your workplace at home or get your productivity to the same level as in an office environment. Of course, some people might even have a better setup to work from home, but this group might be the minority. A lot of companies came up with solutions like a fund for every employee to buy equipment to work from home or offering the employees to get work equipment delivered from an office.</p><p>Another effect on people’s work-life might be other people in the household. Family, friends, or roommates might affect you in negative ways. They can be loud, might not respect your working time, and interrupt you from time to time. Of course, social contacts can also help you to not get socially isolated. There are positive sides too.</p><p>All of these points might affect your work life and with that also your performance at work. In these difficult times, it is more important than ever to keep up efficient productivity to keep your job safe and do not get unemployed. With the rise of more and more unemployment claims, it might be better to play safe and try to get the work environment into a state that will keep you productive. But how can we do this? Of course, the physical work environment might be one part like replacing a chair and table or getting additional monitors but besides that, you can work with your team on keeping up a positive spirit.</p><h2>Keeping everyone up to date at work</h2><p>People like to hear about other people’s life. This is also true for colleagues. The average employee spends 8 hours per day at work and this time will also be spent with colleagues. Not every colleague is awesome but some sympathy shown to colleagues can get you farther in your team, resulting in nice performance reviews and greater career success.</p><p>Most of the teams are connected via a chat software these days like Slack, Microsoft Teams or even Telegram. Human communication is hard via these tools but one good method to stay connected is to do a “Good Morning” routine where every employee writes “Good Morning” in different tones or with different nuances. For example, you could exchange the language to something you know, like writing “Moin Moin alle zusammen” just to bring up something different into the chat. It will also show your colleagues when you are available.</p><p>Throughout the day mostly business-related things are discussed probably within the chats and other communication programs. At the end of the day, it is also important to check-out to signal that you are not available for emergency tasks anymore. During this update, it would be also nice to write down what you have done. Your colleagues probably do not know what you have been up to the whole day and how you contributed to your team’s or company’s success. Describe things you have done, like meetings with external teams, a little bit more in detail so colleagues have an idea of your current workload and what you are dealing with. The first time you will do this review might feel weird, but it will get more common. In the first place, you should also convince your whole team to do this procedure because it will enable employees some insight of the other team members and we all want to know what kind of stuff they were dealing with, maybe we can even help them. A nice gimmick throughout this daily review is to add a random thing or fact that happened throughout the day to you or that you got to know of during the day. It will bring in some personal touch of what your colleagues and you might have experienced. An example summary could look like:</p><ul><li>Worked on the design of feature x to make it ready for development</li><li>Reached out to person y to create a blog article</li><li>…</li><li>Cooked curry today for the first time, was a failure (link image)</li></ul><p>These updates will keep your team engaged in normal life and might not even that self-harming. Everyone is doing substantial work. An important aspect of these notes is that you should mention mostly positive things and never complain about colleagues, the company, or other teams. Try to focus on positivity in the world, except in the fun fact where you can make some fun of yourself.</p><h2>Log your notes</h2><p>Now that you have made a list of work achievement notes already, you can also start tracking these in another application like getworkrecognized to be prepared for your next Performance Review. After tracking your work achievements notes for a longer time you will be able to properly<!-- --> <a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/features/preparing-for-the-self-review">prepare for your next Self-Review</a>. Having the fundamental base, which is the information of what you have actually achieved during the last period, is super important for the Performance Review. So keep your work tracked.</p><p><a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/">getworkrecognized</a> will help you to organize your notes. In the following you can find examples on how this could look like. We use the<!-- --> <a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/blog/how-klarnas-leadership-principles-work">Leadership Principles of Klarna</a> <!-- -->to tag and group the notes.</p><h2>Review Your Actions</h2><p>After writing your actions down for some time it is time to review your mood and behavior. With the actions written down, you can correlate the behavior to the impact you had. A simple task to do would be to look at a random week, check the notes you have written down, and rate yourself from 0 to 10 on how productive you have been. Review your actions, environment, and special methodologies you have used in your work from home routine work out. Seeing trends and optimizing these trends might help you with your work routine.</p><p>Another point that can be reviewed is how your team perceives this daily summary of someone’s workday. Regular surveys about the person’s mood and engagement would help to track this but in general, a simple question would be more than enough. If you see successes feel free to extend this program to a longer time during COVID-19 since it is expected that this pandemic is not ending for a long time.</p><p>With tracking all your work you are already perfectly prepared for your next Performance Review. In companies, like Klarna, a Self-Review is an essential part of the promotion process. The Self-Review consists typically of your bigger work achievements that can be tracked over time. With the routine presented in this article, you have an easy way to access your notes of the past period quite easily. It just gets easier if you use getworkrecognized. Our tool will remind you to write down your notes, even after COVID-19, so you have an easy process for creating the Self-Review and do not just have to look throughout every day’s chat to see what you have done in some period.</p></div></div>]]>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                On November 8th 1969, the "Zodiac Killer" sent the <a href="http://zodiackillerciphers.com/wiki/images/7/7d/340-cipher-hi-resolution.jpg">340 cipher</a> to The San Francisco Chronicle that has never
                been solved, even after 50 years of people trying to crack it.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Hollywood movie called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNncHPl1UXg">Zodiac</a> inspired me to try a few techniques on paper and I decided to create this tool once I realized how much easier this would be to puzzle through in an online format.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since it's been 50 years with no solution, the cipher is either a hoax or it has some advanced transpositions or encipherment that has not been guessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I might add more features to this like showing stats about sequences, options to save or share progress, and more options to try out other kinds of transpositions such as the period 19
                transposition discussed by David Oranchak in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hk__Hk5c9M">his presentation on this cipher</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        
        <div>
          <p>Early in 2018 <a href="https://f-i-ts.de/">FI-TS</a> decided to build a Kubernetes-as-a-Service solution for
financial institutions. As with every regulated industry, there are digital sovereignty concerns
regarding the control and access of data and compute. Hence, going to the public cloud isn’t feasible
for every workload. So, we got the task to find an enterprise ready stack for our own datacenter, while
also introducing the cloud native digital competency standards.</p>
<h4 id="why-we-built-metal-stack">Why we built metal-stack</h4>
<p>Initially we were looking for an infrastructure platform to run our Kubernetes services. However,
having advanced requirements, we couldn’t find one that fitted our needs. We evaluated different
products, but most of them had shortcomings with regards to networking or set boundary conditions
which we could not compromise on. Maybe OpenStack would have been an option, alas we had no operational
experience with it but already knew about its burdening complexity.</p>
<p>Our main requirements for our Kubernetes services were:</p>
<ul>
<li>fast provisioning (infrastructure and Kubernetes)</li>
<li>tight integration with Kubernetes and its services</li>
<li>high level of separation for sensitive environments (network segmentation)</li>
<li>modern network design and software designed networking</li>
<li>direct Bare-Metal servers without noisy neighbor challenges</li>
<li>deliver a cloud-native experience out of our own datacenters</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we strived for a Kubernetes idiomatic way of handling infrastructure components.</p>
<p>At that point we came across <a href="https://gardener.cloud/">SAP Gardener</a> project. SAP Gardener is a
cloud-agnostic Kubernetes cluster-manager that provides an API for Kubernetes installation and management.
And it is implemented with an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/02/gardener-project-update/">Inception design</a>,
adhering to the same Kubernetes idiomatic principles that we set as goal. As we didn’t want to manage all
our Kubernetes clusters manually, this became an important piece to our architecture.</p>
<p>Still missing a proper solution for the infrastructure layer, wanting a fresh and clean take on the overall
subject while willing to innovate, we decided:
“What could possibly go wrong. Let’s build our own…”</p>
<h4 id="our-solution-architecture">Our solution architecture</h4>
<p><img src="https://metal-stack.io/blog/01-why-metal-stack/metal-stack-architecture.png" alt="metal-stack architecture"></p>
<h5 id="network">Network</h5>
<p>Finding a really flexible and scalable solution that doesn’t cost a fortune, was one of the hardest challenges
in our quest. By researching and investigating conferences and talks from the big hyperscalers we came to the
conclusion, that we wanted to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open-Compute Networking equipment (we use EdgeCore Router, but any other vendor should be good), for
cheap hardware</li>
<li>Generic Network Operating System based on Linux for our Routers (we leverage Cumulus-Linux), for
good manageability</li>
<li>Layer-3 separation by starting an VRF instance for every Kubernetes cluster in our environment with
dedicated links for the worker-nodes</li>
<li>an <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/learn/resources/whitepapers/vxlan-routing-with-evpn">EVPN overlay</a>
network to build a lightweight SDN solution</li>
<li><a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/learn/resources/whitepapers/routing-host-benefits">Routing on the host</a>,
to gain high-availability and scalability</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, we decided to equip every cluster with a dedicated firewall, that connects the private VRF
instance with an exit router to the internet. This is accomplished by installing one of our servers from
the compute node pool with a special firewall Linux image. Also, we have implemented a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/firewall-policy-controller">Kubernetes controller</a>
that generates nftables rules for Services and NetworkPolicies deployed to the cluster.</p>
<h5 id="compute">Compute</h5>
<p>While Open-Compute hardware has interesting servers as well, we were forced to use the existing 19”-Racks in
our datacenter. Therefore, we chose to use a more conservative approach for our compute hardware. As we wanted
to have dedicated links for every server, we ruled out all Blade-Chassis with proprietary switches in their
chassis and decided to buy a bunch of Supermicro Big-Twin servers. These systems have four independent nodes in
a 2U rackmount, that share nothing but the power supplies. Each node is managed by a board management controller,
that can be managed with “standard” IPMI.</p>
<p>As it turned out this form factor is becoming increasingly popular and similar hardware is now available from
other vendors (Lenovo, Dell, …). With increasing standardization it should be possible to integrate any server
that is manageable by IPMI. However, as of today there seems to be no accepted standard IPMI. Each vendor (even model)
implementation has his own quirks. To prevent being caught in a lock-in, we started with a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/go-hal">hardware abstraction layer</a> that can be adjusted to these specific
characteristics. Metal-stack today runs with Supermicro X11DPT and X11SDV boards and we are expanding our range
with every new adopter (e.g. we know that there is someone working on support for Lenovo servers).</p>
<p>Pull requests for additional hardware are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>By default, all systems in our compute pool are assigned to a special management network, where a DHCP server
tells them to boot our bootstrapping agent, called <a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-hammer">metal-hammer</a>.
Essentially this agent does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It collects all kinds of inventory data from the server and uploads it to our control-service
(<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-api">metal-api</a>).</li>
<li>It waits for an installation request from the <a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-api">metal-api</a>,
downloads a <a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-images">machine image</a> and burns it to the system drive
of the server. When finished, a kexec call is made to boot the Linux kernel that was provided in the
machine image.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="storage">Storage</h5>
<p>To provide storage for our environment, we chose to equip each server with local NVMe or SATA drives. We make these
drives accessible as local persistent volumes from Kubernetes by integrating our
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/csi-lvm">LVM CSI driver</a> as a Gardener extension.</p>
<p>To make sure, that data stored on these drives is erased before handing over the node to a cluster, the
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-hammer">metal-hammer</a> either can erase the disks properly (which can take long)
or simply generates a new encryption key for the hardware encryption of the drives..</p>
<p>While having built this environment for the enterprise space, we did not attach an enterprise storage system to our
platform. Instead we use Rook/Ceph on our nodes and we are looking into other solutions for software defined storage,
but this is out of scope for this post.</p>
<h5 id="tooling">Tooling</h5>
<p>As we wanted to have the “Kubernetes feeling” for metal-stack we implemented (almost) everything in Go and tried
to reuse concepts like gRPC or Microservices for infrastructure management. Of course, there is also a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-go">Go library</a> and a command line tool
(<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metalctl">metalctl</a>) for accessing the metal-api.</p>
<p>To make Kubernetes play well together with metal-stack we have implemented a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-ccm">Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager</a> and a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/gardener-extension-provider-metal">Gardener extension provider</a>. With this
in place failed machines will get replaced automatically and and you can even use the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler
for automagical bare-metal server provisioning.</p>
<p>If you want to get a first impression on how metal-stack works, you can install mini-lab.
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/mini-lab">mini-lab</a> is our virtualized deployment, for local development.
It consists of VMs for two Routers (<a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-vx/">Cumulus VX</a>), a metal-api
instance and you can create VMs, that resemble the bare-metal hardware pool.</p>

		</div><p>It's Sweden's storied worker protections and climate-conscious citizens welcoming Amazon's ruthless drive for low prices. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Stockholm is preparing for a tug-of-war with one of the world’s most powerful companies — which just announced its entry into the Swedish market — and hopes that its arrival will mean the country of 10 million will be able to change Amazon, instead of being changed by it.</p>
<p>Amazon's plans — dubbed “<a href="https://www.ehandel.se/har-ar-amazon-se-det-blir-en-helsvensk-lansering" target="_blank">Project Dancing Queen</a>,” after the hit song by Swedish pop group Abba — don't have a lot of detail, but analysts believe its Swedish store will go live in the fall, in time for November’s Black Friday online shopping bonanza.</p>
<p>“Amazon has been supporting Swedish customers and selling partners across our different European stores for many years, but the next step is to bring a full retail offering to Sweden and we are making those plans now,” said Alex Ootes, Amazon’s vice president for EU expansion, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s turbo-capitalism corporate culture goes against the grain of Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries, which pride themselves in their strong labor unions and sustainability.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls” <em>— Jonas Arnberg, CEO of market-research firm HUI</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But the country also has an affluent, internet-savvy market ripe for Alexa, Kindles, Prime and the thousands of items on Amazon's online store, the company believes. Around 68 percent of Swedes shopped online in 2018, and they spent an average of €200 per online transaction. In total, the Nordic countries spent over €22 billion online in 2018, according to a <a href="https://www.postnord.fi/siteassets/raportit/verkkokauppa-pohjoismaissa/ecommerce-in-the-nordics-2019.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by PostNord, the country’s postal service.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of competition in online marketplaces, and nobody can match Amazon’s massive cornucopia of goods.</p>
<p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls,” said Jonas Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, a market research company.</p>
<p>Amazon will change that, and force local players to adopt e-commerce faster than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>“It’s a perfect storm in e-commerce now. The COVID-19 impact took us two to three years forward in digitalization. With Amazon’s entry it is going to go even further,” said Kristoffer Väliharju, the CEO of CDON, a Nordic online marketplace. Väliharju is optimistic about CDON’s chances of taking on the tech giant, but said companies without a strong e-commerce game will likely take a big hit.</p>
<p>Initially, Swedish and Nordic clients will be mainly served from German warehouses — known as fulfillment centers in Amazon-speak — with trucks driving up to Sweden through Denmark, and a fulfillment center operated by local partner Kuehne + Nagel in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, near Stockholm.</p>
<p>Analysts believe local warehouses are inevitable if Amazon is to offer one of its most unique selling points: quick delivery.</p>
<h3>When in Stockholm</h3>
<p>Establishing a local operation will be a major challenge for the company. American Amazon’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/how-amazon-is-fighting-back-against-workers-efforts-to-unionize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-union stance</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working culture</a> is the antithesis of pro-union Sweden. (Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven's political career is rooted in union activism dating from his time as a welder.)</p>
<p>The Swedish labor market is regulated by collective agreements between companies and unions, giving workers plenty of power over corporate decisions. Approximately 70 percent of Swedish workers belong to a union.</p>
<p>“If Amazon wants to succeed in Sweden, they need to work very closely with unions,” said Arne Andersson, an e-commerce expert at PostNord.</p>
<p>Amazon has not yet contacted Handels, the union representing warehouse workers, its political coordinator Emelie Wärn told POLITICO.</p>

<p>“Amazon is welcome to Sweden, but they have to sign a collective agreement. We will work very hard to get them to do that,” Wärn said.</p>
<p>“The fact that international companies takes interest in the Swedish market place is a positive thing. As an employer in Sweden you are obliged to follow Swedish labor legislation, which includes regulations regarding collective bargaining,” said Eva Nordmark, Sweden’s minister of employment, adding that approximately 90 percent of the employees in Sweden are covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>The minimum wage for a card-carrying Swedish warehouse worker is 142.50 Swedish krona (€13.85) per hour before tax, according to Handels. In contrast, Amazon’s Polish warehouse workers who serve the German market <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-amazon-employees-rage/">earn</a> 20 zlotys (around €4.50). Amazon said its workers in Germany earn a base pay of €11.10 an hour.</p>
<p>But the union is confident it will be able to negotiate with the tech goliath. Handels has done similar deals with Japanese fashion chain Uniqlo, Wärn said as an example.</p>
<p>But Uniqlo is not Amazon, and Handels' confidence might be misplaced, according to Markus Varsikko, a retail consultant at Dash Retail, which helps businesses use Amazon's marketplace.</p>
<p>“Amazon is a realist. If they can operate in Germany, they can operate in Sweden. It is an American company with American culture and thinking, and it is far from what we are used to here,” Varsikko said, arguing that Sweden's companies and workers might have to adapt — not the tech giant.</p>
<h3>Handels and Greta</h3>
<p>Amazon might also have to polish its sustainability credentials to appease Swedish consumers.</p>
<p>“What makes the Swedish market unique is that there is a great focus on companies to do good, be transparent and sustainable. For many Swedes, this is even more important than a wide range and low price,” said Niclas Eriksson, the CEO of electronics retailer Elgiganten. And thanks to local activist Greta Thunberg, consumers are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cancel-your-amazon-prime-subscription-save-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming increasingly aware</a> of the carbon footprint of services like next-day delivery.</p>
<blockquote><p>European consumer groups have slammed Amazon for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus Amazon's insistence on lower prices might not be its winning ticket.</p>
<p>The foray into the Swedish market by another e-commerce company, Wish, may serve as a cautionary tale. The American online marketplace, which mostly sells cheap items from China, tried and failed to take over the market a few years ago. The company first wooed consumers with dirt-cheap products such as electronics and clothes, only for Swedes to be disappointed by the quality of the products and frustrated by not being able to return products to sellers.</p>
<p>"[Wish] was cheap, it was a great marketplace, but it was also crap,” said PostNord’s Andersson. Wish did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Amazon's had troubles with quality control too. European consumer groups have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/online-marketplaces-rife-with-unsafe-and-illegal-items-study-shows/">slammed</a> the company for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform. The European Commission also put pressure on online platforms to control scammers and price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>CDON’s Väliharju said Swedish customers are very quality-conscious, and aware of their rights as consumers. Consumer groups and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-big-brands-chanel-canon-louis-vuitton-nike-are-taking-on-big-tech-silicon-valley-at-last/">brands</a> have criticized Amazon and others for not holding sufficient information about their sellers, especially for products that come from outside the European Union that could be dangerous or counterfeit.</p>
<p>“Amazon absolutely could be well met by Swedish consumers in the beginning,” said Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, citing Amazon’s promise of low prices, a big range of products and fast delivery.</p>
<p>“But in the long run they will have to adjust to Sweden."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>The hype is dead, long live the hype. After deep learning, a new entry is about ready to go on stage. The usual journalists are warming up their keyboards for blogs, news feeds, tweets, in one word, hype. This time it’s all about privacy and data confidentiality. The new words, <em>homomorphic encryption</em>.</p> <p>For the record, I am not personally against such a technology - quite the opposite I think it is very powerful and clever, rather against the misleading claims that usually make more followers than the technology itself. The purpose of this post is to shed light on homomorphic encryption, its benefits, and limitations, being as impartial as possible.</p> <h2 id="what-is-homomorphic-encryption">What is Homomorphic Encryption?</h2> <p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) is an encryption scheme that allows one to compute something like <code>Encrypted(2) + Encrypted(3) = Encrypted(5)</code>. While such operation does not shock anyone per se, as a matter of fact, operands <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and result <code>5</code> are <em>never</em> disclosed. Boom!</p> <p>The mathematics behind HE refers to the concept of <em>homomorphism</em> in algebra, a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type. Basically, both encryption and decryption functions can be thought of as homomorphisms between plaintext and ciphertext spaces. This definition explains why the sum of two operands in the plaintext space is preserved in the ciphertext space too.</p> <p>All computations within an HE setting are represented as either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_circuit">Boolean</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_circuit_complexity">arithmetic</a> circuits, depending on the type of computation to represent and the types of gates allowed in each one. Feel free to expand on this at the links provided above.</p> <p>The theory behind HE is not new (as the theory behind deep learning), being the first HE scheme proposed in the late 70s. Since then, many flavors of homomorphic encryption have been proposed, populating the literature with three major schemes recognized by the research community:</p> <ul> <li><strong>partially HE</strong>, supporting the evaluation of circuits of only one type of gate (e.g. only additions or only multiplications)</li> <li><strong>somewhat HE</strong>, capable of evaluating two types of gates</li> <li><strong>fully HE</strong>, capable of evaluating arbitrary circuits (becoming the most valuable and powerful of the three)</li> </ul> <p>From a practical perspective, <strong>somewhat homomorphic encryption</strong> schemes are limited to evaluating low-degree polynomials over encrypted data. Such a scheme is limited because each ciphertext is noisy, and such noise grows as one keeps performing additions and multiplications in the ciphertext space. At some point, the amount of noise that gets accumulated becomes so high that the resulting ciphertext becomes indecipherable. The presence of noise is essential to guarantee a certain degree of security and protecting the secret operands and results of intermediate computations. As in classic encryption, the value to be protected is spread in a large noisy space. The role of the secret key is to decipher and reconstruct securely the encrypted components of a computation. The aforementioned space is usually a very very large polynomial with a degree of 10K or more. In such a context, each coefficient is represented by more than 600 bits. This explains how large a dataset would become after encrypting it with HE schemes to guarantee industrial security. Obviously, one could trade security for a lower degree polynomial and a smaller cyphertext.</p> <p>For many realistic use cases, the only flavor of HE that is considered is <strong>fully HE</strong>. Performing additions and multiplications in an encrypted state are two essential operations to build all other non-primitive operations that are necessary to represent any type of computation. The ultimate goal of such a scheme would be to be capable of performing arbitrary circuits and essentially represent a Turing complete framework.</p> <h2 id="why-should-you-care-about-fhe">Why should you care about FHE?</h2> <p>Because under an FHE scheme no operand and no result is ever disclosed, highly regulated environments are the first to benefit of such a powerful property. Banks, social media platforms and pharmaceutical companies running their business in Amazon Web Services are in fact giving away their secrets. Because <em>“There’s no cloud. It’s just someone else’s computer”</em>. As a matter of fact, doing computation on a system that is being managed by third parties, means that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell">BOFH</a> has access to your data.</p> <p>While technologies like AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) implemented at the level of the CPU, encrypt the entire CPU state (basically all the registers) with keys that are not accessible to the other guests, many other use cases require more sophisticated approaches to the problem of data confidentiality. For instance, the requirements for private machine learning go beyond protecting the CPU state and register set.</p> <h2 id="homomorphic-encryption-in-the-real-world">Homomorphic encryption in the real world</h2> <p>Some practical - but nonexhaustive - use cases that would be possible with FHE schemes are listed below:</p> <ol> <li><strong>secure cloud outsourcing</strong> (e.g. sending both data and computation to Amazon EC2 instances and being sure nobody can access them) (already possible with SEV-ES and orders of magnitude more efficient)</li> <li>making the <strong>intersection of private sets</strong> without disclosing the results (e.g. find common records in two private datasets, without revealing any of the datasets, nor the common records if any)</li> <li>training <strong>machine learning</strong> models on private data without revealing the models</li> <li><strong>searching</strong> without revealing the query (nor the results)</li> </ol> <h3 id="performance-and-accuracy">Performance and accuracy</h3> <p>Security and confidentiality usually come at a very high cost in terms of performance. Highly regulated environments that are prone to trade performance for maximum security might be interested in adopting technology like FHE. But what are these costs?</p> <p>Benchmarks (the least scientific version of them) measured from the most widely used family of models in data science, linear regression, with a bit more than a dozen variables are provided below.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Computational cost</th> <th>Memory usage</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>[40x-50x]</td> <td>[10x-20x]</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For the data scientist who is used to train a model in about 1 hour, the same model under the FHE setting would take about 2 days. The same model requiring 2 GB of memory, would need about 30GB. Still doable, if that model is logistic regression. Let’s see how long training a neural network would take.</p> <p>A relatively small neural network that converges in approximately 12 hours, would take about 15 days. And the memory requirements would grow from 10GB to 150GB. However, despite the large divergence in terms of computational cost and memory usage, the accuracy degradation from computation in plaintext to one in cyphertext is negligible. The slight drop in accuracy is usually due to float-to-integer conversions. Each operation performed on a floating-point value decreases its accuracy a little for additions and a bit more for multiplications.</p> <p>Sometimes those overheads are acceptable in some domains e.g. analyzing financial data that are siloed among retail, loan, and investment banking. In many other domains (especially those in which a near real-time prediction is necessary), FHE could not even remotely be considered.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Homomorphic encryption is a very interesting field of research that - like deep learning - has been overlooked in the past years. Different market conditions and innovative findings in tech are making some of the FHE assumptions possible today.

An analogy I would definitely not like to see is the hype around a technology that not only is not ready and but is also limited by the theory of mathematics.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1113">Towards a Homomorphic Machine Learning Big Data Pipeline for the Financial Services Sector</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/IBM/fhe-toolkit-linux">IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit for Linux</a></p>  </div> </article>  </div></div>]]>

		Regardless of the outcome, the election will not stop the rise of hypernationalism, crisis cults and other signs of an empire's terminal decline. 	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chris Hedges </strong>/ Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The terminal decline of the United States will not be solved by elections. The political rot and depravity will continue to eat away at the soul of the nation, spawning what anthropologists call crisis cults — movements led by demagogues that prey on an unbearable psychological and financial distress. These crisis cults, already well established among followers of the Christian Right and Donald Trump, peddle magical thinking and an infantilism that promises — in exchange for all autonomy — prosperity, a return to a mythical past, order and security. The dark yearnings among the white working class for vengeance and moral renewal through violence, the unchecked greed and corruption of the corporate oligarchs and billionaires who manage our failed democracy, which has already instituted wholesale government surveillance and revoked most civil liberties, are part of the twisted pathologies that infect all civilizations sputtering towards oblivion. I witnessed the deaths of other nations during the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and later in the former Yugoslavia. I have smelled this stench before.</p>



<p>The removal of Trump from office will only exacerbate the lust for racist violence he incites and the intoxicating elixir of white nationalism. The ruling elites, who first built a mafia economy and then built a mafia state, will continue under Biden, as they did under Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, to wantonly pillage and loot. The militarized police will not stop their lethal rampages in poor neighborhoods. The endless wars will not end. The bloated military budget will not be reduced. The world’s largest prison population will remain a stain upon the country. The manufacturing jobs shipped overseas will not return and the social inequality will grow. The for-profit health care system will gouge the public and price millions more out of the health care system. The language of hate and bigotry will be normalized as the primary form of communication. Internal enemies, including Muslims, immigrants and dissidents, will be defamed and attacked. The hypermasculinity that compensates for feelings of impotence will intensify. It will direct its venom towards women and all who fail to conform to rigid male stereotypes, especially artists, LGBTQ people and intellectuals. Lies, conspiracy theories, trivia and fake news — what Hannah Arendt called “nihilistic relativism” — will still dominate the airwaves and social media, mocking verifiable fact and truth. The ecocide, which presages the extinction of the human species and most other life forms, will barrel unabated towards its apocalyptic conclusion.</p>



<p>“We run heedlessly into the abyss after putting something in front of us to stop us seeing it,” Pascal wrote.</p>

<hr>



<p>The worse it gets — and it will get worse as the pandemic hits us in wave after deadly wave with an estimated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">300,000 Americans dead by December</a> and possibly 400,000 by January — the more desperate the nation will become. Tens of millions of people will be thrown into destitution, evicted from their homes and abandoned. Social collapse, as Peter Drucker observed in Weimar Germany in the 1930s, brings with it a loss of faith in ruling institutions and ruling ideologies. With no apparent answers or solutions to mounting chaos and catastrophe — and Biden and the Democratic Party have already precluded the kind of New Deal programs and assault on oligarchic power that saved us during the Great Depression — demagogues and charlatans need only denounce all institutions, all politicians, and all political and social conventions while conjuring up hosts of phantom enemies. Drucker saw that Nazism succeeded not because people believed in its fantastic promises, but in spite of them. Nazi absurdities, he pointed out, had been “witnessed by a hostile press, a hostile radio, a hostile cinema, a hostile church, and a hostile government which untiringly pointed out the Nazi lies, the Nazi inconsistency, the unattainability of their promises, and the dangers and folly of their course.” Nobody, he noted, “would have been a Nazi if rational belief in the Nazi promises had been a prerequisite.” The poet, playwright and socialist revolutionary Ernst Toller, who was forced into exile and stripped of his citizenship when the Nazis took power in 1933, wrote much the same in his autobiography: “The people are tired of reason, tired of thought and reflection. They ask, what has reason done in the last few years, what good have insights and knowledge done us.” After Toller committed suicide in 1939, W.H. Auden in his poem “In Memory of Ernst Toller” wrote:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are lived by powers we pretend to understand:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrange our loves; it is they who direct at the end<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy bullet, the sickness, or even our hand.</p>



<p>The poor, the vulnerable, those who are not white or not Christian, those who are undocumented or who do not mindlessly repeat the cant of a perverted Christian nationalism, will be offered up in a crisis to the god of death, a familiar form of human sacrifice that plagues sick societies. Once these enemies are purged from the nation, we are promised, America will recover its lost glory, except that once one enemy is obliterated another takes its place. Crisis cults require a steady escalation of conflict. This is what made the war in the former Yugoslavia inevitable. Once one stage of conflict reaches a crescendo it loses its efficacy. It must be replaced by ever more brutal and deadly confrontations. The intoxication and addiction to greater and greater levels of violence to purge the society of evil led to genocide in Germany and the former Yugoslavia. We are not immune. It is what Ernst Jünger called a “feast of death.”</p>



<p>These crisis cults are, as Drucker understood, irrational and schizophrenic. They have no coherent ideology. They turn morality upside down. They appeal exclusively to emotions. Burlesque and celebrity culture become politics. Depravity becomes morality. Atrocities and murder become heroism. Crime and fraud become justice. Greed and nepotism become civic virtues. What these cults stand for today, they condemn tomorrow. At the height of the reign of terror on May 6, 1794 during the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre announced that the Committee for Public Safety now recognized the existence of God. The French revolutionaries, fanatical atheists who had desecrated churches and confiscated church property, murdered hundreds of priests and forced another 30,000 into exile, instantly reversed themselves to send to the guillotine those who disparaged religion. In the end, exhausted by the moral confusion and internal contradictions, these crisis cults yearn for self-annihilation.</p>



<p>The French sociologist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emile-Durkheim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">Emile Durkheim</a> in his classic book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suicide-Penguin-Classics-Emile-Durkheim-ebook/dp/B002RI9XE2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">On Suicide</a>” found that when social bonds are shattered, when a population no longer feels it has a place or meaning in a society, personal and collective acts of self-destruction proliferate. Societies are held together by a web of social bonds that give individuals a sense of being part of a collective and engaged in a project larger than the self. This collective expresses itself through rituals, such as elections and democratic participation or an appeal to patriotism, and shared national beliefs. The bonds provide meaning, a sense of purpose, status and dignity. They offer psychological protection from impending mortality and the meaninglessness that comes with being isolated and alone. The breaking of these bonds plunges individuals into deep psychological distress. Durkheim called this state of hopelessness and despair anomie, which he defined as “ruleless-ness.”</p>



<p>Ruleless-ness means the norms that govern a society and create a sense of organic solidarity no longer function. The belief, for example, that if we work hard, obey the law and get a good education we can achieve stable employment, social status and mobility along with financial security becomes a lie. The old rules, imperfect and often untrue for poor people of color, nevertheless were not a complete fiction in the United States. They offered some Americans — especially those from the white working and middle class — modest social and economic advancement. The disintegration of these bonds has unleashed a widespread malaise Durkheim would have recognized. The self-destructive pathologies that plague the United States — opioid addiction, gambling, suicide, sexual sadism, hate groups and mass shootings — are products of this anomie. So is our political dysfunction. My book, “<a href="http://freshstore.truthdig.com/america-the-farewell-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">America: The Farewell Tour</a>,” is an examination of these pathologies and the widespread anomie that defines American society.</p>



<p>The economic structures, even before the pandemic, were reconfigured to mock faith in a meritocracy and the belief that hard work leads to a productive and valued role in society. American <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+economic+productivity&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">productivity</a>, as The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/magazine/americans-jobs-poverty-homeless.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">pointed out</a>, has increased 77 percent since 1973 but hourly pay has grown only 12 percent. If the federal minimum wage was attached to productivity, the newspaper wrote, it would be more than $20 an hour now, not $7.25. Some 41.7 million workers, a third of the workforce, earn less than $12 an hour, and most of them do not have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. A decade after the 2008 financial meltdown, the Times wrote, the average middle class family’s net worth is more than $40,000 below what it was in 2007. The net worth of black families is down 40 percent, and for Latino families the figure has dropped 46 percent. Some four million evictions are filed each year. One in four tenant households spends <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">about half its pretax income</a> …</p></div></div>

<p>Many prominent figures have attempted to answer the question of what, if anything, makes life meaningful, although they typically have not put it in these terms. Consider, for example, Aristotle on the human function, Aquinas on the beatific vision, and Kant on the highest good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does it mean to live a meaningful life? This question has been posed by philosophers since ancient times. In his book On the Happiness of Man (c. 450 BCE), Plato asks whether there is any way we can be happy without achieving certain goals or desires. And in his dialogue Phaedo (c. 380 BCE) Socrates asks whether the pursuit of pleasure is always desirable; he concludes that it isn’t, and that happiness lies elsewhere. In the early modern period, William Godwin’s essay What Is Art? (1793) provides a classic formulation of this problem. More recently, existentialist thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus have explored this issue through their writings about existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, most contemporary philosophers do not address the question directly. Why is it that so few people seem to find life meaningful? To answer this question, I will focus on two main issues: (1) what makes something meaningful; and (2) how can we know what is important in our lives? My aim here is not to provide a comprehensive account of the nature of meaning. Rather, my goal is simply to identify those aspects of life that make us feel alive and happy.</p>



<p>Meaning in life can be thought of as the goal-directed behavior that we engage in as a result of making conscious choices. This concept has been debated by many philosophers, especially those in the existentialist tradition. However, the general idea is fairly intuitive: we all have a sense that our choices matter and that we can affect the world around us. Indeed, this idea is so intuitive that it is practically a tautology. So, what exactly is it about conscious choice that makes life meaningful?</p>



<p>One aspect of meaning in life is its ethical component. This follows from the fact that morality provides us with reasons for action. These reasons can be either moral or amoral, but either way they are the foundations upon which our actions and choices rest. There are three components to these reasons: facts, values, and obligation.</p>



<p>Our lives are governed by facts, and this is what gives rise to the distinction between the objective and subjective. For instance, it is a fact that it is currently Monday. This fact is objective since it is independent of human opinion; in other words, it would remain true whether or not anyone believed it to be true. It is also a fact that I am currently typing on my keyboard. However, facts can be divided into two categories: brute facts and institutional facts. Institutional facts are grounded in brute facts, but they also depend upon human agreement or consent for their veracity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, the fact that it is illegal to drive on the sidewalk is an institutional fact; this is made true by human agreement, but it would not be true unless people agreed or consented to this rule. By contrast, the fact that I have five fingers on my right hand is a brute fact; it is true whether or not humans believe it to be true. The distinction between brute facts and institutional facts is an important one, because many of our facts are institutional in nature. It is for this reason that we can question the meaning of our lives.</p>



<p>The meaning of life can be seen as a function of the facts that govern it. Some facts give meaning to our lives by giving it a purpose or goal; these facts are value-laden, and as such, they provide reasons for action. For instance, I might value health because I want to live a long and happy life. Other facts give meaning to our lives by imposing obligations upon us; for instance, I have a duty to pay my taxes because it is the law.</p>



<p>Meaning arises from the relationship between facts and values. Consider an example: many people value wealth, but the acquisition of wealth does not in itself give life meaning. Rather, it is the value that one places on wealth that imbues it with meaning. This value could be the result of an objective fact; for instance, one might acquire wealth in order to give to those who are poorer than themselves. In this case, acquiring wealth would be the means to an end, and that end would be the satisfaction of helping others. By contrast, one might acquire wealth without any intention of helping others; in this case, the value that one places on wealth would be the result of a subjective fact. It is important to note that this subjective fact need not be an opinion or a matter of preference; it could just as easily be something that one “just feels.”</p>



<p>Whatever the source, values provide reasons for action. These reasons are given validity by our choices and decisions. We can make choices and decisions based on facts alone, but this would not give meaning to our lives; it is the incorporation of values that gives meaning to our lives. In this way, we make meaning out of the world around us. Without values, life would be nothing more than a series of random and disconnected events. With values, life becomes a journey with a purpose.</p>



<p>In short, the meaning of life is found in the relationships between facts and values. If you wish to find your own meaning in life, then you must first determine what makes up your values. Then, you must determine how those facts relate to each other and ultimately to yourself. Once you have done so, you will know what it is that makes up your sense of self and thus what it is that defines your worth as a person.</p>

If you can calculate \(4 \cdot 5 \equiv 6\) in \(\mathbb{F}_7\), you’re good to go.</p>  <p>A <em>zero knowledge protocol</em> is a protocol that allows you to prove that you know some specific mathematical fact, without revealing any information about the fact itself. The proof generated in a zero knowledge protocol is called a <em>zero knowledge proof</em>.</p> <p>Some examples of “mathematical facts” that we can create zero knowledge proofs for include things like:</p> <ul> <li>Knowledge of a three-coloring of a graph (i.e. I know a three-coloring of this publicly-known graph, and I’ll prove that I know it without showing you the coloring)</li> <li>Knowledge of the discrete logarithm of some residue modulo \(p\) (i.e. given public generator \(g\), public modulus \(p\), and some residue \(y\), I know \(x\) such that \(g^x \equiv y\) modulo \(p\))</li> <li>Knowledge of a private key corresponding to a publicly-known public key</li> </ul> <p>The idea of a zero knowledge protocol might seem paradoxical at first glance: how can I prove I know something without showing you the thing that I know? However, it turns out that we actually use zero knowledge protocols all the time! For example, familiar tools like digital signatures are actually zero knowledge proofs. By signing a message, I prove that I know the private key that corresponds to a widely-known public key, but I don’t give away any information about the private key itself. In fact, public-key encryption only works because it is a zero knowledge protocol; if signatures revealed information about your private key, then malicious actors would be able to impersonate you by analyzing your signatures and recovering your private key.</p> <p>Slightly more formally, suppose that you’ve computed \(f(\cdot) = y\) for some publicly known function \(f\) and some secret input \(\cdot\). A zero-knowledge protocol for the function \(f\) would allow you to prove to others that you know a secret input to \(f\) that results in \(y\), without revealing this secret input \(\cdot\).</p> <p>For more on ZKPs, check out <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/">this post</a>.</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, ZKPs are protocols that allow you to prove knowledge of a specific mathematical fact: discrete log, knowledge of private key, knowledge of three-coloring, etc. However, it’s important to note that early ZKPs only allowed you to prove one kind of mathematical fact at the time. That is, cryptographers developed one protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of discrete log, another protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of three-coloring, and another protocol for digital signatures. But what if we want to generate zero knowledge proofs for arbitrary mathematical functions? For example - what if I want a zero knowledge protocol that would allow me to prove that I know the pre-image of a SHA256 hash output? It would be intractable if, for every use case, I had to go to a cryptographer and ask them to custom-write me a new protocol.</p> <p>zkSNARKs solve this problem. A zkSNARK is a gadget that can be used to generate a ZKP for any mathematical function. Basically, you feed the “code” of a function \(f\) into a zkSNARK, and the SNARK creates a protocol that allows you to generate zero-knowledge proofs for \(f\).</p> <p>As an example, say we have a fake “hash” function \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\) that we’d like to generate zero knowledge proofs for. First, we can use a zkSNARK to generate a ZKP for \(h\). Then, we can use this generated ZKP to prove claims like “I know a value \(\cdot\) such that \(h(\cdot) = 67\)” - <em>without revealing \(\cdot\)</em>. zkSNARKs also guarantee that this process is “succinct” and “non-interactive”: we can create this proof in linear time, and others can verify it in constant time, without needing to ask additional questions of us (the prover). Together, these properties form a zkSNARK: a <em>Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge</em>.</p> <p>These properties makes SNARKs useful for blockchain applications, where users can create proofs locally, and then upload short proofs for constant-time verification inside a smart contract, where computation is expensive.</p>  <p>A central mechanic in Dark Forest is that the cryptographic “fog of war.” The fog of war ensures that you don’t automatically know where all players, planets, and other points of interests are in the universe; you have to spend computational resources to discover them. This mechanic is secured by zkSNARKs.</p> <p>In a universe with a fog of war, the locations of all players are private and hidden from each other. This means that players don’t upload the coordinates of their planets to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be publicly inspected. Instead, each player uploads the hash of their location to the blockchain. This ensures that players stay “committed” to a specific location, but also that the location can’t be determined from inspection of the Ethereum data layer.</p> <p>Without zkSNARKs, there’s an obvious attack vector - if a player uploads a random string of bytes that doesn’t correspond to a real and valid location, and the integrity of the game is broken. To prevent this, Dark Forest requires players to submit zkSNARKs with every move to ensure that players are indeed submitting hashes corresponding to valid coordinates that they have knowledge of.</p> <p>When players make moves, they’re also required to submit ZK proofs that their moves are “valid” - you can’t move too far or too fast. Without zkSNARKs, a malicious player could make illegal “teleport” moves by claiming that the hash they are moving from is next to the hash they’re moving to, even if the two locations are actually on opposite sides of the universe. Once again, requiring ZK proofs keeps players honest. To use a chess analogy, the required ZK proofs basically tell the contract, “I’m moving my knight; I’m not going to tell you where I moved my knight from, or where I moved it to, but this proof proves that it did in fact move in a legal L-shape.”</p> <p>We’ll dive deeper into the Dark Forest construction and SNARKs in a future blog post!</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, SNARKs are gadgets which take in a function and output a ZKP for said function. So how do we “feed” a function to a SNARK?</p> <p>SNARKs functions are written as circuits in the Circom language. Here’s an example circuit for our “fake” hash function, \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\).</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// file: circuit.circom</span>

<span>template</span> <span>BadHash</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>private</span> <span>input</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>x_squared</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>x_cubed</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>output</span> <span>out</span><span>;</span>

    <span>x_squared</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>x_cubed</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x_squared</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>out</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x_cubed</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>component</span> <span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>BadHash</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our zkSNARK takes in this circuit, chews it up, and spits out a <em>proving key</em> and a <em>verifying key</em>. The proving key allows a prover who is computing <code>BadHash(x) = out</code> to generate a proof that they do indeed know the pre-image of <code>out</code>. The verifying key allows anyone to inspect that proof, along with <code>out</code>, and conclude that the prover did honestly carry out the computation with a known secret input.</p> <p>Concretely, suppose that the prover computes <code>BadHash(4) = 67</code>. The prover publishes their proof, along with <code>out = 67</code>, to the verifier; however, they do not publish the secret input <code>x = 4</code>. The verifier of this proof knows the source code of the <code>BadHash</code> circuit, and also receives <code>out = 67</code> and a proof from the prover. The verifier can then inspect the proof to verify that the prover did indeed compute some valid x, x_squared, and x_cubed to arrive at <code>out</code>. However, the verifier won’t know the specific values that the prover used (<code>x = 4</code>, <code>x_squared = 16</code>, <code>x_cubed = 64</code>) - just that these values were computed correctly.</p> <p>There are two things which make SNARK circuits different from normal “functions” that we’re used to.</p> <p>First, you’ll notice that BadHash only uses three operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. At the base level, SNARK constraints are limited to only these operations. There are ways to do operations like division and modulo, but they all ultimately involve breaking operations down into sums and products. The fact that we’re limited to these operations is part of what makes SNARK programming thorny.</p> <p>The second challenge is that each signal in a SNARK is an element of a prime field, and all operations happen inside that prime field. The most obvious implication of this is that there is no native notion of decimals, fractions, negative numbers, or numbers bigger than 77 digits. If you want one of these, you have to make them out of positive integers smaller than <code>p</code>. Another implication is that our operators “wrap around”: the result of <code>3 - 5</code> is <code>p - 2</code>, which is a 77 digit number. The prime is large enough (254) that most of the time this doesn’t matter, but occasionally it can cause subtle correctness bugs.</p> <p>To actually make proofs, we use a library called <a href="https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs">SnarkJS</a>, built by Jordi Baylina and Iden3. <code>SnarkJS</code> uses your circuit to generate proving and verification code in JavaScript and Solidity, as well as protocol paramters and proving and verification keys. This is out of the scope of this post, but you can find a tutorial on it <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circom/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md">here</a>.</p> <p>In the next posts, we’ll talk about the execution model of SNARKs, including the difference between calculation and constraint, and how to do operations like division and modulo.</p> </div> </div>  </div></div>]]>

      <div>
        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>This post lays out an overview of the guiding principles driving much of the
work behind the main parts of the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan Project</a>. For
those unaware, Arcan is presented as something as uncommon as a ‘desktop
engine’. The grand claim is that modifying and understanding the entirety of
your desktop should be ‘patching scripts’ level easy if we rework current
popular abstractions and adjust the division of labour.</p>

<p>The principles themselves link together to tell a large chunk of the vision of
the ‘divergent desktop’; a story that has been slowly getting its shape over
many years, greatly influenced by a number of publicly documented experiments
as well as seminal works such as Von Neumann’s “The Computer and the Brain”,
Norbert Weiner’s “The Human use of Human Beings”, Ian Hacking on “Representing
and Intervening”, Jaron Lanier’s trilogy on what the future may hold in store,
as well as the nowadays less digestible amalgamation of +Fravia’s Search Lores.</p>

<p>The overview is quite a long read in its own right, and full versions of each
principle will be added as individual articles over time – If the contents in
the sections here comes off as a bit dense and hard to ingest, fret not! They
are more teasers or appetisers, the full course meal will have better pacing
and technical depth.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="backstory-and-motivation">Backstory and Motivation</h2>

<p>The Arcan project, at its core, is rooted in assumption that the ‘desktop’ way
of interfacing with computing is inching towards its last of breaths, and
rewriting X11 or JSONifying STDOUT won’t provide much more air than for a final
gasp.</p>

<p>The upside is that this may well turn out to be something positive that
provides opportunity for radical simplification and restructuring of the myriad
of technologies that make out the Rube Goldbergian contraption that is the ‘modern’
desktop.</p>

<p>The first non-academic presentation (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=07nqZIFRDJg">video</a>)
on the Arcan project had a terse, technical-overview style to it, with very little
in terms of motivation or actual intended direction.</p>

<p>The reason for that was that I wanted to keep the attention and focus on “what it is”
rather than “what will it ever be used for”, and carefully note who tries to fill
in the cryptic blank spaces, and with what. This was predicated on the belief
that honest dissemination is done by first demonstrating the feasibility and
soundness of the fundamentals of the tech in isolation; flowery visions,
soap-boxing and sociopolitical annotation are best left deferred to separate
stages should the underlying tech be sufficiently coherent and robust.</p>

<p>It is not, however, some vacuous perspective of the technology as living a life
disjunct from the social consequences of its application, but having that as
the goto default mental model for any fledgling utterances is as much of a
fool’s errand as thinking that it should never be viewed through the optics of
an abstract larger social organism.</p>

<p>The basic motivation for <em>all</em> of this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am of humble needs and wants: I want to expand my agency, security, safety and quality of experience in regards to all things that computing touch. The largest obstacle to that expansion, right now, is the chaos and complexity of user-space, the dependency creep towards an online ‘service-space’, the peering eyes this ‘service space’ uses to study and repackage some naive interpretation of ‘you’, and how this service space is being used to mutate social- and critical- infrastructure towards something wholly frightening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a personal level, I have coded and experimented with virtually everything
computing since the days of the venerable C-64 (divide it by two, flip it over,
that’s 23) – viruses, anti-viruses; drm protections, cracks; database
engines; operating system kernels; cheats, bots and anti-cheats; emulators
(both interpreter dance and JITterbug); demos; games; parsers for more
formats than I can remember; exploits as well as mitigations. I have worked in
academia, government, military-industrial, fortune-500 as well as fledgling
startups, and got the scars and theses to prove it. The ‘left to observe’ list
has grown rather short over the years.</p>

<p>During this time, the evolution of the capabilities of the devices themselves
have exceeded all expectactions and is nothing short of spectacular. The
hardware and software lockout which plagued the early days is, relatively
speaking, minor; access to both capable devices and deep technical information
has become absolutely stellar, overwhelmingly so. The days of begging companies
for scraps of hardware; scraping public libraries and dumpsters for slices of
information; for quid-pro-quo trading of hacker ‘secrets’ and basic software
building blocks (‘warez’) are mostly faint memories. Hopefully they will remain
as such in spite of troubling signs up ahead.</p>

<p>The counterweight to this positive development is that things have become complex
to the degree that a thorough and deep understanding, <em>preconditions</em> to responsible
control and agency, is a hard thing to come by, and an even harder thing to fight
for. Just add more dependencies and layers! Get it to market! Cash out! Build a
community! Become its figurehead! Sell the community! Pass the plate! Don’t forget
to Like Comment and Subscribe! Oh and this message was sponsored by yet another
pointless VPN from a provider you can’t trust but somehow protects you from a
network you don’t trust. With such words the once so tiny tech snowball continues
its merry way down the mountain towards the village.</p>

<p>No matter the outcome, I have more things on the immediate ‘todo’ in terms of
creative things alone – than I have hours left to live, regardless of how many
those turn out to be. That is a pleasant mental image to fall back on in times of
gloom and doom.</p>

<p>My dedication to this project and the tens of thousands of invested hours has
been described as both ‘a labour of love’ as well as the more colloquial
‘fucking insane’, though personally, I view it as an act of necessity.</p>

<p>Many a times the journey has felt like digging out of a prison using the
collarbone of a fallen mate as a makeshift shovel, fuelled by the vapours of
some faint hope that there is a relatively more free world waiting within
reach, and that the proverbial roses I can smell are not just a hallucinogenic
side effect from some invisible gas deposit that this old canary has stumbled
upon.</p>

<p>The motivation is not all some evolutionary struggle for freedom. The rest
comes from bitter anger, even resentment, towards the dominant status quo and
the trajectory that computing interfaces as a whole is moving along; pandering
to trivial attention grabbing nonsense (‘engagement’) rather than crafting
sharper tools that can claw at the delicious problems that the future holds in
store.</p>

<h2 id="principle-1-professionals-first">Principle 1: Professionals First</h2>


<p>The traditional desktop is a compromise of interests, with the more recent bias
being towards appealing to a supposed ‘mainstream’ audience. This made sense
from an economical growth standpoint within the kinetics of the peculiar brand
of capitalism at the time; the previous demographic was already hooked on the
computing drug - being ‘users’ after all.</p>

<p>The thing nowadays is that the load-bearing mainstream audience is opting out at
a rapid rate and for good reason; smartphones, tablets, digital ‘assistants’,
gaming consoles and so on are all chopping up the generic ‘desktop’ into more
controlled corporate thiefdoms.</p>

<p>Many of the past compromises that were made in order to accomodate this wider
and less experienced audience are also unnecessarily restricting agency,
precision and and efficiency for those (‘the professional’) who possess both a
stronger mental model of computing, and a vested interest in its advancement.</p>

<p>It makes little sense to try and convince your grandmother that she needs a
Free! Open-Source! desktop, and it is a farce, bordering on self-harm, to still
use that scenario as part of some requirement specification for the future.</p>

<p>That aside, the ‘professional’ here is not meant as a vain appeal to exclusionary
hacker elitism – before the numbers of those within such lines dip towards that
of past ‘biker freedom’ seekers such as radio ‘amateurs’, circuit benders and
BBS operators. The ‘professional’ is acknowledging that there is a large number
(millions) of key individuals in a wide gamut of professions that are currenty
wasting much of their time and talents thanks to misguided attempts at software
ergonomics that will try and make due with what the web can give them, but they
should not have to.</p>

<p><em>Revisit past workflows, put the professional first.</em></p>


<h2 id="principle-2-diversify-experience">Principle 2: Diversify Experience</h2>

<p>A long standing maxim in computing is that of ‘mechanism, not policy’. From
a user experience perspective, it is rooted in the assumption that the user
is both willing- and capable- of leveraging mechanisms and configure them into
their own sets of policies. This has largely failed in the ‘desktop’ sense,
and very much stagnated in the command-line processing one.</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons for this, and one likely culprit on a high
level is the marketing gospel of ‘it just works’. This is a rhetoric which
strongly favours a ‘brand identity’ preset of strict policies and aesthetics
at the desktop level and beyond. Its implementation allows for little to no
accessible layering in between the opaqueness of a UI element such as a
‘button’ and the set of actions the idea of it ‘working’ represents.</p>

<p>This turns into a problem when your personal expectations of what ‘just works’
happens to clash with those of …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a startup founder, I frequently receive questions from friends, family, acquaintances, about how this mysterious fundraising process works. In short, <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/playbooks/funding/structure-your-fundraise"><u>raising venture capital</u></a> funds is a business deal in which you exchange equity, or a percentage of company ownership, for the capital your business needs to grow, in the form of investment funds.</p><p>Rapidly just raised our Seed round in February and now I am currently in the process of raising our Series A in the midst of COVID-19 and a faltering economy. While Rapidly is currently growing despite an economic recession and has plenty of runway from our Seed round, it’s important for every founder to know exactly <i>when</i> they should be fundraising.</p><p>Generally, there are two positions that your company can be in when you as a founder are looking to raise venture capital. These are preemptive fundraising or reactive fundraising.</p><h2><b>Reactive Fundraising</b></h2><p>In a reactive fundraising process, you may only have 3-6 months of funds left in the bank. You may be in a position of going out of business if no further funds are raised. The goal of this funding round is to try to keep the company alive.</p><p>You may be trying to sell a story of needing another 18 months of runway to figure things out and optimize your company to be able to keep growing. This is where bridge rounds from previous investors may come into play, which can help buy time for the business as you raise a larger round.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no or little leverage when your company is in this vulnerable position and teetering on the edge of closing. Investors are going to be especially particular about evaluating your business model to see if it could succeed in any way in the future.</p><h2><b>Preemptive Fundraising</b></h2><p>If you are in a <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-strategic-guide-to-preemptive-funding-offers/"><u>preemptive fundraising</u></a> situation, your company is not running out of money yet and you are generally secure for the time being. You still have funds from your last round in the bank account, with a 9-18 month buffer of money. If no fundraising happens right now your business will be fine. If your company revenues are still growing month over month, you can feel confident in the business.</p><p>In this position, you as a founder have more leverage and have more room to vet potential investors to see if they’re really going to be a good fit for your business. You may have investors reaching out to you during this time who are hearing about you in the press. You are able to evaluate the value they could add to your business, from a stronger position.</p><h2><b>How to vet your investors</b></h2><p>As a founder, you don’t want to just take venture capital money from any interested investor. As much as they are vetting you and your business model, you should also be vetting them. When doing a preemptive round of fundraising, you will have the most leverage and can be more picky in what you’re looking for from investors.</p><p>A few questions that can help weed out the bad investors, double down on the good investors, and keep your options open:</p><ul><li><p>Are they contributing to the growth and success of your business, or are they just asking about how numbers are looking each month?</p></li><li><p>How quickly do they follow up with you after your meetings?</p></li><li><p>How mutually respectful are they of your limited time as an entrepreneur and timely with follow-ups are they?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How communicative are they about whether they are interested in investing or not?&nbsp;</p></li><li><ul><li><p>You are typically not directly asking for the term sheet, but following up asking them if they are interested in learning more about the company</p></li></ul></li><li><p>How high is their interest level in your business and industry?</p></li><li><p>How is the performance of their investment portfolio?</p></li></ul><h2><b>The importance of investor relationships</b></h2><p>Choosing your investors wisely is a crucial part of being a founder and raising money, as these are long-lasting business relationships. Typically in the process of investing from pre-seed to seed to Series A, you will be having different investors in each round.

<p>Most likely, Joe Biden will pick his Vice President at some point in the next 10 days. The Democratic National Convention begins on August 17th and only two candidates in modern history have waited until then to announce their running mate.</p>



<p>Biden’s VP selection has been the largest (and essentially the only) story receiving constant attention related to his campaign for President over the last few months. It has been followed closely only by the narrative that he has lost his marbles which has flared up once again following his regrettable comments about African Americans the other day. One could even speculate that the first storyline has been dragged out by Biden’s campaign intentionally in order to prevent the second from receiving more attention than it already is.</p>



<p>These top two storylines are fundamentally about indecision and a lack of fitness to serve as President, respectively. These are not good themes for someone aiming to get elected President, a role which requires one to be decisive and fit to serve as two of the most primary prerequisites.</p>



<p>I remain baffled by the way Biden’s original VP guarantee has been almost unanimously applauded and totally uncontroversial in the media. If Biden knew his pick already and she was a woman, I would have had no problem with him saying so a few months ago without prematurely revealing her identity at that stage. That was clearly not the case.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that Biden had no idea who he was going to pick when he made that guarantee to help secure the primary. This has been demonstrated by months of indecision on the matter with several names moving up and down the leaderboard of his most likely picks. This, to me, makes his guarantee an unfortunate one, though I try to give him the benefit of the doubt that his intentions were good at best and simply to get votes at worst.</p>



<p>That said, if I was a woman, I cannot imagine that I would want the first female Vice President to be selected this way, with the fact that she is a woman being the first and most outwardly advertised criteria. Furthermore, it now seems that our potential next VP’s race has become the second most necessary qualification, although Biden has not as explicitly said so.</p>



<p>I believe that the first female Vice President deserves to be selected at least apparently because she is the best person for the job, not just because she is the best woman for the job or the best black woman for the job. She should be chosen as the best candidate from a field that includes the best of the best regardless of gender or race. Anything else suggests that no woman is capable of landing the position by merit and that is so obviously not true.</p>



<p>Have people already forgotten that Hillary won the popular vote last election? We were well on our way to having our first female President well before this ugly and unnecessary VP guarantee.</p>



<p>Barack Obama won back to back elections to become the first black President. Can you imagine how much less meaningful that would have been if he was instead elected after we decided as a country that we were only going to pick from a pool of black candidates that year? Americans decided he was the best person for the job. That’s how it should be.</p>



<p>Biden’s VP selection comes with added consequence considering he would become the oldest President in America’s history on his first day in The Oval Office. Assuming he makes it through his first term, which is all but guaranteed, it seems doubtful that he would run for a second one. That would leave his VP as the candidate closest to being an incumbent and, all else equal, the most likely to win.</p>



<p>To be clear, I look forward to the day we have our first female President. I just hope she rises to power via election by the people of America, not via selection by the consultants of a presidential candidate who are only looking to assure the greatest possible benefit to his polls.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vue-next (Vue 3) has been out for a while. It is now under release candidate stage which means there won't be big changes on the open APIs. Good to see that Vue has already been stabilized and ready to waltz into our projects.</p><p>I have to say that Vue 2 is already amazing enough. But with Vue 3's new features, it's likely to upgrade our projects to an upper level. I guess the most thrilling feature in Vue 3 would be the composition APIs. Evan You himself mentioned that the composition APIs are inspired by the React hooks. Even though the two APIs hooks and compositions are a lot alike, but from the code base they are completely different. Let's not discuss which is better or promising because I don't really think either framework outraces another.</p><p>In all, it's so happy to see that Vue can also do what React does. Let's have a close look at the new features.</p><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p><h2 id="1-vite"><a href="#1-vite">1.

(For example, data formatting / calculation etc).</p><p>Let's see how Vue 3 doc explains why <code>filters</code> is removed:</p><blockquote><p>While this seems like a convenience, it requires a custom syntax that breaks the assumption of expressions inside of curly braces being "just JavaScript," which has both learning and implementation costs.</p></blockquote><p>I believe it's nothing bad for development without the <code>filters</code>, even though it may cost you extra time on migrating to Vue 3. In my projects, the appearance of <code>filters</code> is pretty a rare case since I could replace such functionality with a <code>method</code> or <code>computed</code> easily.

<div id="outline-container-orgcf4562a">
<h2 id="orgcf4562a">i hope they have emacs in heaven</h2>
<div id="text-orgcf4562a">
<p>
Thunderstorms appeal to me. It isn't just that I'm an introvert at heart, and a nature lover. It's something else, too. Ever since childhood, long before the turbulent adolescent years that gave me lifelong anxiety and simultaneously brought me fledgling UNIX, I've always loved the rain.<br>
</p>

<p>
I share that as a calibration of sorts, to establish that I know when something fits without justification or psychological precedent. And I don't so much seek the rain as the atmosphere it carries, a sort of rarefied buffering of the noise and whirling madness of everyday life, a sort of something-sacred-this-way-comes vestment that drops over the daylight and matches the energy of the day to my baseline mood.<br>
</p>

<p>
So when I say that emacs resonates in a similar way with me, you'll see that I've thought about this.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2b435cb">
<h3 id="org2b435cb">mind mapping and marval priorities</h3>
<div id="text-org2b435cb">
<p>
There was one other time that I discovered something in-phase for me. In the mid-nineties, when I lived in Atlanta, I got my hands on a shareware disc. I was ghosting a book for the retired CEO of a heavy equipment conglomerate, and part of the deal was a primo laptop.  On that CD drive, I discovered a shareware CD, forgotten, with some cool programs.<br>
</p>

<p>
The most interesting of the two were a program called "Above and Beyond," which automatically shifted tasks by juggling timeblocks, and a then-unknown tool from Tony Buzan called "MindManager." I set about using them both, and they were definitely on my wavelength, but both of them induced a standing wave ratio greater than 3.0 in my head.  The ideas came furiously, and the tasks got blitzed at warp speed, but there was no navigator.<br>
</p>

<p>
Unfocused creative activity is a like a drug: it feels amazing, but it leads you nowhere in particular without realizing that you've disconnected from reality.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0999547">
<h3 id="org0999547">enter emacs</h3>
<div id="text-org0999547">
<p>
Luckily, I discovered emacs before I was too far gone. It might have been the timing, it might have been the flexibility, it might have been the fact that I could do everything from one screen (while constantly changing the screen without actually losing anything). Something about it felt right to me, a perfect fit, like rain has always felt.<br>
</p>

<p>
As emacs has grown over the years, and I have grown with it, I've found a way to meet all my screen needs with it.  It is at once disciplined and flexible, spontaneous and ordered, frenetic and balanced. Actually, that's not quite true: I'm the one who's bringing all the contradictions; emacs just provides a flexible vessel that can handle them and blend them and support their contrapuntal coexistence in a sort of seamlessly cantankerous way. And that makes it a perfect fit for me.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org81908bd">
<h3 id="org81908bd">I don't recommend it, per sei</h3>
<div id="text-org81908bd">
<p>
My purpose here is not to promote emacs, but to encourage finding events and phenomena and tools and people that fit your way of being. When I hired into the MAAS team at Canonical, I knew I had found my people. I can be the class clown and the IRC troll and the mediator and the explainer all at the same time, and nobody doubts those roles, and nobody sees that as good or bad: it's just who I am, and I fit, and everybody leaves those jobs to me.<br>
</p>

<p>
What I'm getting at is bigger than an extensible text editor, or an occupation, or a beloved season. I'm saying it's worth finding your resonant frequency, the node where everything's in phase and you can transmit in the clear without looking over your shoulder. I'm convinced everyone has a sweet spot, and once you find it, goals and competitive measures and key milestones dim down enough that you can enjoy life and handle it well, whatever's happening. It's a place where even silence is a source of pleasant sound for you, where the trunk noise is familiar music and the tone is 20dB down on the nose.<br>
</p>

<p>
To indulge myself in the all-too-obvious, it's a place that's right as rain.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Looking at my list of upcoming articles, I keep seeing the same theme repeated over and over.  A sequence table of Numbers.</p><p> Numbers tables are truly invaluable. I use them all of the time for string manipulation, simulating window functions, populating test tables with lots of data, eliminating cursor logic, and many other tasks that would be incredibly difficult without them.</p><p>Is using a table of numbers a hack, as I’ve seen some people claim? No. Show me another way to efficiently do all of the things a numbers table can. Does it waste space? No. The script below will use up around 900 KB of disk space in each database. That’s absolutely nothing. You’ll end up getting millions, maybe billions of times the disk space investment back in terms of ease of development and time saved.</p><p>So henceforth, I will assume in this blog that everyone reading has a Numbers table. And I will politely link to this article as a gentle reminder. But I want you to open Query Analyzer right now and use the following script:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="sql">USE Model
GO

CREATE TABLE Numbers
(
	Number INT NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT PK_Numbers 
		PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (Number)
		WITH FILLFACTOR = 100
)

INSERT INTO Numbers
SELECT
	(a.Number * 256) + b.Number AS Number
FROM 
	(
		SELECT number
		FROM master..spt_values
		WHERE 
			type = 'P'
			AND number &lt;= 255
	) a (Number),
	(
		SELECT number
		FROM master..spt_values
		WHERE 
			type = 'P'
			AND number &lt;= 255
	) b (Number)
GO
</pre><p>There. Now you automatically have a Numbers table in every database you create, populated with every number between 0 and 65535. That’s big enough for most tasks. If you need more numbers, just insert more! It’s fun and easy! And trust me, you’ll use this table. A lot. And you’ll thank me one day, probably by sending me lots of gifts, as a very small token of your appreciation.</p><p> But in the meantime, here are two links with more information on using a numbers table:</p><p><a target="#" href="http://vyaskn.tripod.com/fun_with_numbers_in_t-sql_queries.htm">Fun with numbers in Transact-SQL queries</a></p><hr><p> <b>Update, December 1, 2005</b>: Fixed the insert script for SQL Server 2005; master..spt_values now has a lot more numbers (0-2048 instead of 0-255) so as-is the script was failing. It should work properly now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><div><h2>Transparent OLEDs <br>(TOLEDs)</h2><p>The first OLED devices were constructed with a metallic cathode, so the light generated in the device exited through the glass substrate (i.e. the anode side of the device). With the invention and development of a transparent cathode, the light can exit through both sides of the device. In addition, when the device is turned off, the device can be transparent.</p><p>Transparent OLED (TOLED) technology enables three key features that have the potential to create a host of new product opportunities.</p><ul><li>Top emission</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Stacking</li></ul><p>Universal Display’s TOLED® technology is based on a proprietary top contact, or cathode, that is optically transparent. In Figure A below, you see typical OLED, where the bottom contact, or anode, consists of a transparent metal oxide film and the top contact consists of a reflective metal. As a result, when light is generated by the OLED, it emits through the bottom transparent surface. TOLEDs, as shown in Figure B, use an optically transparent top cathode, meaning both top and bottom contacts allow light transmission.</p><p>With the same proprietary cathode that is used for transparent OLEDs, TOLED technology can be employed for use in top-emitting OLEDs. In a top emission OLED, as shown in Figure C, the anode and cathode work together to form an optical cavity, emitting light away from the substrate and the backplane, increasing the aperture ratio of the display. This is very good for mobile devices and screens where you can turn the display to ensure the best viewing angle, as it increases the light output and increases display efficiency at normal viewing angles.</p><p><img src="https://oled.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/toled.jpg" alt="toled" width="745" height="877"></p><p>For applications as diverse as architectural windows for home entertainment, retail advertising and illumination, to navigation/warning displays on windshields and heads-up helmet faceshields, TOLED technology can pave the way.</p><ul><li>Transparency: Capable of 70% to 85% transparency when turned off, TOLED pixels are nearly as clear as the glass or plastic substrate on which they are built. When used in an active-matrix OLED configuration, the effective transmission of a TOLED display may, however, be somewhat reduced depending on the resolution of the display and TFT design.</li><li>Bi-directional emission: Typically, the light generated by the TOLED emits from both surfaces. Enhancement films and other optical treatments may be used to direct more of the light in one direction than the other.</li><li>Performance: TOLEDs also offer excellent opto-electronic performance properties, i.e., spectral color emission, luminous efficiency and lifetime – that compare well to those for bottom-emission OLEDs.</li><li> Stacking: Fabricating one OLED on top of another  OLED can be advantageous in terms of improving overall lifetime and also providing a broader range of output color spectrum.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>A rise of data scarcity awareness in analytics has lead to a series of tools that report user behavior with a minimum of collected data. These tools try to hit a sweet-spot of not requiring any user identification (cookies) yet allowing for insights into user behavior. None of these tools would require consent under GDPR (<em>i am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice</em>) and they all (but one) use a time limited identification method such as a hash of ip + user agent + daily random salt.</p><p>Having worked in <a href="https://www.digitalanalyticsassociation.org/">Digital Analytics</a> for more than 10 years, I initially found Simple Analytics and got in touch with its creator Adrian after a discussion on “minimal data” in early 2019 (see below). Since then i’ve found 4 similar tools and tried them all out. Keep reading for more about these Tools, and <a href="https://twitter.com/LukasGrebe">get in touch with me on Twitter (@LukasGrebe)</a> for any feedback!</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tools in alphabetical order</th><th>Pricing in the lowest traffic tier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/lukas-grebe">Fathom</a></td><td>11,67 € / month <em>if billed yearly</em></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a></td><td>5€ / month</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a></td><td>4€ / month <em>if billed yearly</em></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/lukas-grebe">Simple Analytics</a></td><td>9€ / month <em>if billed yearly</em></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/">Netlify Analytics</a></td><td>7,99€ / month</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Netlify Analytics is one of many server-log analytics tools. This one is the Webhosting platform Netlify providing their paying customers a simplified view into their logs</p><p><small>Similar tools i’ve found in the mean time, not coved here: <a href="https://analytics.angelfishstats.com/">https://analytics.angelfishstats.com/</a>, <a href="https://friendly.is/">https://friendly.is/</a>, <a href="https://nibspace.com/">https://nibspace.com</a></small></p><h2 id="implications">Implications</h2><p>A central challenge is tying multiple sessions to a single user without a cookie. No cookie means a big hole in the classic analytics data and a huge set of unknowns when it comes to attribution. These implications are a reason for enhancing or replacing 1990s era server-side log analytics with client-side javascript trackers.<br>However, with a time based salt in identifying a single user and thus explicitly changing IDs to not “track” individual users is new here.</p><h2 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h2><p>Wich of these Tools is <strong>THE BEST</strong> ? As always: what’s best depends on how you define what’s important.</p><p>Lets take a look at these tools in regards to the <a href="https://lukas.grebe.me/digital-analytics/">different areas of digital analytics</a>.</p><h3 id="define">Define</h3><p>„Why measure anything at all?“</p><p>Websites ought to be there for one reason or another. I start the Digital Analytics journey by defining what metrics would be important to look at and reveal more about how visitors are achieving what the website is set out to do!</p><p>Having visitors load your website in their browser is a functional instrument and not the reason for your website to exist. Therefore looking at Page views and Visitors isn’t quite right.</p><p>While Simple Analytics and GoatCounter offer event tracking for arbitrary data points, currently Plausible and Fathom allow configuring goals and showing conversion rates. Plausible allows selecting certain pages or events to be shown as a completed goal. Fathom stands alone (for now) in offering a monetary value.</p><figure><img srcset="https://lukas.grebe.me/assets/images/Screenshot_2020-07-29%20Simple%20Analytics%20-%20Events.png 2x" src="https://lukas.grebe.me/assets/images/Screenshot_2020-07-29%20Simple%20Analytics%20-%20Events.png" alt="Simple Analytics Event analysis"><figcaption>Simple Analytics Event Analysis stands out! You can freely order events on a single page and Simple Analytics will output a conversion rate of the given order.</figcaption></figure><p>With a simple set of customizations, the complexity of defining what needs to be measured seems trivial compared to the classic tool such as Google or Adobe analytics that allow slicing, dicing and drilling down into hundreds of dimensions, Metrics, Segments and Cohorts. But again, simplicity <strong>is</strong> the selling point of these tools:</p><ul><li>“Easy; if you’ve been confused by the myriad of options and flexibility of Google Analytics and Matomo that you don’t need then GoatCounter will be a breath of fresh air.”</li><li>“without deep layers of menus”</li><li>“stop scrolling through pages of reports and collecting gobs of personal data about your visitors, both of which you probably don’t need.”</li></ul><h3 id="capture">Capture</h3><p>Once we’ve defined what we want to measure and why, the second part of the analytics foundation is capturing data and making it accessible in a single-point-of-truth system. This could be your data warehouse or your analytics platform of choice.</p><p>I’ll leave out topics such as tag management, data governance, (data warehouse) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract%2C_transform%2C_load">ETL</a>, solution design reference and other documentation, and let’s look at the data captured:</p><p>Theres <strong>acquisition data</strong> defaulting to Referrer data from the browser and tracking parameters in the URL’s query string. GoatCounter, Simple Analytics and Plausible overwrite the referrer with data from any of the query string parameters <code>ref</code>, <code>source</code> or <code>utm_source</code>. Fathom and Netlify is more conservative in overwriting but Fathom does provide a JavaScript API to change the referrer in a custom page view call.</p><p>I’d like to see this expanded by all tools. Providing a second dimension to the acquisition <code>source</code>, such as <code>creative</code> would be powerful addition for a differentiated analysis. Overwriting the referrer works, but it removes any deeper look for example when the display ad campaign link gets posted to social media.</p><p>Beautiful tidbits: Plausible allows you to see your google search console data right within its UI. If google is the search engine of your target market, this is great as you can see what people search to find your site. Along with Simple Analytics, it also shows you the original tweet instead of <a href="http://t.co/">t.co</a> referrer data.</p><p>As for <strong>behavioral data</strong> - what people do on the site - all tools provide a list of about 4 Dimensions: <code>Content or page viewed</code>, <code>location or country</code>, <code>device type / size</code>, <code>browser</code> and sometimes <code>operating system</code> combined with the two to three Metrics <code>Views</code>, <code>Uniques</code>, and for some tools <code>bounces</code> and <code>time on page</code>.<br>From an Analysts perspective the documentation can be opaque as to how these metrics are calculated and displayed. „Is that 85 phone size <em>visits</em> or <em>views</em> and what <em>is</em> phone size?“, “Do events and Goals extend time on page or are they non interactive?” But it honestly does not matter as the information provided by the data would not change much either way. GoatCounter created a great rundown of the different <a href="https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter/blob/master/docs/sessions.markdown">„unique“ calculations</a> of each tool.</p><p>The different values for device type / Size are all derived from screen size:</p><ul><li>fathom: phone, desktop, tablet</li><li>goatcounter: phone, large phone and small tablet, tablets and small laptops, computer monitor, computer monitor larger than HD</li><li>plausible: desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile</li><li>simpleanalytics: seems to be broken at point of writing.</li></ul><p>Again two additional tidbits: Netlify Analytics shows you requests that resulted in a 404-not found error and the bandwidth used. Fathom includes free uptime monitoring with alerts via eMail, Slack, Discord, SMS or Telegram Bot if your site goes down. Neat and then you realize how important bot detection is because the uptime Pings show up as thousands of pageviews in netlify analyitcs.</p><p>The <strong>Outcome</strong> category of captured data should reflect the €s earned. Interestingly enough, none of these tools but Fathom provide an explicit tracking of (monetary) values through their goal or event Tracking! I’d love to see this added to the other tools and thanks to this Article, Plausible has <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/issues/256">added it to their issue tracker</a>!</p><h3 id="report-%26-analyse">Report &amp; Analyse</h3><p>Given the cardinality or “size” of the data available, its one page reports all the way down. There’s not much to configure besides the date. GoatCounter, Simple Analytics and Plausible have filtered views for individual pages or goals. GoatCounter and Plausible <a href="https://twitter.com/PlausibleHQ/status/1286590279731077121">now supports a drilldown of referal sources</a>. All tools provide a deep-link to copy &amp; share or bookmark for any report configuration.

It has a higher <a href="https://thedoublethink.com/tuftes-principles-for-visualizing-quantitative-information/">data density and more meaningful ink</a> thanks to showing data on an hourly basis. Though i have to admit that Elon Musk is right in „Things have to look cool if you want people to care“ and frankly plausible and fathom look most professional in their presentation.</p><p>When sharing data with other parties, Fathom and Plausible provide an option to send email reports to any third party or protecting reports with a <del><a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/eigdbwpc/lukas.grebe.me">simple password</a>(hello)</del> and for plausible even an explicit <a href="https://plausible.io/share/SQYCxVdo6kpstJBYuIjRl">shared link</a> that can be revoked. These options are great for sharing data within the organization or external parties. That would be nice to see in other three Tools where you’re stuck with a single set of Login credentials, or a <del><a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/lukas.grebe.me">public link</a></del> to the dashboard.</p><p>Simple Analytics appears to be alone in offering a stats API to create custom dashboards, integrating into other reporting tools, or the like.</p><h4 id="cross-filtering-the-data">Cross-filtering the data</h4><p>I wonder why <strong>none of these tools have implemented <a href="http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/">cross-filtering</a></strong> the data yet! The Use-case is ideal here and would make an amazing drill down into the data set. It’s even available out of the box with <a href="https://vega.github.io/">Vega</a> and other visualization frameworks. I’ve created a little demo of this:</p><section><article><a href="https://vega.github.io/editor/#/gist/681476b574aebd61e468d20726690917/spec.json"><figure><img src="https://lukas.grebe.me/assets/images/crossfilter-3.gif" alt="short clip of cross-filtering two charts"><figcaption>Feel free to Play with this cross-filter on a goatcounter export in the Vega Editor!</figcaption></figure></a></article></section><p>The entire dataset fits in memory and allows for a really smooth analysis. This should be expanded across all dimensions.</p><h3 id="test">Test</h3><p>Essential for a data-driven approach to improvement is a formal hypothesis testing when making changes. The idea is to rule out the influence of external changes on the metrics you’re watching. If the Analytics tool „understands“ testing, analyzing the impact of changes becomes a breeze. I don’t mean a fully fledged A/B testing tool that decides wich variations a visitor sees and all sorts of other things. The only requirement is to have a dimension (just like browser, or referrer) to filter usage data by and thus create a segment for visitors that experienced a specific test variation.</p><p>None of these Tools make that process easy, but it can be done with workarounds.</p><p>Fathom and GoatCounter allow creating a second tracking code for a single site, Plausible and Simple Analytics don’t but you could use event Tracking. If Segmenting for test variations (see above) isn’t an option you need at least 4 numbers: Visits to Variation and Controls, and „Success events“ for both.</p><h3 id="predict">Predict</h3><p>Predicting any metric with these tools is going to be a manual job.

<h3><strong>Wearing a doctoral hat</strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jyu.fi/fi/akateemiset-tapahtumat/promootio/ohjeet/Kulkue_t.jpg" alt="An Academic Procession in the Conferment Degree Ceremony" title="Promootiokulkue">All doctors participating in the Act of Conferment are recommended to wear a doctoral hat. However, it is obligatory only for doctors to be conferred. The hat is used in the day and evening events of the conferment day. In the Act of Conferment, the hat is brought to the auditorium in the left hand, the lyre pointing forward. The hat is put on at the same time with the Conferrer of Degrees. Newly conferred doctors also wear the hat at the Dinner and Ball. For other doctors this is decided separately.</p>
<p>The Conferment of Degrees Ceremony at the University of Jyväskylä also includes a church service. There are no clear rules on using doctoral hats in churches.&nbsp; However, the Conferment of Degrees Committee has decided that all doctors take their hats off during the church service.</p>
<p>The doctoral hat is a symbol of degree and status, and should be handled accordingly. For example, it is not allowed to place the hat upside down on a table. The best place for storing the hat is in a dedicated hat box.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting a doctoral hat</strong></h3>
<p>The hat must fit well on the head. To ensure this, doctoral hats are always tailor-made. All doctor promovendi may purchase the hat directly from a desired manufacturer.</p>

<h3><strong>Hat model and colour&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The Finnish doctoral hat resembles a top hat. A golden emblem is attached to the velvet ribbon of the hat. Traditionally the hat is black, green, red or purple, but different disciplines may have specific colours. The hat colour at the University of Jyväskylä is black, excluding the Faculty of Sport and Health Studies where it is dark blue.</p>
<p>The emblem of the hat is defined carefully for different disciplines and universities. Traditionally the emblem for the doctors of philosophy and psychology at the University of Jyväskylä is a lyre encircled by laurels. Usually hat manufacturers are aware of the emblems of different universities and disciplines.</p>

It comes with a scabbard, a black or golden scabbard holder and the golden emblem of the University. The total length of the sword is 87 centimetres, the blade being 75 centimetres. The weight of the sword is 730 grams (1.6 pounds).</p>
<p>The sword is traditionally carried on the left side. Men carry the sword in the scabbard holder, which is attached to a firm loop sewn into trousers. A catch on the holder keeps the sword firmly in its place. <em>(Click the image to enlarge.)</em></p>
<p>Female doctors should also have a sword. In most cases, the sword cannot be directly attached to dresses because the material is not strong enough. For carrying the sword, ladies’ outfits for the conferment day should include a belt or other similar aid that matches the outfit. The sword can be attached creatively, for example, by wearing the belt under the skirt and taking out some of the seam. In a two-piece outfit, the fastening can be hidden under the top. If it is unreasonably difficult to modify the outfit, the sword can also be carried in the left hand.</p>

However, we cannot guarantee the availability of hats and swords to borrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately we don't have any swords to be borrowed at the moment (May 2019).&nbsp;</em>One can also ask e.g. his/her supervisor or someone else at the faculty if someone could lend the sword.</p>
<h2><strong>The transportation of the sword in an airplane</strong></h2>
<p>Swords are transported in the cargo hold as registered luggage. The sword should be packed properly, preferably in their own transport box or package. The sword has to be reported in the check-in and it will go on record. These procedures belong to normal airport routines. More information is available at the check-in of the Helsinki-Vantaa airport: <a title="Finavia" href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/helsinki-airport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-linktype="external" data-val="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/helsinki-airport">https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/helsinki-airport</a></p></div>

                    <p>Wouldn't it be great if you could dream up an application and have it running live without writing any code at all? What would you dare to build if given such a tool?</p><p>The Dreamup is an idea for a codeless alternative to the World Wide Web. You can read the full paper on my website <a href="https://www.antipa.io/The-Dreamup.pdf">in pdf form</a> and checkout my github projects <a href="https://github.com/scottyantipa/tranX/tree/add-html-lang">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scottyantipa/dreamuppin">here</a> . <strong> </strong>In this blog post I'll &nbsp;just touch on the basics and pull some excerpts from that paper. The purpose of this proposal is to lay out an idea for what the Dreamup could look like, present some initial technical findings, and get feedback from the community.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>The Dreamup is a concept for creating and deploying software applications. The main purpose, and difference from the Web, is that applications aren't defined in code. Instead, author's will use ordinary language, pictures, and other media to describe how they want their app to look and behave.</p><p>For example, a Dreamup app could be a single text file with the words "On a black background put the words 'Hi there!' in white text, in the center of the screen". A user will experience this app by visiting it using a new kind of browser -- a Dreamup browser -- that is capable of interpreting human language to generate an application <em>in real time</em>. The browser can look at the text file and understand what the author is trying to describe. It will paint the screen black, and draw 'Hello there!' in white text in the center.</p><p>The Dreamup is an open network, not a company, just like the Web. Anyone who wants to participate can create apps on the Dreamup and no one has the authority to dictate how the Dreamup should evolve.</p><h2 id="an-example-app">An Example App</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.antipa.io/content/images/2018/12/diagram.png"><figcaption>Dreamup network diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The diagram above is showing how a user would experience a simple Dreamup app. The "File System" in the diagram is showing the structure of the files on the author's server. Note that there is no code. The author only needs a couple of images, and an instructions.txt where they describe the behavior of the app.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.antipa.io/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-5.19.53-PM.png"><figcaption>Files on the author's computer</figcaption></figure><p>This is just one small example of what someone may want to do with the Dreamup. As the name suggests, the goal will be to support any type of digital experience that you could imagine.</p><h2 id="how">How</h2><p>Most likely machine learning, or other forms of artificial intelligence, will be the technology used to make the Dreamup possible. Machine learning models will be developed and trained to look at these natural language applications and produce the code necessary to generate the desired experience. This translation will need to happen in near real-time to not keep the user waiting. There are many ongoing attempts at generating various types of code from natural language, <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-3">OpenAI’s GPT-3</a> being a recent impressive one.</p><p>Given the state of the art of today’s machine learning research the initial applications on the Dreamup will likely need to be quite simple. However, simple applications can still be fun and magical and entice people to explore this new landscape.</p><h2 id="my-experimentation">My Experimentation</h2><p>I have begun experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/scottyantipa/tranX/tree/add-html-lang">a natural language to html model</a> based off of a fork from Pengcheng Yin and Graham Neubig's project TranX. With about 6 thousand source examples I generated with Amazon Mechanical Turk, the model can produce HTML &lt;video /&gt; tags from natural language sentences. For example:</p><p><strong><em>The source of the video is “election.mp4”. The poster image is found at “video.jpg”. Make it automatically play. 75% for the height.</em></strong></p><pre><code>&lt;video autoplay poster="video.jpg" src="election.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre><p><strong><em>Use the video from “according.mp4”. The poster image should be from “owner.png”. Have it play by itself. The sounds need to be muted.</em></strong></p><pre><code>&lt;video autoplay muted poster="owner.png" src="according.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre><p>The accuracy isn't yet spectacular, but getting there.</p><h2 id="next">Next</h2><p>This proposal is meant to initiate a conversation and inspire development of the Dreamup . There are still unanswered questions about the technical implementations of the Dreamup. </p><p>If you're interested in working on this, please reach out and also checkout <a href="https://www.antipa.io/The-Dreamup.pdf">the full paper</a>.</p><p>Scott Antipa</p><p>scott@antipa.io</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Querying materialized views, unlike querying tables or logical views, can reduce query costs by maintaining results in memory that are only updated when necessary. To learn more, check out the rest of the post!</p>
<h2><b>The Cost of Querying</b></h2>
<p>Each time you query a database you incur some cost. Your database will parse, validate, plan, optimize, and execute your query, using up wall clock time, CPU time, memory, opportunity cost, and, potentially, actual dollars. As you grow your application, you will likely wonder how you can reduce these costs.</p>
<p>To dig into this, let’s look at an example. Imagine you work at a company that sells widgets. Each time a widget is sold, you record some purchase information in a <code>purchase</code> table that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="177" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-768x301.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-2048x802.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-768x301.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-2048x802.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>With this data, you can answer questions that are critical to your business: what’s our best selling widget? Which widgets need to be shipped today? And, the evergreen question: how much money have we made?</p>
<p>Each of these questions can be answered by querying the <code>purchase</code> table directly. For example, you could calculate your total revenue with the following query:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="107" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1024x242.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-768x182.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1536x363.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-2048x484.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1024x242.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-768x182.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1536x363.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-2048x484.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>When this query is run, your database will scan each row of the <code>purchase</code> table to aggregate the values in the <code>amount</code> column. Your database will have spent <code>X</code> resources to return your result. (As mentioned before, <code>X</code> is comprised of wall clock time, CPU time, memory, opportunity cost, and dollars.)</p>
<p>The good news is you’re happy to pay <code>X</code> because this information is important and valuable to your business. <strong>The bad news is that you will pay <code>X</code> each time</strong> <strong>your query is run</strong>. Because queries against tables and views do not reference previous results, they are forced to completely recalculate their results each time.<b></b></p>
<p>You might be wondering: is this a big deal? If your query is exploratory, ad hoc, or infrequent, it’s probably not. But what if you suddenly needed to calculate total revenue once an hour instead of once a day? Or once a second?</p>

<p>Suddenly, even a small <code>X</code> starts to feel expensive. As your queries are run more frequently, process more data, or perform more complex computation, these costs may even feel prohibitive. So, what can you do instead?</p>
<h2><b>Materialized Views</b></h2>
<p>Unlike queries that calculate their results from tables and views, queries that read from materialized views do not recalculate their results each time. To understand why, let’s create a materialized view together.</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="102" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1024x215.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-768x161.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1536x323.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-2048x430.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1024x215.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-768x161.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1536x323.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-2048x430.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>When this statement is executed, your database will run your query once to calculate the result. Then, it will physically store that result in a newly created database object — in our case an object named <code>total_revenue</code>. Now when you query <code>total_revenue</code>, your database will return the results stored in <code>total_revenue</code> without performing any additional computation.</p>

<p>This means that unlike querying a view directly, you only pay the cost of your query once when creating a materialized view.* Future queries will pay some constant cost <code>1</code> to read from <code>total_revenue</code>, instead of <code>X</code>.</p>
<p>This seems like a perfect solution for our problem, so what’s the catch? Why don’t we use materialized views for everything?</p>
<h2><b>Two Catches*</b></h2>
<p>The first catch is that you pay for materialized views with memory. While materialized views physically storing prior results reduces your query cost from <code>X</code> to <code>1</code>, it also requires memory that was not required to simply query a table or a logical view.</p>
<p>The second, trickier catch surfaces when a new purchase is added to the <code>purchase</code> table. To illustrate, let’s walk through this scenario together.</p>

<p>Noticing that we have a new sale in our <code>purchase</code> table, we query our materialized view for our updated total revenue. But, we get back our old value. What gives?</p>

<p>When we created our materialized view, our database ran our query once to store the results in <code>total_revenue</code>. However, since the query was run&nbsp;<em>before</em> the newest purchase was added to the <code>purchase</code> table, the result calculated and stored in <code>total_revenue</code> does not take this new purchase into account. To update the result to include new purchases, you will have to&nbsp;<strong>refresh</strong> the materialized view. Generally, there are two mechanisms for refreshing materialized views: complete refreshes or incremental refreshes.</p>
<p>Complete refreshes rerun the query underlying a materialized view to completely recalculate and replace the stored results. Just like queries against tables and views, every complete refresh will cost <code>X</code>. To complicate matters, you will have to decide <em>when</em> to perform a refresh: when someone queries the view? Once an hour? Once a week? You will want to choose a cadence that does not force the database to do unnecessary work. For example, you don’t want to pay <code>X</code> recompute <code>total_revenue</code> if there are no new purchases. In real world systems, users will have to choose a refresh schedule that maintains a careful balance between data freshness requirements and acceptable query costs.</p>
<p>By contrast, incremental refreshes keep materialized views up to date by only performing work only on data that has changed. To return to our example, instead of rescanning each row of the <code>purchase</code> table to calculate the sum, an incrementally maintained materialized view would only do the following work:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="214" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-768x365.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1536x730.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-2048x973.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-768x365.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1536x730.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-2048x973.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>This means that instead of paying <code>X</code> to refresh the view, your database will only pay a fraction of <code>X</code> proportional to the size of the changed data. And, because this refresh mechanism is triggered by changes in the underlying data, you can be certain that your database is refreshing your view no more than necessary. In our example, <code>total_revenue</code> will only be updated when a row in the <code>purchase</code> table is inserted, updated, or deleted.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Creating and maintaining a materialized view can reduce the query costs paid for expensive or frequently run queries. However, the potential cost reduction of a materialized view greatly depends on its underlying refresh mechanism. Only incremental refreshes can reduce the per-refresh cost of maintaining a materialized view while also ensuring that views are updated no more than necessary.</p>
<p>While incremental refreshes are available in a handful of databases, they often come with a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DWHSG/basicmv.htm#GUID-505C24CF-5D56-4820-88AA-2221410950E7">long list of restrictions</a>. At the moment, Materialize is the only system that supports incremental maintained materialized views without restriction.

<p>The evening of June 13, 2020, was like any other for Raya Sharbain: filled with online distractions. Sharbain, a program coordinator at Jordan Open Source Association, was browsing social media when news of an Egyptian woman’s suicide flooded her feeds. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/16/sarah-hegazi-egypt-pride-flag-suicide/">Sarah Hegazi</a>, a lesbian activist who had been imprisoned by Egyptian authorities after waving a rainbow flag at a concert, had taken her own life after a long battle with PTSD. </p>



<p>Two days later, Sharbain, who edits Wikipedia pages in her free time, went to Hegazi’s page. Her last name had been spelled incorrectly, so Sharbain fixed the mistake. She clicked on the Arabic version of the page and noticed the activist’s cause of death was listed as “murder,” even though reputable outlets were reporting it as suicide. Sharbain opened the edit tab once more. Suddenly, the entire page was nominated for deletion by other editors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a collaborative encyclopedia, Wikipedia is technically an open-access platform, but its community of Arabic language editors is an increasing source of controversy. Critics say the fate of Hegazi’s page — which remained deleted at the time of this article’s publication — is part of a greater culture of conservatism that pervades Arabic Wikipedia, making it difficult for Wikipedians to post about subjects seen as taboo in Arab society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The gatekeepers</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Hosted by the California-based <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, Wikipedia relies on volunteer editors, who can apply for administrative authority once they’ve gained the trust of their respective communities. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator">admins</a> effectively function as gatekeepers to Wikipedia posts: they can block or unblock accounts, protect pages from edits, and delete, revive, or rename pages without restriction.</p>



<p>Wikipedia articles exist in more than 300 languages, each with its own community of editors and administrators. For Arabic Wikipedians, editing and posting content can be uniquely challenging. Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, Arabic readers face a huge disparity when it comes to online content. Some estimate that only <a href="https://www.communicateonline.me/in-depth/why-arabic-content-creation-is-a-major-business-opportunity-for-content-creators/">3% of the internet is written</a> in Arabic. Arabic Wikipedia, which averaged some <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/ar.wikipedia.org">300 million views</a> a month in the first half of this year, exhibits similar disparities. In 2018, Hebrew Wikipedia had <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/Sitemap.htm">108</a> editors per million speakers. Arabic Wikipedia had two. This lack of manpower has resulted in a smaller group of admins too: while Arabic Wikipedia has <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">26</a> admins, Icelandic, for example, has <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">28</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>In 2018, Hebrew Wikipedia had&nbsp;108&nbsp;editors per million speakers. Arabic Wikipedia had two.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The limited number of Arabic editors and administrators has resulted in an environment that, some critics say, is closed off or even hostile to newcomers who seek to edit and create posts about controversial subjects. Samir El Sharbaty, a Cairo-based brand associate at Wikimedia Foundation, says Arabic Wikipedia suffers from more gender bias than Wikipedia in other languages. “It has a long way to go in order to reach a better level of representation and neutrality,” he says. Afek Ben Chahed, the only woman in the <a href="https://meta.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Arab_Wikimedians_Committee?fbclid=IwAR02ue2cBQYRR_VhM3eWU5jWwTOeIki4ivfJdyNNdxo_ygUvOzNkSZ2jwJo">Arab Wikimedians Committee</a>, says many of the admins appear to have a conservative or religious bias.</p>



<p>For Sharbain, who has organized multiple edit-a-thons and workshops with Wikipedia and Wikidata across the United Kingdom and Jordan, editing articles about topics that interest her is uniquely satisfying. She likes to create entries for her favorite Arabic alternative bands, upload pictures she’s taken of landscapes or concerts, and edit English Wikipedias about Jordinian politics. She says Hegazi is an important person to document because her story is testament to the brutality of the Egyptian government, which tends not to be well-documented in the Middle East. Including Hegazi in the encyclopedia ensures her legacy.</p>



<h3><strong>Notability criteria&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Hegazi, a 30-year-old software developer, committed suicide after being imprisoned, sexually assaulted, and electrocuted for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/16/sarah-hegazi-egypt-pride-flag-suicide/">three months</a> in an Egyptian prison. Her ordeal began in September 2017 after she waved a rainbow flag during a performance by the Lebanese alternative rock band Mashrou’ Leila, whose frontman is openly gay. The band’s strong stance on sexuality — <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/inside-egypts-lgbt-crackdown-one-bands-story-197835/">their songs openly address gender and politics</a> — has sparked backlash in many Arab countries. Their concert in Cairo marked a turning point: within days, an image of Hegazi smiling with a rainbow flag had circulated on social media, and the<strong> </strong>country’s musicians’ syndicate banned Mashrou’ Leila from entering Egypt. Authorities used the moment to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/30/egypt-stop-anti-lgbt-crackdown-intimidation">launch one of the biggest crackdowns</a> on the country’s LGBTIQ community in years, arresting dozens of concertgoers on “debauchery” charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://madamasr.com/en/2020/06/15/opinion/u/a-year-after-the-rainbow-flag-controversy/">After</a> her release from prison in early 2018, Hegazi lost her job, left her family, and fled to Canada, where she sought asylum. She continued to write about her struggles with PTSD, anxiety, and trauma, but the turmoil of her ordeal weighed on her. “To the world,” Hegazi wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/nadeenhaidar/status/1272285954062123009">in a final letter</a>, “you were cruel to a great extent, but I forgive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharbain, whose hair is short and closely cropped like Hegazi’s, was upset by the deletion of her page, midedit, at first. But when she joined the “talk page,” where volunteer editors discuss issues with articles, she saw editors and admins debating whether Hegazi had warranted an entry to begin with. Sharbain commented that Hegazi met the “notability” criteria, which are among the requirements for individuals to receive biographies on Wikipedia. She initially thought that the discussion was a vote, so she called on her fellow Wikipedian friends to join in (23 voted in favor of keeping the article deleted; 18 voted to republish it), but later she realized that the final decision was made by one administrator. On June 22, a week after Hegazi’s death, an administrator with the username Dr-Taher sent a note: “Delete. Thank you all.”</p>



<p>Now, if you search for “Sarah Hegazi” on Arabic Wikipedia, the site yields no results (though the Arabic-language sidebar of Hegazi’s English Wikipedia page redirects you to a short paragraph about her suicide on a page about LGBTIQ rights in Egypt). For Sharbain and other Wikipedians, it was difficult to ignore editors’ obsession with whether Hegazi was notable enough to merit her own entry in Arabic. Even after Dr-Taher deleted her page, the fight to republish it continued in Facebook Wikipedia groups. Sharbain told <em>Rest of World</em> that when one commenter asked who Hegazi was, “Another editor derisively responded, ‘The atheist who killed herself.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michel Bakni, an administrator and a top editor at Wikipedia, insists that the deletion of Hegazi’s biography had nothing to do with admin bias. Bakni says the matter was simple: she didn’t cross the threshold for notability. As for how Hegazi became eligible for an English Wikipedia post, he notes that each Wikipedia community manages itself; “eligibility” does not mean the same thing for English Wikipedia and its Arabic counterpart.</p>



<p>But the criteria for notability within Arabic Wikipedia remains subjective. Last year, a similar debate among Wikipedians occured after <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1548306/middle-east">Israa Ghareeb</a>, a 21-year-old Palestinian makeup artist from the West Bank, was reportedly murdered by members of her family in an apparent honor killing after posting a story on Instagram with her soon-to-be fiancé. Although thousands protested her murder after the news went viral, admins said she didn’t meet the criteria for a Wikipedia post. And yet <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A_%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%B4">Shady Habash,</a> an Egyptian filmmaker who was imprisoned for mocking Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and died in jail earlier this year, was deemed worthy by admins. Habash’s demise mirrors Hegazi’s: their deaths were the result of the same authoritarian regime, but only one appears on Arabic Wikipedia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Visibility online and offline&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The availability of accurate Arabic LGBTIQ content online, especially for those who are part of the community in these countries, is often a deciding factor in how others view them. “By removing her biography, Wikipedia is erasing what she went through and the reasons that led to her suicide,” says one queer Lebanese woman, who asked to remain anonymous for her safety. But Majd Al-Shihabi, a Tech Exchange Fellow at SMEX, an Arab digital-rights group, says the debate itself is a start. “Wikipedia is about how we understand ourselves as a society,” he says. According to Al-Shihabi, documenting these battles could push the online Arabic-language ecosystem forward.</p>



<p>Arabic Wikipedia admins remain firm in their resolve to keep Hegazi off the site. The debate between editors and admins, which is still visible within Wikipedia’s edits, makes their views on Hegazi’s legacy clear. “Hegazi has no achievements, prizes, or works,” said <a href="https://ar.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A7:%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B4_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B0%D9%81/%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9_%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A">one admin</a>. “She’s just a girl who raised a flag at a party, was arrested, became forgotten, then committed suicide.” But even without Arabic Wikipedia, Hegazi’s Wikipedia entry exists in 18 other languages.</p>

                    <p><em><em>This is the </em>second instalment of my<em> 'How I built' trilogy detailing the build process of all 3 of my clusters.</em> Read the first <a href="https://ikarus.sg/how-i-built-octopi">here</a>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://ikarus.sg/content/images/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://ikarus.sg/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 600w, https://ikarus.sg/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 1000w, https://ikarus.sg/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 1600w, https://ikarus.sg/content/images/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Where you are in the cluster timeline</figcaption></figure><h2 id="octopains">Octo<em>pains</em></h2><p>In October 2018, more than a year after <a href="https://ikarus.sg/how-i-built-octopi/">building my first cluster Octopi</a>, I had officially outgrown the cluster. I started noticing the performance bottlenecks started when I tried to run Wordpress on it, where a single page load of a newly installed Wordpress blog takes about <strong>10 seconds!</strong> Nevertheless, all that was unsurprising given the measly single-core 700MHz processor on each node.</p><p>At that point in time, I've graduated from university then and secured a job as a Data Scientist + Full-Stack Engineer at a startup and I thought to myself:</p><blockquote>What better a time to build myself a new cluster?</blockquote><h2 id="kraken">Kraken</h2><p>The second cluster was named <em>Kraken</em>.</p><blockquote>The <strong>kraken</strong> (/ˈkrɑːkən/)[1] is a legendary cephalopod-like sea monster of gigantic size in Scandinavian folklore. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken">Wikipedia</a>)</blockquote><p>The Kraken is basically a much bigger and monstrous octopus, hence the name, symbolizing an evolution of the first cluster. It was built out of 7 Raspberry Pi 3Bs powered by a single USB charger. </p><p>With my first pay check, I had initially intended to <em>finally</em> build a cluster of 8 nodes but once again I was unable to realize this <em>cursed</em> idea. The maximum number of ports on a consumer-grade network switch was 8, enough for 7 nodes and a cable to the router. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

Raspberry Pi 3Bs run on the <em>armv7</em> &nbsp;CPU architecture, which happens to be the current lowest common denominator among Arm processors today. </p><p>Latest Arm processors (<em>arm64</em>) are backward-compatible with all code written and compiled on <em>armv7</em>. In contrast, <em>arm64 </em>processors are not backward-compatible with <em>armv6</em> processors (Raspberry Pi 1 and 2), so they are essentially in the process of being phased out from the community.</p><p>Secondly, this cluster would be perfect for most but the most bandwidth demanding applications, from hosting your own blog, file sync service, media library managers, link-shorteners, note-taking applications and so on. The only time it would not perform as intended is when your application demands heavy sustained writes, such as when encoding videos, given the USB 2.0 bus bottlenecks in the Raspberry Pi 3, which is resolved only in Raspberry Pi 4.</p><p>All in all, building a Raspberry Pi 3 cluster is, in my opinion, the most cost-effective way of learning Docker and clustering in general, and will remain so in the foreseeable future. So if you are just getting into Docker, I'd highly recommend this build.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><p>In my next post in this series, I shall introduce the <em>Leviathan</em> cluster which I have built specifically for high I/O applications, capable of real-time video transcoding and streaming of HEVC -&gt; h264 videos.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love the book Rich Dad Poor Dad. It was my fav growing up. Since then, I've founded several startups, was employee #3 at a $65m VC firm in SF, and realized that there is a similar phenomenon to what Robert Kiyosaki is talking about in Rich Dad Poor Dad currently occurring in Silicon Valley.</p><p>‍</p><p>Let's tastefully call this phenomenon: <strong>Rich Founder Poor Founder.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>The point of entrepreneurship is freedom. Yes it’s to build cool shit and innovate and all that, but at the end of the day the sort of person who becomes an entrepreneur is usually doing it because they want freedom to control their day and work on the things they care about.</p><p>‍</p><p>A lot of people go out and start their first business and try to make it a venture backed startup. That’s the wrong move. That’s like going to the gym and trying to bench 250 lbs on day one. It’s not that you can’t build up to that, it’s just not the right move today. I think the right move is to start a business that can make you $100k+ per year in profit. It doesn’t matter if it can’t scale past that, it’s about building that foundation to give you the freedom to try new things. Fail at those new things and it doesn’t matter as you have that financial foundation. It could be something as simple as a consulting or a services business, or a digital product like a course, newsletter or subscription podcast. Anything that is high margin, simple and enabled by the internet.</p><p>‍</p><p>VC’s may shit on lifestyle businesses but at the end of the day they collect a 2% yearly management fee regardless of their success and typically have a great lifestyle (once their fund size is above $100m AUM).</p><p>‍</p><p>Ask yourself what’s an easier path to wealth and freedom?</p><p>‍</p><p>‍<strong>Path 1: Venture backed startup</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>90% chance of $0.</p><p>‍</p><p>Small personal income until scale, IPO or liquidity event.</p><p>‍</p><p>Massive dilution. Most founders end up owning 5%-20%. $500m market cap = $25m-$100m for founder(s).</p><p>‍</p><p>OR</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Path 2: Lifestyle business</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>50% - 75% chance of success.</p><p>‍</p><p>Pay yourself whatever you want out of profits over time.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you can bootstrap your way to $300k/yr in profit and invest half of that ($150k/yr) at 10%/yr for 20 years = $9.6m + $150k/yr salary to enjoy your life with your family and friends. After 20 years, you can choose to sell that business or automate it and let it ride but with $9.6m invested in a conservative portfolio paying out 5% annually = $480k/year in interest or $40k/mo for you to live off without ever touching the principal nor sacrificing quality of life.</p></div><div><p>‍</p><p><strong>The definition of rich</strong> is having passive income that’s greater than your burn. I’m pretty sure we can all comfortably live off $40k/mo without ever having to leave the house.</p><p>‍</p><p>But wait this isn’t a fair analysis as venture backed startups typically reach scale or a liquidity event in 10 years and you did 20 years for the lifestyle business. Fair, I’m sure after 10 years most of us can comfortably live off $20k ish/mo without ever having to work or touch the principal investment.</p><p>‍</p><p>Most entrepreneurs start with one goal in mind: freedom. If you value freedom, you should have one goal for your first company, and that’s to build a lifestyle business that can produce $100k+/yr of personal income. It can be boring and it doesn’t have to scale. It sets yourself up for the foreseeable future and then you can afford to take big swings. Forget startups. Forget venture capital. Build something that gets you in the game and makes you a living first.‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I think VCs may underestimate the extent to which mainstream entrepreneurship is a key input to outliers and moonshots. So many successful billionaire founders had a “never worry about rent again” moment via an exit in a much more boring business before swinging for a home run.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> — before sending rockets into space and revolutionizing the auto-industry, Elon Musk was broke building Zip2 (online city guides for newspapers) before he netted $22m on the sale. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/how-elon-musk-founded-zip2-with-his-brother-kimbal.html">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Patrick &amp; John Collison</strong> — built Auctimatic: auction management software for small Ebay sellers, and sold it for $5m before going on to found Stripe, valued at $36b. <a href="https://www.startupgrind.com/blog/the-collison-brothers-and-story-behind-the-founding-of-stripe/">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Mark Cuban</strong> — Before building and selling<a href="http://broadcast.com/"> Broadcast.com</a> for $5.7b and buying the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban built a services business called MicroSolutions and sold it for $6m. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> — now worth $60b, Mike Bloomberg had a nice “never think about rent again” exit at 39 when Salomon was acquired by Phibro in 1981; he received $10 million. Bloomberg said “The Salomon Brothers did me the two greatest favours in my life. They hired me and they fired me.” <a href="https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1277633665099595776">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong> — Spotify isn’t Ek’s first success. Daniel Ek became a self-made millionaire at age 23, before even putting a single thought into Spotify. At 23, Daniel Ek “retired” after he sold his online marketing company Advertigo to Swedish digital marketing firm TradeDoubler in a deal worth $1.25 million.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Alex Tew</strong> — started the <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a> to raise money for his university education. He sold 1 million pixels on a 1000 x 1000 pixel grid on his website for $1 per pixel. He ended up making $1,037,100 USD before founding the billion dollar meditation app, <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Austin Allred</strong> — co-authored the growth hacking textbook <em>Secret Sauce</em>, which became a best-seller and provided him the personal seed money to build Lambda School, valued over $150m.</p><p>‍</p><p>And countless others: Ev Williams (Blogger), Pincus (freeloader, support.com, tribe), Travis Kalanick (Red Swoosh), Stewart Butterfield (Flickr), Jason Fried &amp; DHH (37 Signals services business) etc.</p><p>‍</p><p>All of these entrepreneurs built more of a lifestyle business or had a smaller liquidity event before they built a rocket (figuratively and literally for Elon). There is no greater security than knowing that no matter what risks you take, you have a business or enough cash in the bank to pay for your livelihood.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you start by building a lifestyle business it will force you to build a product or offer a service that customers actually want. It forces you to create a monetization plan and it forces you to build a real business. By starting a lifestyle business it forces you to create something you’re passionate about and build an actual business that will actually help attract VC if that’s the path you choose to go down.</p><p>‍</p><p>Renowned value investor and Warren Buffett mentor, Ben Graham, once said: “In the short-run, the stock market is a voting machine. But in the long-run, it is a weighing machine.” AKA in the short term the market may value hype and narrative, but in the long term it always values real traction, revenue, earnings and margins.</p><p>‍</p><p>We’re seeing this play out in the venture market today. In the last few years you may have heard startups raising at eyebrow lifting valuations and hiring large masses of employees. But behind the curtain their P&amp;L is fucked! They have little to fuck all for revenue and huge expenses.</p><p>‍</p><p>Founders often get attached to valuations and forget that when they sell the business, the weighing machine is the only thing that matters. The buyer has to have a way to pay themselves back, either via earnings, a future sale or strategic synergies.</p><p>‍</p><p>Your venture valuation is irrelevant. Venture valuations aren’t backed by fundamentals and their funds have been compared to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHUQ7QxS-e4">ponzi scheme</a>. Build a lifestyle business where results, traction, revenue, margins and earnings are the things that matter because at the end of the day, the numbers have to work with the weighing machine.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re bootstrapping, you can still take advantage of venture capital by using all the VC subsidized software available on the market.</p><p>‍</p><p>The internet is the greatest leveler of access to entrepreneurship society has ever seen. There is far too much focus on raising venture capital and creating 100–1000x outcomes and not nearly enough on leveraging the internet to empower entrepreneurs to build profitable and sustainable software-enabled lifestyle businesses.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>TL;DR </strong>'Rich Founder' is someone who creates a sustainable 'lifestyle business' with a high probability of success. 'Poor Founder' is someone who thinks they need to raise venture capital, a fancy office, big staff and a bunch of resources to succeed. Rich Founder has a probability of success and enjoys his/her life. Poor Founder is miserable and might as well go to a Casino and put it all down on Red 5.</p><p>‍</p><p>Here's a <a href="https://community.gradschool.co/">free community</a> and <a href="https://www.gradschool.co/">resource hub</a> to help more people become 'Rich Founders'.</p><p>‍</p><p>-James Skylor - Founder, GradSchool</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>So, is the case closed? Will we no longer need to think where our application will run anymore? Well, that's not that simple, a whole part of the world is ignored: IoT, smartphones, and all these small gadgets don't run on the same hardware as our laptops and computers.</p>
<p>You might think it's not that much of an issue: websites and other services tend to run on classic Linux servers. However, there are many situations where using a bulky server is not an option :</p>
<ul>
<li>More and more <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>objects need to connect to the Internet</strong>, and often run a Linux kernel. Using the web application we’ve already developed for a server would be ideal. It’s also true for old computers lying around, on which your new 64-bits app won’t run.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed computing at large scale</strong> is a research subject that looks promising: any piece of hardware could be part of a resilient supercomputer. That is the idea behind <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/iot/articles/how-cloud-fog-and-mist-computing-can-work-together" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fog and mist computing</a>, using every small piece of IoT available.</li>
<li>These <strong>IoT chips are more power-efficient</strong>, they can help reduce the overall energy consumption and carbon footprint of our services. Amazon Web Services does propose to use&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/a1/"> </a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/a1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special EC2 instances</a> with this kind of small machine, reducing the energy consumption and therefore the bill.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the market might change. Apple will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21284960/apple-arm-based-macs-wwdc-2020-report-intel-laptops-desktops-power-efficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announce a shift to its own </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21284960/apple-arm-based-macs-wwdc-2020-report-intel-laptops-desktops-power-efficiency">&nbsp;ARM</a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21284960/apple-arm-based-macs-wwdc-2020-report-intel-laptops-desktops-power-efficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> processor for his products</a>, abandoning classic x86 CPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, many IoT platforms don’t have the resources to run containers, but there are real use cases where you have a powerful enough machine to run Docker, but still <strong>small enough to fit in your pocket, and energy-efficient</strong>. That's the case of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi</a>, a very small computer, used in many IoT and home-server projects. That's the platform we'll use for this post.</p>
<p>Let's remind the issue: Docker has been made for your everyday computer, which is an x86-64 CPU (more about that in a few paragraphs), but not for small elements of IoT such as the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> which runs on an ARM CPU.</p>


<!--more-->
<h2 id="breaking">The breaking example</h2>
<p>Let's say you want to deploy your great <strong>Python application with docker</strong>. To keep things simple we'll create a simple Python app that just tells the date and time, using an external API (what an amazing <em>SAAS</em> concept). That's probably not very useful, but enough as an example for this post. Anyway, let's call it <strong>pytime</strong>!</p>
<p><span><em>If you don't see any code below, be sure to load the full version of the website, not the AMP !</em></span></p>

<p>That's all! We only use one dependency: <em>requests</em> which is used for the <strong>API call</strong>.</p>

<p>Now let's <strong>create a simple Dockerfile</strong> for it. We'll use the build caching system, installing dependencies first and then adding the source code.</p>

<p>Now, on your computer, you can <strong><code>build</code> and <code>push</code> the app with <code>docker</code></strong>. I assume you're already logged to your docker repository (if not, simply <code>docker login</code> for the default&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.docker.com/"> </a><a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DockerHub</a>).</p>
<p><code>$ docker build -t padok/pytime:v1.0 <br> $ docker push padok/pytime:v1.0</code></p>
<p>It would be better to deploy it on a proper infrastructure such as <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, using <a href="https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/helm-3-commands">Helm</a><a href="https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/helm-3-commands" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> charts</a> for deployments, but let's keep it simple. Let's say we <code>ssh</code> into our server and run the app directly with Docker.</p>
<p>However, here, our server is a <strong>Raspberry Pi v4</strong>, which runs on an ARM CPU (more on that later).</p>
<p><code>$ ssh pi@raspberrypi<br>$ docker run padok/pytime:v1.0<br>Unable to find image 'padok/pytime:v1.0' locally<br>v1.0: Pulling from padok/pytime<br>...<br>Status: Downloaded newer image for padok/pytime:v1.0<br>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "exec format error"</code></p>
<p>Well, that didn't go well... On your computer or a classic server you shouldn't encounter any issues, however on an ARM processor, for example on a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>, you will encounter a strange error message.</p>
<p><code>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "exec format error"</code></p>
<p>The error is not very explicit, but with some research, you'll understand that the instructions in the <strong>Docker image are just not supported by the ARM machine</strong>. That would be the case for many IoT projects. That's not what I was expecting for such a simple application. Does Docker lie when it proclaims <em>"Build Once, Run Anywhere!"</em>? Well, it is a bit more complicated, let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="architectures">About CPU architectures</h2>
<p>Before reviewing some Docker features, it is important to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instruction_set_architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPU architectures</a>, also named <strong>instruction sets</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>CPU</strong> can be classified into different categories, depending on how they are designed internally, and therefore how they communicate with the software. Your everyday computer or the server which serves this article will either run on an <strong>Intel</strong> or <strong>AMD</strong> CPU, the market leaders, which both use the same <em>language</em> with the computer: x86. However, a <strong>smartphone or a small IoT object</strong>, which needs to be <strong>power-efficient</strong>, will use <strong>smaller CPUs</strong>, which use a different <em>instruction set</em>, such as <strong>ARM</strong> or <strong>RISC-V</strong>.</p>
<p>This language is an <strong>abstraction of the physical CPU for the software</strong>. This very low-level computer language is the bridge between our high-level human code (a = a + 1) and what happens in reality: <em>fetch the value in a from memory, add 1, save the new value in the a variable's memory address</em>. For example, here is a translation for a C source code to <strong>Assembler</strong> for x86, which is very close to the actual instruction set language.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png" alt="assembler x86" width="800" srcset="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 400w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 800w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=1200&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 1200w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=1600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 1600w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=2000&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 2000w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=2400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Transforming the intelligible code into Assembler is the <strong>compilation</strong>. For Docker, the analogy will be the <strong>build</strong> step. In the preceding example, we've built an app for the <strong>x86-64</strong> architecture (the 64 bits flavor of x86, also called amd64), and we have tried to run it on an <strong>ARM</strong> CPU, it just cannot function properly!</p>
<p>But are we stuck with using Docker only on big and consuming <strong>x86</strong> CPUs, letting behind a part of the IoT ecosystem? Luckily <strong>Docker handles multiple architectures natively</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="docker">How docker handles multiples architectures</h2>
<p>On the ARM server (the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>), Docker seems to work fine.</p>
<p><code>$ docker run python:3.8.2 python --version<br>Python 3.8.2</code></p>
<p>In fact, if we had used the command docker build on this ARM machine, it would have created an image for this specific CPU architecture. The issue here is that we've created an x86-64 image and tried to use it on an ARM machine. It just cannot work.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png" alt="docker arm" width="600" srcset="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=300&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 300w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 600w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=900&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 900w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 1200w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 1500w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>By default, <strong>Docker build and pull the image for the platform it is running on</strong>. On DockerHub, you can explore which platforms are available for which version of the image. For example for&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python?tab=tags&amp;page=1&amp;name=3.8.2&amp;ordering=-name"> </a><a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python?tab=tags&amp;page=1&amp;name=3.8.2&amp;ordering=-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener">python:3.8.2</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png" alt="python 3.8.2 image" width="800" srcset="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 400w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 800w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=1200&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 1200w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=1600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 1600w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=2000&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 2000w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=2400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Using the <em>digest</em> column, you can <strong>specify the image you want to pull</strong>. For example, if you want to pull an <em>arm/v7</em> (which is 32 bit) image specifically, you can just type get the specific version with:</p>
<p><code>$ docker pull python@sha256:14984d57dabd5ddb4789a65e5d64965473121c4ded5f8143161fbeb28713eebf</code></p>
<p>Even better, since the previous solution pins the image version in time, disabling security fixes, you can <strong>specify the architecture with a prefix</strong>. For example:</p>
<p><code>$ docker pull arm32v7/python:3.8.2</code></p>
<p>These solutions, either the automatic platform detection or the manual selection allows us to <strong>avoid relying on a complex tagging system</strong> such as <code>myapp:1.3.2-arm</code>.</p>
<p>Here we have a solution. Let's just <strong>build the app directly on the ARM server</strong>. Indeed, it will run correctly on the specific CPU. But we have new issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we've totally <strong>broken our CI/CD process</strong>. No more image registry, you have to launch a new build on all your target devices every time a new version is released. You could install a CI/CD runner directly on the machine but it is limited by the following point.</li>
<li>Secondly, <strong>ARM processors are often slow </strong>and<strong> quite limited in power</strong>. The compilation could strain resources from the main process and takes quite a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to be able to build our app <em>once</em>, on our machine or a CI/CD solution and forget about the hardware it will run on! Luckily, Docker has also a solution for us.</p>
<h2 id="buildx">Multi-architecture builds with Buildx</h2>
<p><strong>Buildx</strong> is an experimental <strong>feature of Docker</strong>, so check that you've got at least <em>Docker 19.03</em> with <span>docker version</span>. Then, you can enable <em>buildx</em> (and other experimental features) for the current shell:</p>
<p><code>$ export DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled</code></p>
<p>Now you should be able to run</p>
<p><code>$ docker buildx ls<br>NAME/NODE DRIVER/ENDPOINT STATUS PLATFORMS<br>default * docker<br>default default running linux/amd64, linux/386</code></p>
<p>Here we can see that our current docker <em>builder</em> is able to <strong>construct images two different architectures</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>amd64</strong> which refers to the <strong>x86-64</strong> instruction set, which is the 64-bit version of the mainstream <strong>x86</strong> instruction set. That's the architecture your computer is probably running on. Since <em>AMD</em> first released the 64-bit version, they got the name.</li>
<li><strong>386</strong>, often referred to as i386 (i as in <em>Intel</em>) is the legacy 32-bit version of the <strong>x86</strong> instruction set.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <em>buildx</em> you could compile a 32-bit version of your docker image for an old computer! And it can also works for our exotic ARM CPU.</p>
<p>However, we will need yet another tool for this: <em><strong>qemu</strong></em>, a <em>cross-compilation</em> framework. <strong>Cross-compilation</strong> is compiling software for an architecture B on a computer running on architecture A. For example, compiling for <strong>ARM</strong> on an <strong>amd64</strong> platform. That's exactly what we want! Using complicated Linux functionalities which I won't explain here (if you're interested, read <a href="https://linki.tools/2020/01/cross-arch-reproducibility-using-containers.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this article</a>), we can give <em>buildx</em> some <em><strong>qemu</strong></em> steroids!</p>
<p><code>$ docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes</code></p>
<p><em>It will only work for the current session. If you reboot you'll have to run this command again.</em></p>
<p>Now let's create a new <em>builder</em> with <em>buildx</em>, which will be able to use <em>qemu</em> abilities.</p>
<p><code>$ docker buildx create --name mybuilder --driver docker-container --use</code></p>
<p>Now let's display the available platforms I can build on. We need to <strong><em>bootstrap </em></strong>the builder, i.e. initialize it.</p>
<p><code>$ docker buildx inspect --bootstrap<br>Name: mybuilder<br>Driver: docker-container<p>Nodes:<br>Name: mybuilder0<br>Endpoint: unix:///var/run/docker.sock<br>Status: running<br>Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/riscv64, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x, linux/386, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6</p></code></p>
<p>We have many more platforms available. If you check on <strong>DockerHub</strong>, you'll see that there is <strong>no base image</strong> for <strong>riscv64</strong>, we'll have to remove it from the list. To …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

<h3>Safety and efficacy</h3>
<p>After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Russian researchers extracted a fragment of genetic material from novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2, which codes information about the structure of the spike S-protein, which forms the virus’ “crown” and is responsible for connection with human cells. They inserted it into a familiar adenovirus vector for delivery into a human cell creating the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>In order to ensure lasting immunity Russian scientists came up with a breakthrough idea to use two different types of adenovirus vectors (rAd26 and rAd5) for the first and second vaccination, boosting the effect of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The use of human adenoviruses as vectors is safe because these viruses, which cause the common cold, are not novel and have been around for thousands of years.</p> </div>

				<p><em> Caroline Rodewig and Garrett McGrath are members of FlightAware's Flight Tracking Wing. As lead for the Predictive Technology Crew, Caroline works to expand the scope and quality of our predictive applications. Garrett is the lead for the Aviation Platform Crew and responsible for the performance, reliability and observability of multi-machine Hyperfeed. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="monitoringhyperfeedthehistoryandchallengesofadistributedsystem">Monitoring Hyperfeed: The History and Challenges of a Distributed System</h2>
<p>The Aviation Platform crew (for an explanation of crews and wings,<a href="https://flightaware.engineering/crews-wings-and-alliances-part-1-the-principles-of-how-we-work/" target="_see this blog post"> see this blog post</a>) revolves around the performance and reliability of Hyperfeed<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Hyperfeed is FlightAware’s core flight tracking engine. Its output powers the company’s most salient offerings: the <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ABW140" target="_blank"> flight pages</a> on the website, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/firehose/" target="_blank">Firehose</a>, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/flightxml/">FlightXML</a>, and <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/premium/">flight alerts</a>. So if Hyperfeed stops working, so does much of FlightAware. Given the impact of a Hyperfeed outage, we need to know immediately if something goes—or might go—wrong so that we can act swiftly and precisely to remedy the situation. For maintaining the requisite accuracy and timeliness of Hyperfeed’s output, we rely heavily on monitoring<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. To that end, we have recently begun adopting Prometheus, a time-series metrics database, and Grafana, a powerful visualization platform. The introduction of these tools marks a significant upgrade and improvement to Hyperfeed’s current monitoring stack. It is hoped that by sharing our experience and the reasons for adoption that we can help inform the decision-making of others in an analogous situation.</p>
<p>Before discussing Prometheus and the many enhancements it brings to our monitoring of Hyperfeed, it helps to provide some context by examining what we currently use and how it has evolved over time. In its current form, Hyperfeed is a distributed system composed of a constellation of more than a dozen components and sub-systems spread across multiple machines for performance and fault-tolerance. Its sub-systems include a number of other well-known services: Postgres, Zookeeper, Kafka, and RabbitMQ. It wasn’t always like this, though. When I started working on Hyperfeed in 2016, it was not distributed; its components all ran on a single machine (this is not strictly true as it also used a Postgres database running on a separate server). Naturally, monitoring at that time was relatively less complex: it had markedly less surface area to cover. We were able to do the job effectively with a combination of custom, in-house tools and a heavy dose of Zabbix.</p>
<p>Our custom monitoring tools mostly consisted of some scripts that followed Hyperfeed’s output and its logging statements looking for problems, e.g., the output has stopped completely, the output is out of date, or an excess number of tracebacks happened. These tools were specific to Hyperfeed and did not generalize well to other software. Zabbix, on the other hand, has been FlightAware’s primary monitoring and alerting framework. It is used throughout the company and not specific to any piece of software. When applied to Hyperfeed, Zabbix monitored some key characteristics of the server running the application such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Moreover, the aforementioned custom tools fed their data into Zabbix so that they could be used for alerting an engineer if something went haywire. On top of that, Zabbix gave us a basic web interface for viewing the data it collected in a graphical format. Back when Hyperfeed fit snugly on a single server, this sort of monitoring served us well: Zabbix was a one-stop shop for all things monitoring. But as the demands placed on Hyperfeed grew, so did its operational complexity.</p>
<p>Eventually, a single-machine architecture was not enough to handle the increased volume of Hyperfeed’s input, which was precipitated by FlightAware acquiring <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/aireon/" target="_blank">new data sources</a>, and expanding its <a href="https://flightaware.com/adsb/" target="_blank">existing data sources</a>. In order to accommodate this change in scale, it was necessary to distribute Hyperfeed across multiple machines. When this happened, we continued using (and still do use) custom tools and Zabbix for monitoring. Our custom tools, though, and the data we send to Zabbix necessarily expanded, too. Although distributing Hyperfeed across multiple machines was necessary and improved the performance and reliability of the system, it also brought with it new challenges and difficulties, particularly in terms of monitoring<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Given their origin, our custom tools were not designed with a distributed setting in mind. As such, they lacked the ability to easily aggregate data across multiple machines and were somewhat cumbersome to operate as Hyperfeed’s architecture progressed. In addition, Zabbix started creaking and revealing some rough edges as we placed more demands on it. A core issue was that Zabbix does really well at monitoring particular machines but not as well at system or application level monitoring, especially in a context where services can move around from machine to machine as failures occur or as an intentional part of the design. In a distributed setting, it also imposes non-trivial operational burdens, e.g., when adding new monitoring points or spreading the collection load across machines. Moreover, Zabbix combines all monitoring functions into a single monolith rather than the current best practice of loosely coupling monitoring tasks like collecting data, long-term storage, querying data, alerting with deduplication and aggregation, and visualization/dashboarding (for further details on monitoring system best practices, see the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/monitoring/" target="_blank">Google SRE workbook’s monitoring chapter</a>).</p>
<p>As Hyperfeed moved to a distributed architecture, a change driven by business demands and an increased volume of flight tracking data, it became clear that our monitoring tools, while mostly satisfactory in alerting us when something failed in the system, neglected to provide us with many of the other benefits that monitoring can offer. In particular, we were weak in whitebox monitoring and visualization<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>.Whitebox monitoring is especially important for analyzing long-term trends, comparing experimental groups, and in guiding capacity planning and other engineering decision making. Some information can only come from the vantage point provided by whitebox monitoring. For visualization we had Zabbix, but its capabilities there are fairly limited and inflexible. Given all of this, we started looking for a new solution to fill in the gaps in our monitoring approach, something designed for dynamic, distributed systems. We chose Prometheus and Grafana. This combo of tools addresses the shortcomings of our current approach, and also brings with it a number of additional virtues.</p>
<h2 id="upgradingmonitoringwithprometheusandgrafana">Upgrading Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana</h2>
<h3 id="prometheustimeseriesmetrics">Prometheus: Time-Series Metrics</h3>
<p>In an idealized monitoring practice, every event or state of a system is recorded so that it is available if needed: no detail is left out. Unfortunately, this only works in a hypothetical, theoretical scenario since it is impossible to store, process, and work with the quantity of data generated continuously by modern systems. Instead of capturing everything, one must grapple with what to monitor: how to turn the endless torrent of events in a system into something comprehensible, manageable, and actionable. To this end, Prometheus provides time-series metrics, which track aggregations of events in a system over some period of time, where an event refers to anything that might occur and can be quantified or measured. Some example events include a function getting called, CPU usage going up, a web request being made, a client connecting to a service or a cache hit happens.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Fundamentally, the monitoring offered by Prometheus periodically takes a snapshot of some of the events in a system, typically measuring how often or how quickly each event occurred. The value of a snapshot at any given point is often of less interest than its relative value: how the frequency of an event changes over time provides the actionable insight and value of metrics-based monitoring. To make this more concrete, in the case of flight tracking some example time-series metrics of interest might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Departures per second</li>
<li>Arrivals per day</li>
<li>Cancellations per minute</li>
<li>Diversions per hour</li>
<li>Flight plans created per second</li>
<li>Input messages processed per second</li>
<li>Output messages generated per second</li>
<li>99th percentile of the time taken to process an ADS-B position over the last 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in order to keep the amount of data captured manageable, the contents of the input messages that trigger each of these events get aggregated away. With metrics, the rate of departures, for example, are measured throughout the system, but any single departure cannot be investigated. As succinctly summarized by <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-101-collecting-data/" target="_blank">Datadog</a>, metrics provide “the big, broad-stroke measures that can help you quickly answer the most pressing questions about a system’s internal health and performance.“ Metrics can also capture resource utilization, like CPU, memory, or disk, and metadata like code revisions and configuration values. Time-series metrics, despite necessarily omitting a lot of detail, are still quite versatile, yielding practicable monitoring data for critical activities throughout a system.</p>
<h3 id="dataandoperationalmodel">Data and Operational Model</h3>
<p>One of Prometheus’ main selling points is that it provides a powerful and conceptually straightforward data model for extracting metrics from a system of interest and tracking their rate of change over time. Each time-series metric tracked by Prometheus includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric name: a string indicating what the metric is for, e.g., <code>hyperfeed_departures_total</code>.</li>
<li>Help documentation: a string describing what the metric is for or where it comes from.</li>
<li>Metric type: four types are provided, but two of them provide the atomic building blocks of the others. The fundamental types are counters, which can only go up or reset, and gauges, which can be set to any value.</li>
<li>Labels: key-value pairs attaching additional dimensions to the metric. Labels …</li></ul></section></div></article></div></div>

<p>Sixty years ago this week — on August 12, 1960 — Dr. Seuss published what would become his biggest-selling book of all time. Written as the result of a $50 bet between Seuss and his friend and publisher at Random House, Bennett Cerf, the book, by some estimates, has sold north of 200 million copies.*</p>



<p>The book? <em>Green Eggs and Ham.</em></p>



<p>When I discuss <em>Becoming Dr. Seuss </em>with audiences, Seuss fans tell me they have warm memories of this one; it’s the book that taught them how to read, or it’s the first book they received as a gift — or, as grown-ups, it’s a book they can still quote and recite word-for-word. And it <em>is </em>a great book–but it’s an important one, too, both in the Seuss library and in the overall oeuvre of children’s literature. There’s a lot going on between its colorful orange boards, the result of sweat, inspiration, and no small amount of luck. But to truly appreciate how smart, and how important <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> is, we need to go back a few years before its 1960 publication to get some background and some context. </p>

<p>Let’s start, then, by checking in with this May 1954 issue of LIFE magazine (that’s comedic actress Kaye Ballard on the cover, by the way, who was burning up Broadway in the musical <em>The Golden Apple</em> and would later make an appearance on <em>The Muppet Show</em>) which features an article by Pulitzer Prize winning novelist John Hersey titled, “Why Do Students Bog Down on the First ‘R’?” The cover text teases the article as  “Why Can’t My Child Read?” but the gist is the same: namely, Hersey was discouraged by the low rates of childhood literacy in the United States, and placed the blame for children’s lack of interest in reading squarely on the shoulders of the ponderous <em>Dick and Jane </em>standard reading primers on which several generations of children had been raised. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6313" data-permalink="https://brianjayjones.com/efarm2txsaeescx/" data-orig-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg" data-orig-size="594,473" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="efarm2txsaeescx" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=500" src="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=594" alt="" width="282" height="224" srcset="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=282 282w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=564 564w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px"><figcaption>John Hersey</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The real problem, as Hersey saw it, was that Dick and Jane were<em> terrible</em>. The text — with its now-easily lampooned, “Look, Jane, look. See the ball?” syntax — was bad enough, but Hersey thought the artwork was even worse–“insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children,” he railed. No one, he concluded, was interested in reading about Dick and Jane and their lives of quiet desperation. At the very least, suggested Hersey, couldn’t they get Dr. Seuss to illustrate the otherwise turgid text?</p>



<p>They never would get Dr. Seuss to illustrate Dick and Jane; instead, Seuss was approached by William Spaulding, an editor of children’s books at Random House rival Houghton Mifflin, who had read Hersey’s article and begged Dr. Seuss to “write me a story that first graders can’t put down.”</p>



<p>But there was a catch. Putting aside all their other problems, Dick and Jane were at least living their dull lives inside an actual reading primer, operating under a strict educator-approved vocabulary list of about 300 unique words at the first grade reading level. For his book, then, Dr. Seuss would have to play by those same rules, using only the words on the sanctioned reading list. Seuss told Spaulding he’d take the list home and “play with it.”</p>



<p>He played with it for nearly a year. It was, he said later, an “impossible and ridiculous task…I was forbidden to use any words beyond the list. I almost threw the job up.” Eventually, he decided to read through the list one last time, vowing that “if I find two words that rhyme and make sense to me, that’s the title.” Unfortunately,<em> tall </em>and <em>ball</em> were a bust.</p>

<p><em>Cat </em>and <em>hat</em>, however, were not.</p>



<p>After another year of work, Dr. Seuss published <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> in the Spring of 1957.** For <em>Cat</em>, Seuss had used 236 unique words from the word list. (His total word count, with repeated words, is about 1,600.) It was Seuss’ first real blockbuster of a book — the one that permitted him to finally devote himself full-time to writing and drawing books for children. But more importantly, <em>Cat in the Hat </em>is a bestseller with a pedagogy; with its reliance on the officially-sanctioned word list, it’s a book teachers approved of, one parents loved, and one kids actually wanted to read. In 1957, that was a game changer.</p>

<p>Inspired by the huge success of the Cat, Random House created a new imprint called Beginner Books, aimed squarely at beginning readers and which continued to lean on the educator-approved word list. Dr. Seuss was brought in as the imprint’s president and editor–a seat from which he would not only recruit and work with other writers and artists on children’s books (one of the most popular of which was P.D. Eastman’s <em>Go, Dog. Go!</em>) but would also regularly produce his own books under the new logo, featuring the Cat himself.</p>



<p>Among the first books Dr. Seuss produced for the Beginner Books imprint was <em>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish</em>, completed in 1959. <em>One Fish</em> was an experiment for Seuss, as he was deliberately using an even more restrictive word list of short words, and placing the accompanying drawings as close to the text as he possibly could, like so:</p>

<p>It would be the prototype for a new line of books Seuss was already informally calling “Beginner Beginner Books,” aimed at very early readers with limited vocabularies. Soon, there would be a new imprint at Random House, overseen by Seuss, and formally designated with the moniker Bright &amp; Early Books. The Bright &amp; Early Books relied on an approved vocabulary list of only 182 simple words—a little more than half as large as the already restrictive list adhered to by Beginner Books.</p>

<p>Still with me? In 1959, Random House publisher Bennett Cerf approached Dr. Seuss and gleefully pointed out that the new Bright &amp; Early imprint relied on a tight list of 182 words. Then he laid down a playful and very specific challenge: <em>could Dr. Seuss write a book using only 50 of those words?</em> </p>



<p>Cerf bet Dr. Seuss $50 that he couldn’t. </p>



<p>Challenge accepted.</p>



<p>Seuss, who who had agonized and struggled with a broader and less restrictive word list as he worked on <em>The Cat in the Hat, </em>nevertheless rose to the occasion. But it’s probably no coincidence that the resulting book was all about convincing someone to do something they didn’t really want to do.</p>

<p><em>Green Eggs and Ham </em>would be its own kind of misery, requiring Seuss to create complicated charts, checklists, and multiple word counts as he struggled to keep track of the words he was using. He also imposed on himself a requirement to stick with one-syllable words, though he would make an exception for “anywhere,” which was made up of two short words that young readers would know.</p>



<p>Rhyming, too, could be tough with a fifty word restriction. “The agony is terrific at times, and the attribution is horrible,” he said. “If you’re doing it in quatrains and get to the end of four lines and can’t make it work, then it’s like unraveling a sock. You take some of your best stuff and throw it away.”</p>



<p>Dr. Seuss delivered <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> to Cerf at Random House in 1960. He was glad to be done with it, and somewhat nervous about how it would be received.</p>



<p>We all know how it turned out. “The good doctor has scored another triumph,” exclaimed the <em>New York Times</em>, while one reviewer wrote presciently of <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>: “A vocabulary of only fifty words, but they will long be remembered.”</p>

<p>For the rest of his life, Dr. Seuss would find himself at book signings and dinners in his honor where he would be served plates filled with green eggs and ham. “Deplorable stuff,” he said later, “The worst was on a yacht in six-foot seas.”</p>



<p>Generations of readers would look for hidden meanings and metaphors in its text—but for Dr. Seuss, <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> was only ever about one thing: “Cerf bet me fifty bucks I couldn’t write a book using only 50 words,” he said later. “I did it to show I could.”</p>



<p>Oh, and Seuss also said later that Bennett Cerf never paid him his fifty dollars. </p>



<p>Regardless, Happy 60th Birthday to <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>. Thank you, thank you, Sam I Am (and Dr. Seuss!)</p>

<p>* Publishers can be persnickety about releasing sales figures on the record. Total sales for <em>Green Eggs </em>are reported as anywhere from 8 million to 15 million to 200 million.</p>



<p>* * In a trade-off deal, Random House–Dr. Seuss’s normal publisher–permitted Houghton Mifflin to publish the textbook version of <em>Cat in the Hat </em>for schools, while Random House retained the trade rights. As it turned out, few schools bought the textbook version. Random House would make a mint off the Cat; Houghton — where the idea had originated in the first place! — not so much. Random House would eventually acquire the textbook rights back from its rival, and promptly shelve them, preferring to issue only the trade edition.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://reeve.blog/blog/principles/">recently argued</a> that 80% of a product manager’s job is to discover the right product to build and drive organizational alignment. At the same time, ‘product discovery’ is often the most nebulous part of the job. So how&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;great product managers do this? While product discovery will never be easy, I’ll outline a simple yet effective framework that I use.</p>



<p>There are many great books about product discovery. They also tend to be complicated and tricky to reference day-to-day. So over time, I’ve tried to simplify this, and I’ve distilled it down into what I call the “Five P’s.” In my experience, all five have to be defined and considered when deciding what to build:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the mission of your company or product?</li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>What is the customer or user problem we’re solving?</li><li><strong>Pattern:</strong> How many people are impacted by this problem?</li><li><strong>Prose: </strong>What is the narrative for how solving this problem benefits the customer and our business?</li><li><strong>Priority: </strong>How important is this solving this problem vs. other problems on which we could focus?</li></ul>







<p>Your purpose is why your company or product exists, reflected as a mission and strategy. Without this, you’re flying blind. There’s no use in identifying the auto industry’s most common problems if your mission is to create the world’s leading crypto bank:</p>



<ol><li>A <strong>mission</strong> statement is what you’re trying to accomplish. E.g., <em>Plant a billion trees on each continent to offset the world’s carbon emissions. </em>A mission statement should be concise, opinionated, inspiring, and action-oriented (i.e., begin with a verb.)</li><li>A <strong>strategy</strong> is how you’re going to achieve your mission. E.g., <em>Identify suitable land, build irrigation systems, procure seeds and fertilizer, sow seeds by helicopter.</em></li><li><strong>Vision</strong> and mission are easily confused. Think of vision as defining what the world will look like when you’ve achieved your mission.<em> </em>E.g., <em>we’ve offset the world’s carbon emissions by 30%, providing cleaner air to billions of people.</em></li></ol>



<p>Investing time in defining a purpose may seem abstract. Still, it’s critical: Having a clear and compelling mission and strategy inspires a product team and points discovery efforts in the right direction. For product “tracks” within larger companies, the track’s purpose should contribute to the company’s purpose. Boz (VP at Facebook) wrote a great article on mission and strategy <a href="https://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics">here</a>.</p>







<p>The core part of effective product management is identifying pain within the context of your mission and strategy. What problems do your target customers have? Why do people like or not like your product? Are your customers asking for something?</p>



<p>Problems can surface qualitatively or quantitatively:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> This might include user experience research, a customer call series, feature requests from users, input from your team or stakeholders, competitor research, or your own product judgment. To paraphrase <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablue/">Allen Blue</a>, look for places where your target customers are already “duct-taping” things together.</li><li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> What you’ve identified through studying trends in your metrics. Product managers should study their metrics daily to understand how the product is performing and identify problems and opportunities.</li></ul>



<p>Customers will often tell you the solution, not the problem. They’re trying to be helpful. But well-intentioned customers usually don’t know what’s possible, nor what will work best for your product. Asking the right questions can help identify the problem:</p>



<ul><li>If you get X, what will it help you do?</li><li>What happens if you don’t get X?</li><li>If you don’t get X, how will you achieve Y?</li></ul>



<p>Be careful in situations where there’s a “layer” between you and the user. Suppose the person you’re talking with is an intermediary (e.g., the buyer or someone who administers the product within a company): In this scenario, they may not understand the experience from the end user’s perspective. Be mindful of who is answering your questions.</p>



<p>Finally, while many formal research functions support the discovery process (product marketing, user research, etc.), a deep understanding of the customer can’t be delegated to another function. Great product managers have strong opinions and intuition; this comes from being exposed to raw feedback, e.g., attending customer calls, studying metrics, and talking to users.</p>







<p>Most of the time, product managers are looking for systemic issues that impact a large percentage of your target customers. We can define ‘systemic’ in different ways: The number of customers with a problem, the value of the customers who have the problem (e.g., how much they spend with you), or whether they are uniquely significant (e.g., a prominent “brand name”).</p>



<p>There are going to be situations where solving an isolated problem is the right call. You might choose to build something purely because a critical customer is asking for it. You might prioritize something for a small but essential cohort of users (e.g., power users or promoters). These are fine, but they should be the exception, not the norm.</p>







<p>The word ‘prose’ underscores the importance of looking beyond a singular metric. Don’t get me wrong, moving metrics is crucial, and I spend a lot of time doing just that, but they aren’t exhaustive. Too often, I see product teams focusing on tuning a singular metric without considering the entire ecosystem or whether something is the right long-term investment as part of a broader mission and strategy. </p>



<p>Even worse, product teams may shy away from building a great product because they can’t predict the quantitative impact of building it. <strong>In practice, you often won’t be able to accurately predict the metric impact of shipping a brand new product or making a step-function change.</strong> </p>



<p>Persuasive prose forces product teams to consider both the quantitative and qualitative effects of building something <em>and</em> how it ties to a broader mission and strategy. It underscores the value of having a clear and compelling narrative for understanding:</p>



<ol><li>What the problem is.</li><li>Why the problem should be solved.</li><li>How the problem will be solved.</li><li>The qualitative and quantitative impact of solving the problem.</li><li>How solving the problem contributes to a broader mission and strategy.</li></ol>



<p><strong>I’ll touch on the two main tools I use when working with ‘prose’:</strong></p>



<p><strong>The first you’re probably familiar with, which is the hypothetical external press release, </strong><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html"><strong>popularized by Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The press release explains what the product is, why it exists, and the features and benefits. It’s a compelling articulation of the value that the product delivers to the customer and the market. If it isn’t compelling, you may either not be solving the right problem, or not have the right product to solve it.</p>



<p><strong>But I’m guessing you haven’t heard of the second application of ‘prose’:</strong> The concept is similar, but it’s an <em>internal</em><strong><em> </em></strong>press release. Imagine you’re summarizing the “why,” “what,” and “how” to your CEO. Articulate the problem you’re solving, how it ties to broader mission and strategy, how you’re going to solve it, and the impact that solving it will have on your business. This internal press release will narrate what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and support it with qualitative and quantitative data. And yes, for any significant decision, you should share it! This exercise identifies incongruencies in your logic, and it will also help communicate the value of doing something.</p>







<p>Prioritization is conceptually simple. In practice, it’s harder and often imprecise, a mixture of art and science. Usually, it’s about the cost versus benefit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>First, we want to understand the impact of solving a problem:</strong> How much will it move a given metric? How many customers have asked for this? Will this increase retention? Will it unlock a portion of the market?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Second, we need to have a sense of how much solving it will cost:</strong> How many engineering weeks are required to build the solution? What are the support and marketing costs?</li></ul>



<p>There are many prioritization frameworks, including <a href="https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15">ICE</a>, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/">RICE, and many others</a>. Still, I’ve found that they often miss the need for product teams to balance multiple distinct success metrics and “themes” of work. I’ve had success with a slightly augmented version of ICE that I’ve eloquently named <strong>MICE</strong> (Metric, Impact, Confidence, Ease.)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metric: </strong>What is the importance of the metric that this feature will move? E.g., do we care more about improving activation, or more about retention?</li><li><strong>Impact: </strong>What is the impact of solving this problem based on the pattern you’ve identified?</li><li><strong>Confidence: </strong>What is our confidence in this impact?</li><li><strong>Ease: </strong>How easy is this problem to solve? (An inverse of cost, higher is cheaper.)</li><li>Multiply M*I*C*E, and sort from highest to lowest.</li></ul>



<p>A prioritization framework will give you a way of loosely sorting what you <em>could</em> work on, but it’s a supplement for judgment, not a replacement. “Because the framework said so” isn’t a valid reason for prioritizing something. Prioritization is always a balancing act between data, intuition, and stakeholder alignment.</p>



<p>Always remember that teams are comprised of people, and people are better when they aren’t stretched thin across multiple contexts. Set a theme for the quarter (e.g., we’re going to nail this particular customer type or user persona), and focus on making material progress within that theme, instead of trying to solve a dozen problems for a dozen different customer segments. Great focus yields great results.</p>







<p>Someday, I’ll write a longer piece about driving organizational alignment (which is just a fancy way of saying “getting people to agree that this is the right thing to build”). Still, it’s so important that this article wouldn’t be complete without touching on it.</p>



<p>Organizational alignment has to start early, and often. The mechanics are incredibly variable, but there are a few unavoidable pieces:</p>



<ul><li><strong>1-1 conversations: </strong>Asking a group of 10 people, “what do you think about this?” isn’t how you create alignment and understanding. In my …</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<p>For my open source RTL projects, I’ve so far only used 2 Verilog simulators: 
<a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">Icarus Verilog</a> and <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.</p>

<p>Icarus Verilog is a traditional event-driven simulator with support for most of the behavioral Verilog constructs that
can be found in complex Verilog testbenches: delays, <code>repeat</code> statements, etc. If you can look past its simulation
speed (it’s <em>very</em> slow), it does the job pretty well, and allows one to stay within a pure Verilog environment just
like you would with commercial tools such as VCS, Modelsim etc.</p>

<p>Verilator is a completely different beast: it’s a cycle based simulator that, with some exceptions, only takes
in synthesizable RTL, removes all notions of time or delays, and simulates from one cycle to the next. Cycle
based simulators are much faster than event driven ones, and Verilator is one of the best in class that
routinely beats commercial simulators. Verilator compiles your Verilog design into a bunch of C++ files and
then into a linkable library. All you need to do is write a C++ wrapper (which can be very small) that
calls the library for each simulation step, and you’re on your way. ZipCPU has <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">a very good Verilator
tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Verilator can be 500x faster than Icarus Verilog. When the simulation time of my projects gets too
long, I usually switch from Icarus to Verilator.</p>

<p>Icarus and Verilator aren’t the only open source Verilog simulators, but they are the most popular by far. And
for good reason: Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HDL_simulators#Free_and_open-source_simulators">lists</a> a number
of alternatives, but one constant between them is the lack of support for modern Verilog features. I’ve
never seen anybody use them…</p>



<p>Yosys is the star of the open source synthesis world. It initially rose to prominence with the release of 
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/">Claire Wolff</a>’s <a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/">Project IceStorm</a>, 
where it’s the synthesis component of an end-to-end open source RTL to bitstream flow for Lattice ICE40 FPGAs.</p>

<p>But Yosys is much more than that.</p>

<p>It’s a Swiss army knife of digital logic manipulation that takes in a digital design through one of its so-called frontends 
(Verilog, blif, json, ilang, even VHDL and SystemVerilog for the commercial version), provides tons of different passes that transform 
the digital logic one way or the other (e.g. flatten a hierarchy, remove redundant logic, map generic gates to 
specific technology gates, check formal equivalence), and a bunch of backends that write the final design in 
some desired format (Verilog, Spice, json, SMT2, etc.)</p>

<p>If you have a blob of synthesizable digital logic and you need to perform some kind of transformation, chances are that Yosys
already supports it.</p>

<p>Yosys’ commands are relatively well documented, but, unfortunately, the documentation snapshots on 
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/documentation.html">the official Yosys website</a> are often woefully behind.</p>

<p>To get the latest and greatest list of commands, it’s best to just compile Yosys and use the <code>help</code> function
from the command line of the tool.</p>

<p><em>The amount of information can be overwhelming (there are a large amount of commands that I don’t quite understand
myself), but, luckily, it’s not necessary to understand most of the commands: in many cases, it’s sufficient to use
ready-made recipes to go from RTL to a synthesized gate-level netlist.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/tree/master/backends/cxxrtl">CXXRTL</a> is a new Yosys backend. It writes out 
the digital logic inside Yosys as a set of C++ classes, one for each remaining module, after performing whichever 
transformation pass you want to apply.</p>

<p>In combination with <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl.h"><code>cxxrtl.h</code></a>,
a single C++ include file with template classes that implement variable width bitvector arithmetic, the C++ classes become a 
simulation model of the digital design.</p>

<p>Just like with Verilator, the simulation model is cycle-based. And just like Verilator, you need to provide a thin
C++ wrapper that calls these classes to perform a step-by-step simulation.</p>



<p>Going from Verilog to running a simulation is straightforward.</p>

<p>CXXRTL is very new and moving fast. This blog post had to be updated multiple times due to new features being added.</p>

<p>For an up-to-date state of features, it’s best to bring up the CXXRTL manual from within Yosys:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; yosys
...
yosys&gt; help write_cxxrtl

    write_cxxrtl [options] [filename]

Write C++ code that simulates the design. The generated code requires a driver
that instantiates the design, toggles its clock, and interacts with its ports.

The following driver may be used as an example for a design with a single clock
driving rising edge triggered flip-flops:

    #include "top.cc"
...
</code></pre></div></div>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible Black-boxing of Submodules</p>

    <p>This makes it possible to replace any module inside the design hierarchy
  with a behavior model that’s written in C++.</p>

    <p>This can be useful for a variety of reasons during the development process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VCD Waveform Generation</p>

    <p>A simulator isn’t worth much when it doesn’t support dumping debug waveforms.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl_vcd.h">VCD waveform writer</a> 
  is only around 200 lines of C++ code and serves as a great example for those who want to write similar 
  tools, such as support for different waveform dump file formats.</p>

    <p>An example is provided below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design introspection</p>

    <p>Design introspection allows the testbench itself to go through the whole design 
  <em>at run time</em> and discover and interact with all objects that contain a value or state.</p>

    <p>The VCD waveform generation uses this feature to come up with all the storage elements
  (signals, memories) that need to be dumped, but introspection opens up all kinds of other 
  possibilities that are discussed further below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implementation Simplicity</p>

    <p>One of the most attractive points of CXXRTL is the simplicity of the implementation.</p>

    <p>The Yosys backend CXXRTL is small. The generated code is understandable (to a point). The execution 
  model is straightforward. It uses a single bit vector data representation and C++ templates to 
  implement Yosys digital logic primitives.</p>

    <p>It may not have the performance of Verilator (which has seen more than 20 years of
  performance optimizations), but if you had to implement some new feature, like 
  adding support for a new waveform format, it’d be trivial compared to adding that
  to Verilator.</p>

    <p>When writing this blog post, I often needed to dive into the code to clarify some details,
  and other than the complexity that’s inherent to C++ templates, I found the whole
  experience relatively painless.</p>

    <p>I consider this a major plus for an open source project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C API</p>

    <p>For those who can’t use C++ for the testbench wrapper, there is a C API that allows pure
  C to do almost anything you can do with the default C++ interface.</p>

    <p>The simulation model itself still needs to be compiled with C++, but this is useful
  to integrate and link the simulation model into language such a Python (which
  uses C to call foreign libraries).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Automatically benefits from Yosys front-end improvements</p>

    <p>Whenever a new front-end feature gets added to Yosys, CXXRTL benefits from that
  as well.</p>

    <p>SystemVerilog is a good example of this: while the pure open source version of Yosys only
  covers to small subset of SystemVerilog language features, 
  <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/commit/7e83a51fc96495c558a31fc3ca6c1a5ba4764f15">new</a>

    <p>Similarly, the <a href="https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin">ghdl-yosys-plugin</a> project has
  been working towards adding Yosys VHDL support.</p>

    <p>Since all these front-ends compile to the same intermediate data representation that
  is used by CXXRTL, this improved simulation feature support to automatic!</p>

    <p>Once the Yosys gHDL integration stabilize, CXXRTL will be the only open source simulator
  with mixed Verilog/VHDL language support!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simulation Speed</p>

    <p>CXXRTL is orders of magnitude faster than Icarus Verilog.</p>

    <p>But see below…</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simulation Speed</p>

    <p>My current benchmark is a small VexRiscv CPU running a C program that toggles 3 LEDs.</p>

    <p>In the fastest settings, CXXRTL is about 8x slower than single-threaded Verilator.</p>

    <p>You can find my benchmarking results <a href="https://github.com/tomverbeure/cxxrtl_eval/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</p>

    <p>One should not rely on just one benchmark, and others have reported simulation speed
  differences that aren’t as large. Verilog coding style differences, or the type of
  logic could play a major role here.</p></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

			<p>Many people who use Rust for a bit - especially those who like the language but
do not fall in love with it - feel a sense that there must be a smaller,
simpler variation on the same theme which would maybe be a little less
powerful, but would also be much easier to use. I agree with them, but I think
they are almost always wrong about what would need to change. Here are some
notes on where I would start to create that smaller Rust.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-rust-work">What makes Rust work</h2>
<p>People almost always start in precisely the wrong place when they say how they
would change Rust, because they almost always start by saying they would add
garbage collection. This can only come from a place of naive confusion about
what makes Rust work.</p>
<p>Rust works because it enables users to write in an imperative programming
style, which is the mainstream style of programming that most users are
familiar with, while avoiding to an impressive degree the kinds of bugs that
imperative programming is notorious for. As I said once, pure functional
programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but
Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
<p>Here are the necessary components of Rust to make imperative programming work
as a paradigm. Shockling few other production-ready imperative languages have
the first of these, and none of them have the others at all (at least, none
have them implemented correctly; C++ has unsafe analogs). Unsurprisingly, the
common names for these concepts are all opaque nonsense:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Algebraic data types”:</strong> Having both “product types” (in Rust <em>structs</em>)
and “sum types” (in Rust <em>enums</em>) is crucial. The language must not have
null, it must instead use an Option wrapper. It must have strong pattern
matching and destructuring facilities, and never insert implicit crashing
branches.</li>
<li><strong>Resource acquisition is initialization:</strong> Objects should manage
conceptual resources like file descriptors and sockets, and have destructors
which clean up resource state when the object goes out of scope. It should be
trivial to be confident the destructor will run when the object goes out of
scope. This necesitates most of ownership, moving, and borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Aliasable XOR mutable:</strong> The default should be that values can be mutated
only if they are not aliased, and there should be no way to introduce
unsynchronized aliased mutation. However, the language should support
mutating values. The only way to get this is the rest of ownership and
borrowing, the distinction between borrows and mutable borrows and the
aliasing rules between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the core, commonly identified “hard part” of Rust - ownership
and borrowing - is essentially applicable for any attempt to make checking the
correctness of an imperative program tractable. So trying to get rid of it
would be missing the real insight of Rust, and not building on the foundations
Rust has laid out.</p>
<p>However, once you get away from that, there is must about Rust that is
<em>circumstantial</em> complexity, only because of Rust’s extensive efforts to
support a low-overhead high-control systems programming use case.</p>
<h2 id="how-rust-could-be-simpler-if-it-werent-a-systems-language">How Rust could be simpler if it weren’t a “systems” language</h2>
<p>The first thing I would do is abandon any guarantee about whether variables are
allocated on the stack or the heap. Rust has to provide users with this sort of
low level control to be viable in all the places that it is, but this is the
singular source of complexity that doesn’t contribute to the benefits of Rust I
described in the previous section. Like Go, the compiler will decide for you if
your variables go on the stack or the heap.</p>
<p>The main way this simplifies things is it allows ownership to be detatched
from representation. An owned, borrowed, and mutably borrowed <code>T</code> would all
share the same representation; they’re just type-level modifiers used to
determine what kind of control you have (an owned <code>T</code> is just a mutably
borrowed <code>T</code> that will drop at the end of this scope). Probably I would also
add a fourth modifier which is shared ownership, probably implemented via
garbage collection. These would have the same semantics as <code>Arc</code>, except that
it would be possible to implement them so that they don’t leak on cycles.</p>
<p>This would not simplify ownership and borrowing in any fundamental way, but I
believe it would eliminate a lot of the confusions people run into as they’re
getting the hang of ownership and borrowing. For example, there could be only
one string type.</p>
<p>The next change would to make trait objects the primary form of polymorphism.
Every trait would be object safe, and casting a type into a trait it implements
would be lightweight and easy because it can be heap-allocated by the compiler
behind the scenes. No more monomorphization (at least, except as an
optimization). Generics would exist only for creating polymorphic container
types, not as the main way of making polymorphic <em>functions</em>.</p>
<p>I would also take Rust’s commitment to concurrency-first and make all the
available primitives threadsafe. No <code>Rc</code>, no <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code>. Interior
mutability is only allowed through a mutex type, and everything can be moved
across threads. <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> would only exist as some built-in checks on
ownership-related types.</p>
<p>I think closures and arrays/vecs/slices could also be simplified a great deal
by not guaranteeing anything about where they’re allocated, though I haven’t
worked out all the details.</p>
<p>Such a language would almost certainly also use green threads, and have a
simple CSP/actor model like Go does. There’d be no reason to have “zero cost”
futures and async/await like we do in Rust. This would impose a runtime, but
that’s fine - we’re not creating a systems language. I already said earlier
that we’d probably have garbage collection, after all.</p>
<p>And there are also many things I’m not sure about. I’m not sure that basing the
interface polymorphism on Haskell type classes would be the best decision for
this language (though I love it for Rust). I’m not sure what kind of
metaprogramming facilities the language should have (I would <em>not</em> include
macro_rules-style macros without a long iterative design process that ours
did not get.) I’m not sure what I would change about cargo - probably nothing
fundamental, cargo is great.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing I’m unsure about - and the most controversial - is error
handling. I would probably experiment with exceptions if I were making this
language. I believe that all of the big problems with exceptions are solved by
those core benefits of Rust I described initially, which provide strong
guarantees that program state will be correctly cleaned up as a program
crashes, and correctly restored as the crash is halted. I think I would at
least make panicking the normal response to most IO failures. (Even with
exceptions users could still use Result for the kinds of errors exceptions
don’t make sense for).</p>
<p>I would expect this language to have performance characteristics similar to
Java or Go, and to be viable for all the use cases they are (plus on the front
end!) It would introduce some additional complexity in the form of ownership
and borrowing, but would not be nearly the slog for new users that Rust
currently is. And in exchange you would get a language which prevents a huge
class of errors that no other imperative language except Rust helps you with
today.</p>
<p>Finally, if I were creating a non-systems language today, even if I weren’t
taking this advice, I would do this one important additional thing. I would be
careful to design and implement the compiler so that it could be embedded in
different runtimes, and I would have two primary targets: an LLVM based one
creating a standalone binary on the mainstream UNIX and windows OSes, and a
WASM target that would be intended to use the host VM’s runtime for threads,
garbage collection, and so on. This is the best decision anyone creating a new
production-ready language in 2019 could make if they want to see widespread
adoption.</p>
<p>Oh and of course, I would implement this language and its runtime in Rust!</p>

<h2 id="yes-this-means-you-yes-this-means-now">Yes this means you, yes this means now</h2>

<p>The institutions that regulate elections in the US are ancient and under attack from all sides.
This includes everything from districting to polling places to the post office.
I think we should build a decentralized, Twitter-like platform to make election experts ‘uncancelable’ in case of a dispute in the US elections this fall.
The rest of this article is about how,
but this intro section is about why.</p>

<p>First, I saw historian Timothy Snyder’s <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?424912-2/timothy-snyder-discusses-on-tyranny">lecture about how free societies become un-free</a>.
He has a book about this and it’s short, probably shorter than the talk.
Snyder says, again and again throughout, sometimes out loud, sometimes to himself as a reminder, “Yes this means you. Yes this means now.”</p>

<p>The line stuck with me.</p>

<p>Second, I titled this ‘election week’ rather than ‘election night’ because I finally read the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/03/nation/transition-integrity-projects-full-report/">Transition Integrity Project report</a>.
The paper is about a tabletop simulation they ran with a group of experts to game out the season of misinformation that we’ll be in in November.
One of the conclusions is that because of a larger-than-normal amount of mail-in voting, the vote may not be decided in one night.
There may be a lot of uncertainty.</p>

<p>And third, Belarus used police violence against protestors and opposition candidates after a disputed election this week.
The weird thing about it for me is I’m not thinking ‘this wouldn’t happen in America’, but rather ‘this looks a lot like Portland’.</p>

<p>FWIW, here’s what our state dept <a href="https://www.state.gov/presidential-elections-in-belarus/">wrote about Belarus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>detentions of peaceful protesters and journalists marred the process</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>In Belarus, the protesters are using out-of-band or mesh networking apps to stay in touch as the state blocks access to social media (<a href="https://twitter.com/franakviacorka/status/1292840766369390595">source tweet</a>).
(Update: they <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/belarus-internet-outage-election/">blocked internet entirely</a> Sunday night, after some possible per-site blocks, and are dubiously blaming it on an external DDOS attack).</p>

<p><img src="https://abe-winter.github.io/assets/belarus-mesh.png" alt="tweet about mesh services used by belarusian protesters"></p>

<p>This article is about whether and how to build similar networks here.
In the case of a disputed election, we may need them – not even to organize protests, but for finding a palatable collective truth.</p>

<h2 id="which-mesh">Which mesh</h2>

<p>I don’t have the technical depth to answer this, but can at least raise some broad questions.</p>

<p><strong>Does it need to survive an internet outage?</strong>
It seems like in Belarus this week, the outages have been site-specific rather than the internet going down entirely.
If we expect decentralized social apps to continue working, running a physical mesh would be overkill.
Example: BitTorrent runs over the internet but uses ad-hoc discovery and network toplogy.
Or <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/04/07/bug-in-tech-for-antipreppers.html">Scuttlebutt</a> is a distributed messaging platform that has some cryptographic verification features built in and can use physical handoffs to route around network problems.</p>

<p>My sense is that <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/">Fediverse / ActivityPub</a> has some cross-node mention and access control features, but doesn’t use a distributed topology for content delivery, i.e. can be blocked by taking down one site.</p>

<p><strong>Should it run on nonstandard hardware?</strong>
This is a major tradeoff.
As I understand the space, the mesh network tools with longer range use the wifi chip rather than bluetooth.
But also, they don’t run on stock iPhones or Android devices.
Asking people to flash their phones is impossible for Apple hardware, and probably a non-standard for Android users.</p>

<p>There are hardware options like GoTenna and random single-board computers with big antennas,
but is there enough of a stock of these?
And I think some of them only have proprietary messaging protocols, they can’t run arbitrary traffic.</p>

<p>Another option is to collect all of people’s old linksys routers and flash those;
it’s a reasonable guess that some % of households has one or more spare wifi boxes.
I suspect wifi routers are the most commonly available flashable wifi hardware.</p>

<h2 id="sneakernet-and-neighbors">Sneakernet and neighbors</h2>

<p>My friends just moved to the suburbs and, as young parents on a block of young parents, the community formation is almost automatic.
They have a shared chat thread for everyone on the block and organize things like over-the-fence meetups and social distance porch drinks.
My point here is that community formation leads to norm formation, and if any kind of shit goes down, the people on this block will be listening to each other for information and interpretation.</p>

<p>One of the ‘things to do’ in the Tim Snyder talk was to shake hands and make eye contact.
It’s scary that one of these things is discouraged or unsafe now,
and the other is hard to do with only half your face visible.</p>

<p>I suspect the IRL isolation caused by lockdown has degraded neighbor-nets in some places,
and the lockdown-driven migration probably hasn’t helped.
(Though my newly-suburban friends migrated post-covid, so I may be wrong here).</p>

<p>Neighbor nets are especially important for an election-week mesh because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mesh networks rely on geography, so you need to have your neighbors on board</li>
  <li>In the case of jamming or other interference, sneakernet can replace a clogged digital network</li>
  <li>Digital information is in some ways less trustworthy than face to face discussion; if the digital information starts to seem weird, people can get together and talk</li>
  <li>In a ‘take to the streets’ outcome, having geographical concentrations of people who are aligned on the facts and on electoral values can suppress violence</li>
</ul>

<p>As this sort of network booted up, I imagine early adopters or node operators organizing sidewalk meet-and-greets to get a sense of each other.</p>

<h2 id="topologies-of-trust">Topologies of trust</h2>

<p>In a provocatively titled <a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/twitter-george-soros-and-porn">Twitter George Soros and Porn</a> newsletter from this week, this author’s well-read but very offline friends turned to Twitter for covid news because traditional media wasn’t ‘fast’ enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>he didn’t feel like he was getting reliable information from traditional media and had downloaded Twitter to try to find better information 🤯🤢. COVID is the most fast-moving, earth-shattering, difficult-to-comprehend thing imaginable and he logged onto Twitter for the first time in his life to find information about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was frustrating when he sent me the first Alex Berenson tweet. … Contact tracing is pointless, Sweden is doing it right …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He downloaded an app and assumed it worked as advertised. As Twitter proclaims on their landing page, they would help you “See what’s happening in the world right now”. … he shaped his idea of reality … with no real background on the underlying dynamics and mechanics of the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Confession time:
I joined twitter this March to get faster information about covid.
And now, 5 months later, I 1000% agree with this newsletter – it takes a while to understand how to read an account or community.</p>

<p>And also that Twitter isn’t vetted.
Nobody claims that it is, but we all have experiences where we realize exactly what that means.
I exited a futures position in March based on a tweet from a Politico journalist that was negative for stocks,
and the author followed up 5 minutes later with something like typo, sorry, left out the ‘not’.</p>

<p>‘Election-week mesh twitter’ won’t be immune to these problems.
But it has some advantages.
As a ‘single-issue’ social network, we can reimagine the blue checkmark and the approach to fact-checking.</p>

<p>Most of the users of this network won’t be publishing.
The ones who are will be carefully selected experts who will declare their area of expertise up-front.
That means, at minimum, there’s reputation risk for a cyber-security expert who is wrong in a big way.</p>

<p>It also means that there may be only 10 cyber-security experts on the thing, and they’ll all be weighing in on the same question.
Readers can build their personal conclusions based on the spread.
Also, they can check each other if they publish information before all the facts are available.</p>

<p>The goal of trust in general is more rapid consensus, at the cost of not being able to verify every claim or interpretation yourself.
Putting together groups of experts can give you a middle ground where you pick from a menu of expert opinions.</p>

<h2 id="truth-finding-vs-organizing-for-action">Truth-finding vs organizing for action</h2>

<p>Why orient this towards finding a consistent view of the truth rather than enabling action in case of an unfair election?</p>

<p>Two reasons:</p>

<p>First, you can’t, or at least shouldn’t, make the decision to protest unless you have the truth.
A fair election that achieves an undesired outcome is the best we can ask for, and the best we can demand.</p>

<p>Second, truth is, or at least should be, something that all sides want in an American election dispute.
Building a resilient, high-tech, grass-roots national institution that achieves this should be a common goal.
If it isn’t, we might as well start the civil war today.</p>

<h2 id="legal-protections-for-mesh-networks">Legal protections for mesh networks</h2>

<p>The TIP paper points out that whoever is currently behind the desk can use the apparatus of power to warp the election outcome.
Here are some ways that could happen and some other ways to protect against this kind of interference.</p>

<p>If the network runs over normal internet, ISPs can be compelled to block it, or to shut down entirely.
Power companies can be compelled to shut down power, although I think that would backfire because it would send people onto the street and force them to build local coalitions.</p>

<p>If the network runs on software that’s in the app store, it can be taken out of the app store by exerting pressure on Apple and Google.
If it’s sideloaded on Android devices, vendors can be pressured to release updates that block it, although I suspect this is harder to do;
it takes between 6 months and never to plumb security updates through the diverse Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>If local wifi or bluetooth is the transport, these things can be jammed, but if it’s done by police or with regulated equipment, this too can be challenged in court.</p>

<p>There needs to be a legal armor …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

alt=""></figure><p>Earnings for high-growth companies <strong>beat analyst estimates by 7% on average </strong>(median 5.7%).<strong> </strong>This is a huge discrepancy on a quarterly basis, and across a year can sum up to &gt; 20% difference. The conservative nature of these estimates downplay the quality and consistency of growth, and will make growth companies look more expansive relative to future revenue when using them.</p><p>Knowing these estimates are consistently off for growth companies, you might ask are there better ways to estimate forward revenue than these expensive analyst estimates?</p><p>While working in VC, I heard of a concept called <em>growth persistence </em>from <a href="https://www.scalevp.com/blog/predictable-growth-decay-in-saas-companies">Scale Venture Partner's blog</a>:</p><blockquote>As a rule of thumb, therefore, <strong>next year's growth rate is likely to be 85% of what this year's was</strong></blockquote><p>For example, if you have a company that grew 50% this year, we can expect it to grow &nbsp;42.5% the next year.</p><p>I often used this concept to estimate forward revenue when I didn't have access to analyst estimates. To generate a <em>growth persistence estimate</em>, I took the growth rate of the corresponding quarter from the previous year , multiplied it by 0.85, and solved for the implied revenue. With the Public Comps data, I can analyze the effectiveness of the growth persistence estimate.</p><p>The median <em>growth persistence</em> (revenue growth / last year revenue growth) in our data is consistent with this rule (85.4%). I then experimented with how accurate the growth persistence estimates were compared to the actual revenue. </p><figure><img

The mean beat was reduced to 1.7% and 4.5% respectively, <strong>while the median actual revenue beats were both &lt; 1%.</strong> It's incredible how much more accurate using this simple rule is over consensus estimates. This rule requires only two data points (previous revenue growth &amp; previous revenue) that you get almost a year before the earnings, while sell-side analyst have months of research up until the earnings release.</p><p>While using analyst estimates is a common practice, it is known that these estimates are conservative, and especially so for high-growth companies. Even simple calculations like the growth persistence estimates have outperformed them. While they are useful data-points for understanding an investment, the buyers &amp; sellers of these assets are often predicting revenue earnings at higher values, and incorporating other <a href="https://blog.publiccomps.com/top-5-saas-metrics/">key SaaS metrics</a> in their decisions.</p><p>When looking at the expensive EV/forward revenue multiples for growth companies, remember it's a little cheaper than meets the eye.</p><p>If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns, feel free to shoot me an email!</p><p>Howard Chen, Public Comps Team</p><p>howard@publiccomps.com</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Chowybear">https://twitter.com/Chowybear</a></p><p><em><em>Like t</em>his analysis<em>? </em>S<em>ubscribe to the </em></em><a href="https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ulp4knn6f9h86d97tq/25h2hohoqn5p8q/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJsaWNjb21wcy5jay5wYWdlLzY4YjQ2NWQwYzk="><em><em>newsletter here</em></em></a><em><em> where we send out investment memos, market maps and analysis on the broader SaaS market.</em></em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The author owns stock directly in AYX, CRWD, TEAM, TWLO, AMZN, FB, DDOG, ESTC, and ZM.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a happy user of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> both on my private
computers and on my work laptop. I even managed to get through four years of
university with my setup, and only had to bring a Windows machine on some rare
occasions, even though some professors are openly hostile towards a Linux setup.
(It doesn't run Microsoft Project and the real Excel, after all…)</p>
<p>Recently, I got interested in the BSDs, especially in
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and in <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.
Even though OpenBSD with its minimalistic appeal is better suited to my taste,
I'm currently looking at FreeBSD for a couple of reasons. First, I have to
maintain a storage server (a FreeBSD box using ZFS) at work. Second, I've also
built up a storage server at home. FreeBSD gives me the things I need mostly out
of the box: ZFS with redundancy on really cheap hardware. And third, I just like
to learn new things.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to learning new things in my spare time, I'd rather spend
my time on something that will be useful in the long run. I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy
Effect</a> as a guide: Technologies
like Kubernetes, the latest JavaScript framework, or Web Assembly have only been
around for a couple of years, and it's possible that those will undergo major
changes or vanish alltogether as fast as they came. Older technologies <em>that are
still around nowadays</em>, on the other hand, can be expected to be around for many
more years. Examples are the C programming language, various Unix shells, and ‒
FreeBSD. (I also make exceptions to this rule now and then. For example, I
learned Go and Rust in the summers of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Go, which had
its 1.0 release earlier than Rust, proofed to be the more stable choice.)</p>
<p>FreeBSD is now more than 25 years old. Its roots, however, go back to AT&amp;T's
original Unix from the 1970s. (All the code has been replaced or rewritten
since.) Being old is not enough, of course; a technology is only worthwhile
learning if it is still alive. Even though FreeBSD is rarely on the front page
of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, it is still widely used.
<a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2019/fosdem/looney-netflix_and_freebsd/">Netflix</a>
streams videos through FreeBSD systems, and the operating system of the
PlayStation 4, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4_system_software">Orbis
OS</a>, is based on
FreeBSD.</p>
<p>FreeBSD is not only likely to stay around for a long time, it probably also
won't undergo fundmental changes very soon or very often. One example is the
startup system of FreeBSD, which is still based on <code>init</code> and <code>rc</code> scripts.
Ubuntu, on the other side, switched from SysVinit to Upstart in 2006, and again
from Upstart to systemd in 2015. That is one init system to learn for a lifetime
(FreeBSD) vs. three in less than a decade (Ubuntu).</p>
<p>Documentation is another advantage of FreeBSD. Having a system that rarely
introduces breaking changes makes it easier and more worthwile to provide good
documentation. The FreeBSD team not only provides good <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">manual
pages</a>, but also a well curated
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/">FAQs</a>, a
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/">Wiki</a>, and the very useful
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">Handbook</a>.
FreeBSD material has such a long shelf life so that it is even worthwhile to
print books about that operating system. I'm reading <a href="https://nostarch.com/absfreebsd3">Absolute
FreeBSD</a> now (from front to back, that is).
Michael Warren Lucas, the author of this book, has written <a href="https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product-category/tech/">even more
books</a> on FreeBSD
(and OpenBSD), which are not only useful and of high-quality, but also
well-written and fun to read.</p>
<p>As I started to work with FreeBSD, I suddenly realized what the term
«distribution» is probably supposed to mean: Not just a bunch of software
cobbled together with more or less frequent upgrades, but an entire operating
system that not only provides working software, but also the means to build that
very software on a standard installation. (Such a system is technically
described as <em>self hosting</em>.) A kernel can be compiled and installed with a
single command. Thanks to the ports tree, the packages can be compiled easily
and in a consistent way. I haven't tried <em>all</em> Linux distributions, of course,
but quality standards that high are certainly not the rule in the GNU/Linux
world. (Debian and Arch, the Linux distributions I use the most and know the
best, are still absolutely great operating systems.)</p>

<p>It's safe to say that FreeBSD is a good choice for servers in a Unix
environment. But does it also work well on a desktop computer? And is it even an
option for the kind of desktop I like to run: not GNOE, KDE, or Xfce, but a
minimalistic setup based on <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, which probably
isn't used by many. Since dwm can only be configured by modifying the <code>config.h</code>
file, I won't be able to use the version from the ports tree. I use my desktop
computer mainly for work (programming, reading, writing, researching information
on the internet) and some entertainment mostly provided through the web browser
(reading, videos).</p>
<p>I generally use mid-range commodity hardware with on-board graphics, so hardware
compatibility should not be an issue. My desktop computer is a small-form Dell
OptiPlex 7040 from 2016 with an Intel Core i5 CPU. I replaced the original 128
TB SSD with a 500 GB model last year, and upgraded the original 8 GB of memory
with a ridiculous amount of 24 GB. (Some RAM bars just happened to lay around
here…) The computer has a WiFi card, of course, but since my router is just next
to my desk, I rather use a stable ethernet connection.</p>
<p>I already tried out OpenBSD once on that computer, and didn't have any issues
getting it to run. So FreeBSD having access to the same code base under the BSD
license is likely to suppport this hardware as well. Let's just try it out!</p>

<p>FreeBSD supports multiple versions at any given point in time. At the time of
this writing, 12.1 and 11.4 are the current versions intended for production.
Let's pick the most recent version 12.1. The <a href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/">download
page</a>
for the <code>amd64</code> architecture offers various options. The compressed
<code>mini-memstick</code> archive weighs the least and provides everything that is needed
for an installation on a computer with internet connection. I download it to my
laptop running Arch Linux, and then verify the checksum:</p>
<pre><code>$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64\
/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/\
ISO-IMAGES/12.1/CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64
$ sha512sum -c CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64 --ignore-missing
FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz: OK
</code></pre>
<p>The archive (389 MBs) needs to be unpacked and is then copied to a USB dongle
(<code>/dev/sda</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ unxz FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
# dd if=FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M
$ sync
</code></pre>

<p>The BIOS is setup to use UEFI rather than legacy boot. I plug in the USB dongle
and start the FreeBSD installer. These are the settings I use during setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keymap: Swiss-German (<code>ch.kdb</code>)</li>
<li>Hostname: <code>optiplex</code> (I'm not very imaginative when it comes to naming
  things.)</li>
<li>Components: just <code>lib32</code>, <code>ports</code>, and <code>src</code></li>
<li>Network: interface <code>em0</code> with DHCP and IPv4</li>
<li>Mirror: Main Site</li>
<li>Partitioning: Auto (UFS, I'm going to learn about ZFS later) on the entire
  disk <code>ada0</code> using GPT and the following partitions (device, space, type,
  label, mount point):<ul>
<li><code>ada0p1</code>: 200 MB <code>efi</code> boot (no mount point)</li>
<li><code>ada0p2</code>: 24 GB <code>freebsd-swap</code> swap0 (no mount point, size of physical memory)</li>
<li><code>ada0p3</code>: 16 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> root <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p4</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> temp <code>/tmp</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p5</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> var <code>/var</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p6</code>: 32 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> usr <code>/usr</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p7</code>: 386 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> home <code>/home</code> (remainder of the space)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root password: I won't tell you, but a strong one!</li>
<li>CMOS clock: UTC</li>
<li>Time Zone: Europe/Switzerland (<code>CEST</code>)</li>
<li>Services: <code>sshd</code>, <code>moused</code>, <code>ntpd</code>, <code>powerd</code>, and <code>dumpdev</code></li>
<li>Security Hardening Options: everything</li>
<li>User: <code>patrick</code> with additional group <code>wheel</code> (to become root), the <code>tcsh</code>
  shell, a strong password, and, otherwise, suggested settings</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be argued if the chosen partition sizes are reasonable. However, it is
always a good idea to use separate <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/var</code> partitions to make sure
that no process can fill up the entire disk. (Using a separate <code>/usr</code> partition
is an issue on Linux nowadays, since the widely used init system systemd
requires access to <code>/usr</code>. On FreeBSD, it is still possible to do so without any
issues.)</p>
<p>Make sure to use <code>efi</code> as the type for the boot partition, not <code>freebsd-boot</code> as
suggested in <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> (3rd Edition on page 36).</p>

<p>After the installation, I choose to shutdown the system. I unplug my USB dongle
as soon as the screen turns black.</p>
<p>Before the first boot, I have to change my boot options in the BIOS so that the
computer boots from the SSD on which FreeBSD was just installed.</p>
<p>The system boots and even shows my mouse on the terminal! The network is up and
running. However, there is a message warning me that the leapsecond file is
expired. The
<a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/leapseconds-file-expired.56645/post-322290">solution</a> suggested in the FreeBSD Forum</p>
<pre><code># service ntpd onefetch
</code></pre>
<p>fails with a certificate verification error. A <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=230017">bug
report</a> suggest to
install the package <code>ca_root_nss</code>:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install ca_root_nss
</code></pre>
<p>Which not only installs the package management software, but also solves the
issue above: The warning concerning the leapsecond file doesn't appear after the
next boot. Now that the basic system is up and running, let's tackle the GUI!</p>

<p>Since <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> doesn't cover graphical user interfaces, I have to
resort to the handbook. In <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x-install.html">Chapter
5.3</a> it says that the
easiest way to setup the X Window System is to install the <code>xorg</code> package. Since
I prefer a minimalistic setup, I opt for the <code>x11/xorg-minimal</code> package instead:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install x11/xorg-minimal
</code></pre>
<p>This package depends on Python 3.7, Perl 5, and Wayland, among others, and
weighs roughly 1 GB, which is not exactly minimalistic in my opinion. On the
other hand, it is notable that the base setup works without Perl or Python.
(Which <em>is</em> minimalistic.)</p>
<h2>Compiling <code>dwm</code></h2>
<p>Since I like to keep my <code>dwm</code> version up to date, I fetch the sources using
<code>git</code>, which first needs to be installed:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install git
# git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
</code></pre>
<p>A first naive compilation attempt fails:</p>
<pre><code># cd dwm
# make
drw.c:5:10: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found
#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>config.mk</code> file expects the header …</p></div></div>

August 11, 2020 | https://www.maheshblog.in/2020-08-02-beginner-guide-to-start-blog-using-gatsby | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.maheshblog.in/2020-08-02-beginner-guide-to-start-blog-using-gatsby">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, there are numerous options to setup a blog. We have out of box options like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> with thousands of plugins to get started. But nothing beats the satisfaction of building something from scratch for yourself. Advantages include understanding of blog under the hood and flexibility to tailor it to your needs. Bonus is you have a playground to code and test out different ideas, designs and colors.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Need any web browser like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/">Chrome</a> etc</li>
<li>git : code repository : <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
<li>basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basics first</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> is a static site generator frameworks. It uses React, <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> and basic web languages of HTML, JS and CSS. We don't have to understand GraphQL or React completely to get started but working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS can speed up the progress.</p>
<p>In short, Gatsby takes the code and converts into static site. Once you push code to Github git repository, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> will deploy automatically.</p>
<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>Enough of reading text, lets get started by installing and setting up environment locally. This is one time effort so worthy to get it done initially.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>any text editor (I recommend to install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual studio code</a>)</li>
<li>nodejs : <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a></li>
<li>create a git repo in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></li>
<li>
<p>Preliminary checks to do in command line or shell:</p>
<ul>
<li>is git working?</li>
</ul>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="bash" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">git --version</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<ul>
<li>is npm available?</li>
</ul>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="bash" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">npm -v</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can copy paste the following shell script to get started:</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="bash" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
cd gatsby-site
gatsby develop</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<p>or you can follow these instructions from Gatsby quick start in step-by-step: <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start</a></p>
<p>You can hit browser url : <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a> to see blog without any changes and push the code to git repository in Github.</p>
<p>Voila! you are one step closer to Gatsby based blog.</p>
<h2>Add firsts</h2>
<p>Gatsby creates pages for each of the posts and pages in the blog. There should be already bunch of sample pages for functioning site. So, you can add new html page in pages folder and it automatically accessible in the site without any other changes</p>
<h3>First page: Contact page</h3>
<p>Create new file: <strong>contact.js</strong> in <strong>pages</strong> folder with following content:</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="jsx" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">import React from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

const ContactPage = ({ data, location }) =&gt; {
	return &lt;Layout location={location}&gt;You can contact at dummy@mail.com&lt;/Layout&gt;
}

export default ContactPage</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<p>You can browse here: <a href="http://localhost:8000/contact">http://localhost:8000/contact</a></p>
<h3>First blog post</h3>
<p>Create new file: <strong>first-post/index.md</strong> with following content:</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="markdown" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">---
title: First blog
date: '2015-05-01T22:12:03.284Z'
description: 'First blog'
---

This is my first post.</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<p>You can browse here: <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a> and search for "First blog" for your post link.</p>
<p>Congratulations! now, you got a working blog and push all changes to Github repo.</p>
<h2>Deploy online using Netlify</h2>
<p>Now lets deploy the blog and make it available online. Lets use Netlify and go ahead with sign up here: <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">https://app.netlify.com/</a></p>
<p>Once you sign up and login, its a straight forward setup to deploy and here is the summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect Github</li>
<li>Pick repository</li>
<li>Leave the default options as they are in Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>Netlify generates url for your blog and you are all set with auto deployment of blog with any change made to Github repo.</p>
<p>There might be other deployment options for static sites but here are some of the features that I liked in Netlify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Custom domain</li>
<li>Free SSL</li>
</ul>
<p>We can explore on these some other time🙂</p>
<p>Now, you are all set for new working site to add posts and have a blog for yourself.</p>

	<h2>The Full Scoop</h2>
<p>I had the opportunity yesterday to attend a CEO roundtable meeting.&nbsp; This group meeting was unique in that historically it has always met in person, but this time we met virtually.&nbsp; We felt it was still important to gather together, seek advice, and counsel; to drive towards that never ending goal of continuous improvement.&nbsp; Now more than ever, we must make the time to engage and collaborate with strong and able partners.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, a topic that received plenty of attention was COVID-19.&nbsp; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a syndrome called, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).&nbsp; All of our daily routines have been unended, and we are quickly learning we will need to adapt our daily habits to navigate through the upcoming weeks and months.&nbsp; Everyone is working hard to create flexibility for their employees that ensures their health, while we find new and creative ways to responding to the needs of our customers.</p>
<p>One topic that stood out was Attitude.&nbsp; A group member made a wonderful point in stating, "Don' talk about problems, view them as challenges, that you can and will overcome."&nbsp; Now is not the time to slow down, become discouraged, or talk constantly about "problems".&nbsp; Yes we have challenges, but humankind always has been faced with challenges, which when viewed through the proper lens - creates new opportunities for those willing to put in the time, effort and sweat.</p>
<p>Now more than ever is the time to show our employees, customers and vendors that we are willing and able to move through these challenging times.&nbsp; Your resolve as a leader will bring the confidence your team needs to overcome new obstacles, and outshine the competition.&nbsp; These issues will subside, they will be replaced by new challenges, which if we are willing and able to be open minded learners - we will also overcome.&nbsp; Stay positive.</p>

  Real-time data is incredibly valuable and actionable but organizations still face 
  obstacles in their path to real-time analytics. Instant personalization, fraud fighting, 
  support operations, large scale A/B testing— all have requirements beyond what a traditional 
  or cloud data stack can provide. In this talk, Rockset Co-founder and CEO Venkat Venkataramani will show how a real-time A/B experiments system can be built at massive scale in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
  Based on experience from scaling real-time A/B experiments systems at facebook, we find that real-time A/B experiments platforms ideally have the following requirements: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Speed with scalable real-time ingest: This will help product teams make decisions in days instead of weeks. The faster results arrive, the more experiments product teams will run.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to analyze multi-dimensional data: Almost every part of A/B testing analysis involves JOINing the real-time event stream with one or more fact tables such as users, products, devices or experiments data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sub-second queries with interactive slicing &amp; dicing: Product teams need to drill-down and interrogate the data in an interactive fashion to build new hypotheses, constructs better ideas and design follow-up experiments.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Venkat will introduce Rockset, a real-time indexing database in the cloud, and show how its schemaless ingestion, full-featured SQL, and cloud scalability can be used to build a real-time A/B experiments system that meets these requirements.

<![CDATA[The Surprising Value or Catching Up and Getting Ahead]]>

<p>Imagine a race between two people. They are moving at the same exact speed. The only difference is that one of them got a 10-second headstart. That person has the advantage of being ahead the entire race, even though they are doing the exact same thing, moving at the exact same speed. They are always winning while the other person is always losing. Now imagine that race is not a simple sprint or even a marathon, but a race as long as life. This illustrates the unthinkable advantage of getting ahead. It is no harder for the person with the headstart to maintain their lead than it is for the person losing the entire way to maintain the distance they trail behind. In fact, it may in some cases be easier to stay ahead.</p>



<p>Another way to help illustrate this point is to look at the difference between savings and debt. Imagine two people both earn the same breakeven income to cover their same costs of living. The only difference is that one person starts with a little bit of savings and the other person starts with a little bit of debt. This small initial difference in their wealth will not only remain over time — it will actually grow much larger. The first person’s savings work for them, earning them interest over time. The second person’s debt works against them, charging them interest over time. Keep in mind, they are both earning the same income to cover the same costs of living the entire time. In this case, it is significantly easier for the person with the headstart to maintain their advantage than it is for the other person to maintain the amount by which they trail behind. Even if they both do the exact same thing over the long haul, the advantage granted by the initial headstart only increases over time.</p>



<p>This phenomenon applies in a number of other areas as well. Instead of thinking of it as the difference in a competition between two people, one can also think of it as the difference between two possible versions of oneself.</p>



<p>For example, one can lose the weight they want to lose in a relatively short period of time and then maintain a lower weight for years with no more effort than they would have needed to maintain their old heavier weight over time. All else equal, that person can enjoy the benefit of being in better shape for the rest of their life all because they put in some extra work for a short time to get down to their target weight just once.</p>



<p>This is the value of catching up and getting ahead. An early advantage can offer a lead for life. By putting in the short-term work in various areas to catch up and then get ahead, one can stay ahead in all of these areas without any more long-term effort in each, and often with less. This allows them to move on to catching up and getting ahead in other areas. The virtuous cycle continues.</p>



<p>Humans seem hardwired to always be behind. In school, kids do not do all of their assignments a week before they are due. They do them all the night before they are due. Most people tend to focus on not getting too far behind rather than on catching up and getting ahead. They fail to realize that it would often take the same or less effort to maintain a lead as it does the deficit. </p>



<p>Catching up and getting ahead is not necessarily easy, but once it is done, it is just as easy to stay ahead as it would have been to stay where one started. Catching up and getting ahead of wherever one is at the moment takes less time than that over which the benefits of doing so may be enjoyed. Get some leads in life. It is no harder and often easier to stay ahead than it is to stay behind. Why keep losing when you could just as easily keep winning? Catch up. Get ahead.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR;</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I use ad blockers. YouTube flagged my account and devices. I can only watch
around 1 in 4 videos. So I wrote a Telegram bot that receives YouTube URLs and
replies back with the video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>I use adblockers to have a semi-decent experience on the Internet. I mainly use
UBlock Origin plus some DNS ones. One nice feature of UBlock Origin is that it
does block ads from YouTube videos. On my phone I uninstalled the YouTube app
and watch videos mostly through Firefox.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their algorithms detected that I do not watch their ads so all my
accounts and devices seem flagged. I’m not completely banned, but I can’t see
more than half of the videos.</p>

<p>Before you come tell me I am inmoral for not watching the ads that many creators
need to make a living, let me point some things out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the content I follow I already support via Patreon (I spend around 80
USD bucks a month supporting those people)</li>
<li>Even being a supporter, most of the content gets published exclusively to
YouTube.</li>
<li>A lot of the videos I can’t watch do not even have ads</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I’m not complaining about being flagged. Best case scenario, I come up
with away to workaround their restrictions by building tools which is what I
enjoy doing anyways… worst case scenario, I can’t never ever watch YouTube;
I can live with that.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like when I try to watch a video:</p>

<p><img src="https://cristian.io/you-shall-no-tube.jpg" alt="you shall no tube"></p>

<p>And for videos that I can watch, the comment section displays:</p>

<pre><code>Restricted Mode has hidden comments for this video.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="my-solution-for-now-at-least">My solution (for now at least)</h2>

<p>I noticed that what seems to be blocked are the devices/accounts that I have
used, but the videos are accessible and even downloadable from other other
locations (even from the same network). So this is my plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a Telegram bot that receives YouTube urls</li>
<li>The bot downloads the video (using <code>youtube-dl</code>)</li>
<li>Then the bot replies back with the video attached as a file</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cristian.io/youtube-bot.png" alt="bot shot"></p>

<p><strong>Source code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/casidiablo/youtube-telegram-bot">https://github.com/casidiablo/youtube-telegram-bot</a></p>



<ul>
<li>It’s likely that I will hit file size limits of Telegram. To upload big videos
I might need to split them using <code>ffmpeg</code></li>
<li>I could make it so that the bot subscribes to the channels I follow and
automatically send me those videos.</li>
<li>The code itself of this bot was adapted from another bot I run that, given a
YouTube URL, downloads the video, encodes it in MP3 and publishes it to a
private Podcast feed. I use it to listen to stuff where video is just a
distraction (conferences, speeches, etc.)</li>
<li>I also run another bot that feeds my Plex server with non-YouTube videos
procured from… from nice people out there.</li>
</ul>

Try to picture Abraham Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg address or MLK Jr. giving his “I have a dream” speech... with a slideshow. It’s absurd.</p><p>All business before 1987 was conducted without PowerPoint. No horrendous charts, crappy colors, uneven shapes and poorly aligned text boxes…it existed! And people still succeeded at conveying messages!&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Ask senior colleagues what they did before PPT and they will tell you they actually had to PREPARE for presentations and condense their messages down, rather than create 150 slides for a deck that wouldn’t ever see the light of day again.</p><p>Preparation starts well before the presentation itself. Here are some quick tips:</p><p>1. <strong>Research your audience.</strong> Understand who will be in the room and how the room is physically set up. You don’t want to be caught off guard by someone you didn’t expect to show up, or in a room that was <em>supposed to have</em> a functioning projector but doesn’t. -</p><p>2. <strong>Begin with the end in mind.</strong> If your audience only walks away with ONE message, what would you want it to be? Tie everything you present into that. If it helps, think about a little airplane flying around the room with a banner attached to the tail - what would the banner say that you want everyone to remember?</p><p>3. <strong>Be thoughtful about your use of slides.</strong> People can read, so putting a bunch of text on a slide isn't helpful. Slides should add something to the presentation that an e-mail or hand-out cannot like video, audio, GIFS, etc.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1585656241287_39527"><div>

GE pays training companies big bucks to work with aspiring executives on developing skills like executive presence, negotiations, finance, and many others.</p><p>One of the most influential sessions I attended was taught by Rob Brown, a world-renowned networking and public speaking expert. He taught us a very simple lesson: to be an effective business executive you must train yourself to speak clearly, simply, and concisely. It's not easy. It takes practice.</p><p>I'll never forget his mantra, which didn't make sense to many of us when he first said it:</p><p><strong>'Why use a policeman in an automobile when a cop in a car will do?'&nbsp;</strong>In other words, why use fancy and excessive words when a much simpler message will work?&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us immediately thought, 'No shit, Rob... GE paid you how much money to tell us not to use fluffy language when we speak?'</p><p>But the idea goes far beyond that. As you can tell from the 'policeman and automobile' line, you have options. Cop in a car is the simplest. A uniformed officer in blue from Montgomery county perched atop his leather seat inside a pearl white cruiser is another. </p><p>Forcing yourself to 'cut the crap' and get to the heart of an idea does many important things:</p><p>1. It forces you to think clearly about the presentation, project, or challenge you are working on and find helpful, simple solutions.</p><p>2. It reduces the risk of miscommunication among colleagues, ESPECIALLY for those who are working remote or are working in a non-native language.</p><p>3. It is actually more impressive, not less, to avoid using buzzwords and corporate jargon.</p><p>Using excessive vocabulary and lengthy sentences does nothing but waste people's valuable time in a meeting that's already running 5 minutes over.</p><p>Here's a challenge: Force yourself not to use the words or phrases 'perspective, at the end of the day, standpoint, synergy, capture, boil the ocean, bandwidth, etc...' for an entire day.&nbsp;</p><p>Encourage your teammates to stop you when you do and make you start over again. See how it goes. I bet it's much more difficult than you thought.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1585656241287_53309"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>To use the ebay kleinanzeigen api (e.g. with <a href="https://github.com/tejado/ebk-client/">ebk-client</a>) an application username and an application
password is required.
However there are only two options to get this:</p>
<ol>
<li>send a mail to <strong>api@ebay-kleinanzeigen.de</strong> and never get a response or</li>
<li>find the working credentials yourself in applications which must store the
credentials</li>
</ol>
<p>This blog post describes the second approach, however you will have to to the
steps yourself and maybe even learn something as the "answer" is not stored here.
If you are unwilling to follow the steps, you are probably not worthy to use
the ebay kleinanzeigen api.</p>

<div id="getting-the-application">
<h2>Getting the application</h2>
<p>You will have to get the ebay kleinanzeigen apk from somewhere, i chose to
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ebay+kleinanzeigen+apk&amp;ia=web">duckduckgo "ebay kleinanzeigen apk"</a></p>
<p>Download the app and put it in the current working directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="unpacking-the-apk-layers">
<h2>Unpacking the apk layers</h2>
<p>I use <strong>apktool</strong> and <strong>dex2jar</strong> to unpack the apk</p>
<div><pre><span></span>apktool d -r -s eBay_Kleinanzeigen.apk
<span>cd</span> eBay_Kleinanzeigen
d2j-dex2jar ./classes.dex --force
</pre></div>
</div>
<div id="finding-the-credentials">
<h2>Finding the credentials</h2>
<p>Once unpacked we simply have to find the credentials somewhere in the code.</p>
<p>At first we open <strong>./classes-dex2jar.jar</strong> with the java disassembler:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jd-gui ./classes-dex2jar.jar
</pre></div>
<p>and now we can use the search to find the loot:</p>

Imagine if dinner was carted into this room, and four people got half the food. The night would end in violence," Anand Giridharadas told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed at a public event hosted by <a href="https://www.samaracanada.com/" target="_blank">the Samara Centre for Democracy</a>.</p>  <p>"But somehow you scale it up to the level of the society &nbsp;— millions and millions of people — and you make it money instead of food, and people are like,&nbsp;'Yeah I guess that's okay,'" Giridharadas added.</p>  <p>The journalist and author has been investigating how global elites in the U.S. have been "changing the world" and dominating the news with their efforts. In his book&nbsp;<em>Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World</em>, Giridharadas lays out how the the rich and powerful have been fighting for equality and injustice, branding themselves as socially engaged agents of change and pouring millions — if not trillions — of tax-avoided dollars into social causes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But, he warns, in all of this good, their role in causing the problems they later seek to solve is obscured.</p>  <p>"If all these people on the top are doing all this nice stuff, but year by year they are increasing their concentration of wealth and power, their monopolies are getting more monopolistic, their tech companies are becoming more abusive of privacy and democracy —&nbsp;not less —&nbsp;if their influence over politics is increasing, not decreasing, then what is all this do-gooding doing?"&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'If only' solutions</h2>  <p>The New York University professor argues that the conventional wisdom out there to solve the world's problems stems from an "if only" approach, suggesting maybe there needs to be more than just one Mark Zuckerberg to fix this.</p>  <p>"If only we had an effective altruism movement, so that when you give money away you could be guided to give it more rationally. If you give it to this NGO, it will have more impact than if you give it to that one. If only Chinese billionaires could be persuaded to donate philanthropically at the same percentage that American billionaires do," he explained.</p>  <p>"If only, if only, if only."</p>  <p>This "if only" solution got Giridharadas thinking about an equal and opposite possibility.</p>  <p>"Maybe all this extraordinary elite helping in our time is how we maintain a system — an architecture of extraordinary elite hoarding," he told Ayed.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>'While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do ... is to start joining things.

Why should the decisions be left to permitting the rich to decide what's important — a hospital wing, a legal aid centre, a new well in the village? These are decisions that should involve everyone, including elected representatives and governments, Giridharadas argues.</p>  <p>When the rich and powerful not only get involved in change but get into the front row of social change, "they change 'change,'" said the former McKinsey analyst.</p>  <p>"They change what kinds of change are acceptable. They change the discourse we have about change."</p>  <h2>Make democracy</h2>  <p>If the institutions that are set up aren't to be trusted, Giridharadas proposes it's time to build better institutions — this time, from the bottom up.</p>  <p>He sees a possibility to make democracy better by organizing the world differently.</p>  <p>"While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do — today, tomorrow and the next day — is to start joining things," he told Ayed.</p>  <p>Giridharadas calls on people to join organizations, membership lists and movements that work toward building cross-racial, cross-class coalitions of people — with a goal to create a future that benefits most people.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If we build movements to that effect, I think we can end this age of capital. I think we can usher in the age of reform and I think we can resume the idea of democracy as the place we go to change the world."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>* This episode was produced by Philip Coulter.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Because air flow can’t (easily) be seen, newcomers are tempted to use mental models informed by the visible world to speculate on how it behaves. Unfortunately, this intuition often falls short.</p>
<h2 id="intuition-vs-reality">
  Intuition vs. Reality

<p>Depicted below is how one would expect air to move around a sphere, with the flow behaving like individual particles that bounce off of the surface. This is known as a “bullet model”.
<img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/BM.png" alt="Flow_Wrong"></p>
<p>However, even with this basic flow, intuition is unreliable, as the bullet model is incorrect. The object does act as an obstacle, but fluids flow <em>around</em> things, and not at them. The fluid flows around the body because, in a sense, it has ‘advance warning’ that something is coming, so it reacts early and gets out of the way. Below is a more accurate depiction of the flow.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/RF.png" alt="Flow_Right"></p>
<p>This distinction may seem obvious, but consider that even the father of modern mathematics and physics, Isaac Newton, incorrectly based his theories of aerodynamics on the bullet model.</p>
<p>Correcting this misconception is an important first step in calibrating an instinct for aerodynamics.</p>

<p>The distinction between streamlined &amp; bluff bodies becomes significant when assessing the drag force acting upon each shape. If the streamlined body is used as baseline, the size of the arrows signifies the relative drag force acting on each one:</p>

<p>Where does a car fall on the streamlined/bluff spectrum?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/CAR_3.png" alt="Car_CFD"></p>
<p>The automobile has exhibited bluff characteristics for much of its existence. In the past, the customer requirements (aesthetics, interior &amp; cargo room, styling, powertrain packaging..etc) were not in line with the design direction needed to minimize drag. However, with evermore stringent regulations mandating higher fuel efficiency, many features of the streamlined body are now adopted by conventional automobiles.</p>

<p>As a result of the increased attention to aerodynamics, modern road cars have impressively low drag coefficients compared to their counterparts from even just two decades ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  The drag coefficient quantifies the amount of resistance a given shape feels, with lower being better.
</blockquote>

<p>Going forward, auto manufacturers are experimenting with novel methods to incorporate even more features of the streamlined body into the automobile form. For example, the Mercedes Concept IAA has a deployable rear tail extension to further taper it’s trailing edge. This results in a flow field remarkably similar to that of the ideal streamlined shape.</p>

  Concluding Thoughts

</h2>
<p>In review, the same general flow pattern of divergence followed by convergence exists around all objects. However, there is a distinction between streamlined and bluff objects, classifications that fall on two opposite ends of the spectrum. Most real world geometries lie somewhere on that gradient, borrowing features from both.</p>
<p>This article speaks to <em>how</em> the flow generally behaves. <a href="https://www.worksaero.com/docs/fundamentals/energy/">Continue to Part II</a>, where the discussion turns to the mechanisms by which a fluid can accumulate and deploy energy, which begins to answer the <em>why</em>.</p>

They go deep into a topic, or more briefly over a bunch of them. Although, as a Software Engineer, I learned a lot from blog posts, tweets, and conference talks, it was books that prepared me for the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/tech-lead-everything-software-engineers-need-to-know-to-become-a-great-technology-leader">Tech Lead role</a>.</p>
<p>For this article, I created a list of 3 classic books I consider essential for whose transitioning — or desires to transition — to a leadership position in technology.</p>
<p>Books can teach us many things. It’s familiar to us to feel like there’re too many things to learn and too little time to absorb it. We tend to get anxious and overloaded with the content easily. Relax.</p>
<p>Take your time on reading, and take your time practicing it. Theory and practice converge at some point, and you realize you’ve been a leader for quite some time.</p>
<p>It’s been quite a while since their publication. So, you may notice some old stories during your reading. However, I think they are classic, and as any other book in this category, they aged very well.</p>

<p>Start receiving <strong>hand-picked content<br></strong><span>with high quality from <strong>experienced engineering leaders</strong> in your email regularly!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">Subscribe to our weekly Newsletter</a></p>

<p>That said, let’s go to the list.</p>
<h2>1. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</h2>
<p>The book was first published in 1987. The authors, Tom DeMarco and Timothy R. Lister talk about managing people through lots of stories. The stories may sound outdated and unlikely to happen nowadays, but their essence is still valid.</p>
<p>Many things stated by the two authors are kind of obvious, like<em> how expensive the turnover is, that we should include the team in the hiring process and that methodologies are restrictive</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic opportunity to recapitulate those topics; <strong>some were written more than 30 years ago</strong>.</p>
<p>Peopleware was the first book that I recall to mention the need for a sociological view, not only a technical one over projects and teams. As such, Tom and Timothy’s theories are still valid.</p>
<p>Among the theories, I how they state the importance of peer view (or <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">Code Review</a>, in our case), and that knowledge workers, like software engineers, are continuously working their soft and hard skills.</p>
<p>The theories go through the traps of <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/how-tech-leads-and-team-leads-can-measure-teams-productivity">software engineering productivity</a>, how office influences how we work, the impact of quality in our work, and much more.</p>
<h2>2. Driving technical change: Why People on Your Team Don’t Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should</h2>
<p>If you’re new on persuasion and influence, the Driving Technical Change book is an excellent start. It’s full of anecdotes that surface how to gain skeptics buy-in for your ideas. It was published in 2010 and written by Terrence Ryan.</p>
<p>The content works pretty well for <em>an introductory approach on how to expose your ideas, find allies, and, most importantly, check whether your proposals are plausible</em>.</p>
<p>The book also lists some <strong>categories of skepticism, which was very valuable to me</strong>. I could better understand how the team responded to my inclinations and how I responded to others. This awareness is an excellent start for those wanting to manage large teams.</p>
<p>I confess the book is not very practical, and that may be a disadvantage against it. However, it was very relevant when I read it for the first time, and I strongly suggest you read this short (~200 pages) book even though it won’t answer all your questions or tell you exactly what to do.</p>
<h2>3. The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</h2>
<p>If you thought Peopleware was old because it was published in the late 80s, well, my next recommendation is 15 years earlier.</p>
<p>The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks was<strong> first published in 1975 (almost 50 years ago!)</strong> and covers <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">software engineering and management topics</a>.</p>
<p>The author creates the concept of man-month. It’s the unit for the amount of work of a person in a month. Then, he defends that adding more people to a late project makes it later. It’s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brook’s law</a>.</p>
<p>It relates to the latest and hottest discussions in the agile world about “coordination costs”: <strong>when you increase the number of people in a group, organizing work gets harder</strong>. Thus, it requires more meetings and management efforts to align everybody, which delays the software development even more.</p>
<p>It’s an inspiring book, a classic one, which, in a certain way, is still modern and worth the reading.</p>

<p>I've seen some people arguing about how software development should be<br>
less "passion" and more science. Others argue about how similar<br>
software development and design is to a craft and how sterile it would<br>
be without consideration for aesthetics and elements of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to who says it it's easy to notice that both points of view<br>
come from different environments. One person working for a huge company may<br>
be thinking about the benefits of standards and automation and the benefits of formality.</p>
<p>Another person is talking from a different place and looking at software as a means of expression and focused on the creative characteristics of the medium. Starting from an idea and quickly move to crystallization, without formalities is what drives a lot of people to work on software.</p>
<p>Even if both perspectives seem distant, they share something in common.<br>
They both start from the experience of the people doing the work.</p>
<p>We can't ignore the fact that the experience of creating software is very different<br>
if it's for a big organization, for a small group, or as an open-source project<br>
separated from any deadline or commercial incentive.</p>
<p>A relevant quote from <a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/08/07/pedagogy-in-the-trade-changing-emphasis/">GeePaw Hill</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no valid formal method for making and shipping software. If there were, humans would not be programming, computers would. Software making is irremediably, permanently, thoroughly, and happily dependent on individual humans using judgment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't it interesting that even with the lack of structure, some of the core tools we use every day<br>
have emerged from Open Source and not from the big companies with the money to use formal, math-based methods of creating software?</p>
<p>It's true that the lack of structure and opportunity for self-expression in Open Source is not a good fit for some areas where formal methods are required, so here we should recognize that there's not a unique "software development" culture, and get used to having different cultures that naturally emerge to tackle different problems. We have a problem with obsolete titles like "backend/frontend developer" that do not reflect the reality of what people do nowdays.</p>
<p>I'm aware that this discussion comes from the desire to transform software development into a more predictable activity and the idea that removing human judgment from the equation should get us closer to that. Take for example ehe way NASA develops its space ship software. It's a very extreme process when just a line of code may need weeks of discussion and evaluation. It's an exceptional process because its usage and failure treshold has very specific constraints and consequences.  The culture that emerged from those probelms is very specific too and not easily transferable to other environments. Focusing on the set of code that runs inside a space ship is a very specific and exceptional use case but I'm sure there are millions of lines of code of the supporting tools, administrative and operational stuff that is still used by NASA employees and is not developed in the same way. Different problems with different failure and experimentation thresholds.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see more new cultures develop inside the "software development sphere". Some excentric methodologies may arise that are a good fit to create a certain family of tools or serve some economic interest.<br>
Again, Open Source is very interesting because of its lack of coordination and structure. It doesn't mind deadlines, and for lots of authors, it's not directly tied to commercial incentives.</p>
<p>We could keep going and expand these ideas but the key point is that "software development" will keep growing in different directions at the same time, producing different cultures that are defined more from the problems the authors are trying to solve. The title "software developer" is starting to look like an imprecise definition of what some people do and the new roles should take into account the "culture" defined by the ideas/problems/innovations the group or individual is working on  The opposite of a "unified theory of software development" is what's currently happening. This leaves us with more questions, like what can an information worker do to better adapt to this and what companies can do about it, how to define the new roles and why fluidity instead of fixed labels is key, but I'll leave those ideas for another time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After months of work, I am ecstatic to finally announce <strong>Bevy Engine</strong>!</p>
<p>Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust. It is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">free and open-source</a> forever!</p>
<p>It has the following design goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capable</b>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set</li>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users</li>
<li><b>Data Focused</b>: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm </li>
<li><b>Modular</b>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel</li>
<li><b>Productive</b>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bevy ECS</b>: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance</li>
<li><b>Render Graphs</b>: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes</li>
<li><b>Bevy UI</b>: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy</li>
<li><b>Productive Compile Times</b>: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the "fast compiles" config</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)</li>
<li><b>3D</b>: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading</li>
<li><b>Sprites</b>: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets</li>
<li><b>Assets</b>: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds</li>
<li><b>Plugins</b>: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems</li>
<li><b>Multiple Render Backends</b>: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu</a>)</li>
<li><b>Data Driven Shaders</b>: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms</li>
<li><b>Hot Asset Reloading</b>: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts</li>
<li><b>Events</b>: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems</li>
<li><b>Properties</b>: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names</li>
<li><b>Hierarchical Transforms</b>: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy </li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the "prototyping" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. <span>I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability</span>.</p>
<p>Hopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">The Bevy Book</a> is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note to the reader</strong>: in this article you will find text formatted like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_render/latest/bevy_render/texture/struct.Texture.html"><code>Texture</code>
</a></p>
<p>This formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!</p>
<h2 id="bevy-apps">Bevy Apps</h2>
<p>First, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_default_plugins</span><span>()
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc</p>
<p>You can also register the default <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> manually like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>CorePlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>InputPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>WindowPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>RenderPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>UiPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        </span><span>/* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */
        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> for simplicity, at least initially. </p>
<h2 id="bevy-ecs">Bevy ECS</h2>
<p>All Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component, whereas another entity might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>UI</code> component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a <code>movement</code> system that runs on all entities with a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.</p>
<p>Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b>: normal Rust structs</li>
<li><b>Systems</b>: normal Rust functions</li>
<li><b>Entities</b>: a type containing a unique integer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rW7ALyHaas">great introductions</a> to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave "getting up to speed on ECS" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>I'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS <em>in existence</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>struct </span><span>Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);
</span><span>struct </span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);

</span><span>// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components
</span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands</span><span>) {</span><span>
    commands
        </span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),))
        .</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>2.0</span><span>),));
}

</span><span>// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component
</span><span>fn </span><span>movement</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Position</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>velocity</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>) {</span><span>
    position</span><span>.</span><span>0 </span><span>+=</span><span> velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;
}

</span><span>// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_startup_system</span><span>(</span><span>setup</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>movement</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs">won't</a> find <a href="https://github.com/TomGillen/legion">any</a> ECS <a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/blob/master/bunny_demo/src/systems.rs">with</a> better <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube">clarity</a> or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write <em>and</em> easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>One of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic <em>super</em> fast, primarily for these two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Iteration Speed</b>: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast</li>
<li><b>Parallelism</b>: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>Bevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular <code>ecs_bench</code> benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:</p>
<h4 id="system-iteration-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">System Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_iter.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<h4 id="world-setup-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">World Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_build.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<p>Note that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. </p>
<p>I have pushed my version of <code>ecs_bench</code> <a href="https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench">here</a> if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking "Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but <em>surely</em> this means you had to compromise on features!"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today we’re announcing that <a href="http://parabola.io/">Parabola</a> has raised an $8m Series A led by Matrix Partners, bringing our total raised to just over $10m. Ilya Sukhar from Matrix is joining our board, and we're grateful for participation from Thrive Capital, Elad Gil, AngelPad, Merus Capital, Abstract Ventures, and individual investors.</p><p>We’re also announcing our Shopify integration and focus on helping ecommerce companies (including companies that are newly doing business online) navigate unprecedented times. But before we talk about what that means, let’s start with how we got here.</p><h3>Unequal access to technology</h3><blockquote>“The future is already here, it just isn’t evenly distributed yet.” — William Gibson</blockquote><p>I've always had a productive and positive relationship with technology. Due in large part to luck and circumstance, I learned how to code when I was young and was able to express my creativity through customizing and creating things in the digital world. But most of my friends, relatives, and peers didn’t have the same experience.</p><p>Today, there are two very different kinds of computer users: those who manually operate a computer via much drudgery and those who program computers to do work for them. Most of the benefits have accrued to those who can program a computer.</p><p>We were promised that the Digital Revolution would free us from this manual drudgery so we could unleash our innate creativity and curiosity. However, instead of being empowered, for many the forward march of technology has been a loss of agency. But all hope is not lost — we just need to more evenly distribute the future.</p><h3>Repetitive, manual work</h3><p>Through a journey that took me out of the world of engineering and into the worlds of both finance and ecommerce, I discovered entire industries built around analytical and creative people stuck doing repetitive, manual work in spreadsheets.</p><p>From the marketing analyst compiling yesterday's attribution metrics to the operations team manually refunding returned orders, manual processes were holding these businesses together.</p><p>It wasn’t that they didn’t want new technology. The real problem was that new technology wasn’t being built for the way they work.</p><h3>Parabola</h3><p>It turns out I was far from the only person who cared about this problem. I'm privileged to be joined by a phenomenal team of likeminded people who are similarly driven to help more evenly distribute the future.</p><p>At Parabola, we come to work every day armed with the belief that everyone has the ability to be amazingly analytical, curious, and creative. Unfortunately (even tragically), most people have never been given the tools and encouragement to unleash their ingenuity.</p><p>But what if they were? Every great marketer could try their idea without waiting for engineering resources. Every operations person could solve a problem once and then automate it for the future. Everyone with an interesting insight could build something to test it. In short, the world would have a lot less mundane work and a lot more cool stuff.</p><p>We're building a drag-and-drop productivity tool that lets everyone translate what they want to do into instructions for a computer to do it for them. With a library of customizable, prebuilt steps, you can use Parabola to automate your previously repetitive, manual data tasks with an easy, step-by-step approach. We also have a library of ready-to-use recipes imbued with the subject matter expertise of industry experts to make it even easier to get started and know you're doing things the right way.</p><figure id="w-node-6ab50f968817-9c9ca267"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d9bdcad630fbe7a7468a9d8/5f326dd74ee81a7834df3635_step-by-step.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>We’re just getting started</h3><p>With tens of thousands of users across many thousands of companies, we’ve seen people build incredible things with Parabola. We treasure every story we hear of users building flows in Parabola to take over their manual tasks, freeing up time for more strategic/creative work and achieving huge career growth in the process.</p><p>With the new money, we’re particularly focused on making Parabola easier to use without compromising on its power. With our new Shopify integration, we’re increasingly delivering on that promise for our ecommerce users who are scrambling to shift offline processes online and rapidly scale their operations to meet demand in a time of COVID. But we believe all knowledge workers can benefit immensely from the version of Parabola we’re building towards.</p><p>If you’re excited about this being the last day you do that same manual process in Excel, then welcome to the future. Our support team is ready to help you get set up today at <a href="http://parabola.io/">parabola.io</a>.</p><p>If you’re excited about helping us deliver this ambitious mission, we’ll need a lot more help so we’d love to hear from you. We’re currently hiring across a variety of roles for people with extreme product passion who are looking for a place they can be rewarded for doing the best work they’ve ever done.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <div>
        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>This post lays out an overview of the guiding principles driving much of the
work behind the main parts of the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan Project</a>. For
those unaware, Arcan is presented as something as uncommon as a ‘desktop
engine’. The grand claim is that modifying and understanding the entirety of
your desktop should be ‘patching scripts’ level easy if we rework current
popular abstractions and adjust the division of labour.</p>

<p>The principles themselves link together to tell a large chunk of the vision of
the ‘divergent desktop’; a story that has been slowly getting its shape over
many years, greatly influenced by a number of publicly documented experiments
as well as seminal works such as Von Neumann’s “The Computer and the Brain”,
Norbert Weiner’s “The Human use of Human Beings”, Ian Hacking on “Representing
and Intervening”, Jaron Lanier’s trilogy on what the future may hold in store,
as well as the nowadays less digestible amalgamation of +Fravia’s Search Lores.</p>

<p>The overview is quite a long read in its own right, and full versions of each
principle will be added as individual articles over time – If the contents in
the sections here comes off as a bit dense and hard to ingest, fret not! They
are more teasers or appetisers, the full course meal will have better pacing
and technical depth.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience, here are navigational links to the individual
sections:</p>

  <li><a href="#p12">Simplicity Is Systemic</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="backstory-and-motivation">Backstory and Motivation</h2>

<p>The Arcan project, at its core, is rooted in assumption that the ‘desktop’ way
of interfacing with computing is inching towards its last of breaths, and
rewriting X11 or JSONifying STDOUT won’t provide much more air than for a final
gasp.</p>

<p>The upside is that this may well turn out to be something positive that
provides opportunity for radical simplification and restructuring of the myriad
of technologies that make out the Rube Goldbergian contraption that is the ‘modern’
desktop.</p>

<p>The first non-academic presentation (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=07nqZIFRDJg">video</a>)
on the Arcan project had a terse, technical-overview style to it, with very little
in terms of motivation or actual intended direction.</p>

<p>The reason for that was that I wanted to keep the attention and focus on “what it is”
rather than “what will it ever be used for”, and carefully note who tries to fill
in the cryptic blank spaces, and with what. This was predicated on the belief
that honest dissemination is done by first demonstrating the feasibility and
soundness of the fundamentals of the tech in isolation; flowery visions,
soap-boxing and sociopolitical annotation are best left deferred to separate
stages should the underlying tech be sufficiently coherent and robust.</p>

<p>It is not, however, some vacuous perspective of the technology as living a life
disjunct from the social consequences of its application, but having that as
the goto default mental model for any fledgling utterances is as much of a
fool’s errand as thinking that it should never be viewed through the optics of
an abstract larger social organism.</p>

<p>The basic motivation for <em>all</em> of this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am of humble needs and wants: I want to expand my agency, security, safety and quality of experience in regards to all things that computing touch. The largest obstacle to that expansion, right now, is the chaos and complexity of user-space, the dependency creep towards an online ‘service-space’, the peering eyes this ‘service space’ uses to study and repackage some naive interpretation of ‘you’, and how this service space is being used to mutate social- and critical- infrastructure towards something wholly frightening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a personal level, I have coded and experimented with virtually everything
computing since the days of the venerable C-64 (divide it by two, flip it over,
that’s 23) – viruses, anti-viruses; drm protections, cracks; database
engines; operating system kernels; cheats, bots and anti-cheats; emulators
(both interpreter dance and JITterbug); demos; games; parsers for more
formats than I can remember; exploits as well as mitigations. I have worked in
academia, government, military-industrial, fortune-500 as well as fledgling
startups, and got the scars and theses to prove it. The ‘left to observe’ list
has grown rather short over the years.</p>

<p>During this time, the evolution of the capabilities of the devices themselves
have exceeded all expectactions and is nothing short of spectacular. The
hardware and software lockout which plagued the early days is, relatively
speaking, minor; access to both capable devices and deep technical information
has become absolutely stellar, overwhelmingly so. The days of begging companies
for scraps of hardware; scraping public libraries and dumpsters for slices of
information; for quid-pro-quo trading of hacker ‘secrets’ and basic software
building blocks (‘warez’) are mostly faint memories. Hopefully they will remain
as such in spite of troubling signs up ahead.</p>

<p>The counterweight to this positive development is that things have become complex
to the degree that a thorough and deep understanding, <em>preconditions</em> to responsible
control and agency, is a hard thing to come by, and an even harder thing to fight
for. Just add more dependencies and layers! Get it to market! Cash out! Build a
community! Become its figurehead! Sell the community! Pass the plate! Don’t forget
to Like Comment and Subscribe! Oh and this message was sponsored by yet another
pointless VPN from a provider you can’t trust but somehow protects you from a
network you don’t trust. With such words the once so tiny tech snowball continues
its merry way down the mountain towards the village.</p>

<p>No matter the outcome, I have more things on the immediate ‘todo’ in terms of
creative things alone – than I have hours left to live, regardless of how many
those turn out to be. That is a pleasant mental image to fall back on in times of
gloom and doom.</p>

<p>My dedication to this project and the tens of thousands of invested hours has
been described as both ‘a labour of love’ as well as the more colloquial
‘fucking insane’, though personally, I view it as an act of necessity.</p>

<p>Many a times the journey has felt like digging out of a prison using the
collarbone of a fallen mate as a makeshift shovel, fuelled by the vapours of
some faint hope that there is a relatively more free world waiting within
reach, and that the proverbial roses I can smell are not just a hallucinogenic
side effect from some invisible gas deposit that this old canary has stumbled
upon.</p>

<p>The motivation is not all some evolutionary struggle for freedom. The rest
comes from bitter anger, even resentment, towards the dominant status quo and
the trajectory that computing interfaces as a whole is moving along; pandering
to trivial attention grabbing nonsense (‘engagement’) rather than crafting
sharper tools that can claw at the delicious problems that the future holds in
store.</p>

<h2 id="principle-1-professionals-first">Principle 1: Professionals First</h2>


<p>The traditional desktop is a compromise of interests, with the more recent bias
being towards appealing to a supposed ‘mainstream’ audience. This made sense
from an economical growth standpoint within the kinetics of the peculiar brand
of capitalism at the time; the previous demographic was already hooked on the
computing drug - being ‘users’ after all.</p>

<p>The thing nowadays is that the load-bearing mainstream audience is opting out at
a rapid rate and for good reason; smartphones, tablets, digital ‘assistants’,
gaming consoles and so on are all chopping up the generic ‘desktop’ into more
controlled corporate thiefdoms.</p>

<p>Many of the past compromises that were made in order to accomodate this wider
and less experienced audience are also unnecessarily restricting agency,
precision and and efficiency for those (‘the professional’) who possess both a
stronger mental model of computing, and a vested interest in its advancement.</p>

<p>It makes little sense to try and convince your grandmother that she needs a
Free! Open-Source! desktop, and it is a farce, bordering on self-harm, to still
use that scenario as part of some requirement specification for the future.</p>

<p>That aside, the ‘professional’ here is not meant as a vain appeal to exclusionary
hacker elitism – before the numbers of those within such lines dip towards that
of past ‘biker freedom’ seekers such as radio ‘amateurs’, circuit benders and
BBS operators. The ‘professional’ is acknowledging that there is a large number
(millions) of key individuals in a wide gamut of professions that are currenty
wasting much of their time and talents thanks to misguided attempts at software
ergonomics that will try and make due with what the web can give them, but they
should not have to.</p>

<p><em>Revisit past workflows, put the professional first.</em></p>


<h2 id="principle-2-diversify-experience">Principle 2: Diversify Experience</h2>

<p>A long standing maxim in computing is that of ‘mechanism, not policy’. From
a user experience perspective, it is rooted in the assumption that the user
is both willing- and capable- of leveraging mechanisms and configure them into
their own sets of policies. This has largely failed in the ‘desktop’ sense,
and very much stagnated in the command-line processing one.</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons for this, and one likely culprit on a high
level is the marketing gospel of ‘it just works’. This is a rhetoric which
strongly favours a ‘brand identity’ preset of strict policies and aesthetics
at the desktop level and beyond. Its implementation allows for little to no
accessible layering in between the opaqueness of a UI element such as a
‘button’ and the set of actions the idea of it ‘working’ represents.</p>

<p>This turns into a problem when your personal expectations of what ‘just works’
happens to clash with those of …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="resource"><h2>10 best practices to secure Kubernetes</h2><p>‍</p><p>Over the last couple of years, Kubernetes has become all the rage and it is now the most popular container orchestration and scheduling clustered system.&nbsp; In this article, we will cover the top 10 things you should look out for when pushing Kubernetes configurations from development through your deployment process. Our recommendations come from real-world experience with Kubernetes configurations that made it to production but should never have.</p><p>‍</p><h2>1. Warning: If a service load balancer is enabled</h2><p>‍</p><p>In a service definition if you make it a “type: LoadBalancer,” then the cloud you are on will create a load balancer for you.&nbsp; In AWS this is an ELB (external by default) and in GCP this is a LoadBalancer (external). &nbsp;All too often though, it’s a security risk since you are exposing something onto the internet with few to no security controls. There is at least one external load balancer that handles the services you want to expose to the Internet and everything routes into that.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When getting PR with this type should be flagged and reviewed.</p><p>kind: Service
<br>
apiVersion: v1
<br>
metadata:
<br>
	name: my-service
<br>
spec:
<br>
  selector:
    <br>
    app: MyApp
  <br>
  ports:
  <br>
  - protocol: TCP
    <br>
    port: 80
    <br>
    targetPort: 9376
    <br>
  clusterIP: 10.0.171.239
  <br>
  loadBalancerIP: 78.11.24.19
  <br>
  type: LoadBalancer</p><p>Anytime the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer">“type: LoadBalancer”</a> line changes, it should be flagged and&nbsp;someone - a DevOps Engineer perhaps - should review for verification and approval.</p><h2>2. Warning: If a service exposes a NodePort</h2><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-nodeport-vs-loadbalancer-vs-ingress-when-should-i-use-what-922f010849e0">“Service: NodePort”</a>, will open a port on all of the nodes where it can be reached by the network external to the cluster. This exposes the cluster to a security risk. Caution should be taken when making this decision. Just like type LoadBalancer, it is really easy to do because many tutorials direct you to do it for ease of use reasons.&nbsp; Even a lot of helm / stable charts do this by default to make it “easy” for you to reach the application.<br></p><p>apiVersion: v1
<br>
kind: Service
<br>
metadata:
<br>
  name: [my-nodeport-service]
  <br>
  labels:
  <br>
    [my-label-key]: [my-label-value]
    <br>
spec:
<br>
  selector:
  <br>
    [my-selector-key]: [my-selector-value]
    <br>
  type: NodePort // This sets the “type”
  <br>
  ports:
  <br>
   - port: 8081
   <br>
     nodePort: 31514</p><p>‍</p><h2>3. Enable the ‘readiness probe’ on a deployment</h2><p>‍</p><p>A “readiness” probe should&nbsp; be defined in any deployment. This is simply a signal to inform Kubernetes when to put this pod behind the load balancer and when to put this service behind the proxy to serve traffic.&nbsp; If you put an application behind the load balancer before it is ready, then a user can reach this pod but will not get the expected response of a healthy server. &nbsp;This rule is here to give an alert to the pod developer that <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-readiness-probes">the readiness probe</a> should be enabled.</p><p>‍</p><h2>4. Enable ‘liveness probe’ on a deployment</h2><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-a-liveness-http-request">The liveness probe</a> is just as important as the readiness probe.&nbsp; The liveness probe lets Kubernetes know if the pod is in a healthy state and if it isn’t healthy, Kubernetes should restart it.&nbsp; This is done via a simple check, such as getting an HTTP 200ok on some endpoint or a more complex check based on some bash commands. &nbsp;Either way, it is important - and very handy - to let Kubernetes know when the application isn’t working and needs to be restarted.<br></p><div><p>
livenessProbe:
			<br>
      httpGet:
      <br>
        path: /healthz
        <br>
        port: 8080
        <br>
      initialDelaySeconds: 3
      <br>
      periodSeconds: 3
      <br></p></div><p>‍<br></p><h2>5. Enable CPU/Mem requests and limits not set on a deployment</h2><p>‍</p><p>The container(s) in a deployment should automatically requests the CPU and memory resources that it needs and define it for the system. This prevents the pod from being starved of resources, and also prevents CPU/Mem from consuming all of the resources on a node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>resources:
<br>
      requests:
      <br>
        memory: "64Mi"
        <br>
        cpu: "250m"
        <br>
      limits:
      <br>
        memory: "128Mi"
        <br>
        cpu: "500m"</p><p>‍</p><h2>6. Control the container images deployed into your cluster</h2><p>‍</p><p>Your company may be more or less stringent on where the binaries come from, depending on their policy on third-party binaries. If you are pulling common images that organizations use - like the official nginx, MySQL, or Redis - your organization might want to build it from source and/or rehost the image internally instead of pulling from Docker Hub. </p><p>The reason is that the images stored in Docker Hub can change if someone pushes the same image and tag to it.&nbsp; That means what you get from pulling the same image and tag may be different from one day to another, causing confusion. Additionally, the difference could be something malicious that could compromise your infrastructure and application. To mitigate these risks, you can either build the image from the source and host it in your own repository, or push the same images into your repository.&nbsp;</p><p>If your organization hosts some or all of your container images, you should apply this rule to flag any image not coming from your organization and flag it for someone to approve.</p><p>apiVersion: v1
<br>
kind: Pod
<br>
metadata:
<br>
  labels:
  <br>
    test: liveness
    <br>
  name: liveness-http
  <br>
spec:
<br>
  containers:
  <br>
  - name: liveness
  <br>
    image: some-random-image-i-found-on-the-internet:v1.0</p><p>‍</p><h2>7. Apply Network Policy to your Deployments</h2><p>‍</p><p>Applying Security Groups policies to your VMs or your Kubernetes worker nodes are considered essential to security. We should do the same with Kubernetes workloads.</p><p>The best practice is to limit inbound and outbound traffic to only what you need so you don’t accidentally expose unwanted services on the outbound.&nbsp; Kubernetes has Network Policy functionality that's equivalent to Security Groups. All resources should have <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#the-networkpolicy-resource">Network Policy rules</a> associated with their deployments.<br></p><p>For every deployment set, there should be a network policy file or the following resource:<br></p><p>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
<br>
kind: NetworkPolicy</p><p>If you want to get super fancy with it, you can match up the ports list to those outlined in the deployments pods exposed list and/or the service port list.<br></p><p>ports:
<br>
   - protocol: TCP
   <br>
     port: 6379
     <br></p><p>Ideally, these would all match so that the developers know that everything reconciles and the network policy doesn't list a port that is not used by the service or pod.<br></p><p>Also make sure that you provisioned your cluster with network plugin (CNI) that supports network policies.</p><h2>8. Flag any service account changes&nbsp;</h2><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/">Service accounts</a> provide an identity mapped to some set of Kubernetes API server access permissions for a pod to use.&nbsp; When these items change, it should be flagged for review. &nbsp;These might be very minor changes that are easily overlooked, but have big ramifications on security and API server&nbsp;access. &nbsp;When these items are changed, the right persons should be notified to review the changes before it is allowed to merge.<br></p><p>If you see this type of change, flag it:<br></p><p>apiVersion: v1
<br>
kind: ServiceAccount
<br></p><p>If a service account name changes, flag it:<br></p><p>apiVersion: v1 
<br>
 kind: Pod | Deployment | Daemonset | Statefulset | rs | rc 
 <br>
 metadata:  
 <br>
  name: my-pod 
  <br>
 spec:  
 <br>
  serviceAccountName: build-robot</p><h2>9. Flag When RBAC rules change</h2><p>‍</p><p>The principle of least privilege is something your security team will be bugging you about. It's a compelling reason to get your RBAC configuration right. This is something that requires an overall review, starting with subjects that can create resources like Deployments or Pods in general or read sensitive resources like Secrets.<br></p><p>The challenging part, is to understand when Role (or ClusterRole) resources does not add privileges over time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Such change is definitely something that should be flagged for a review.<br></p><p>For example: Changing verbs: ["get"]&nbsp; to verbs: [“*”] is a significant change.<br></p><p>Check out these <a href="https://github.com/uruddarraju/kubernetes-rbac-policies/blob/master/README.md">sample RBAC policies</a> to get started.</p><h2>10. Flag when Pod ‘toleration’ to run on the master nodes is added</h2><p>‍</p><p>The Kubernetes master nodes are the control nodes of the entire cluster.&nbsp; Therefore, only certain items should be permitted to run on these nodes. To effectively limit what can run on these nodes, taints are placed on the nodes to specify items that <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/">tolerate&nbsp;the taint</a> can run on them. However, this does not preclude anyone from using these taints on their pods to run on the master nodes.<br></p><p>If you encounter the toleration below on a Pod specification in one of your deployment resources, and your cluster is self-managed, it should be flagged for review:<br></p><p>node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>The above 10 best practices should always be implemented before running deployments in order to mitigate security risks and ensure operational excellence. There are tools that could help you do that effectively, including <a href="https://www.alcide.io/">Alcide</a> and Datree. </p><p>Alcide's <a href="https://www.alcide.io/kubernetes-advisor">Kubernetes Advisor</a> audits your Kubernetes cluster, nodes and pods configuration to make sure that the cluster is tuned and runs according to security best practices. </p><p>Datree allows you to check Kubernetes configuration files early on during development - when code is committed to source control - to ensure these practices and your other development standards are adopted.</p><p>‍<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/rmpr/atbswp">atbswp</a>: Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (yes like the book) is a multi platform, open source clone of tinytask, and for those who don’t know it, 
the core feature of the software is to allow the users to record their mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce them identically as many times as they want.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0jjSgX5FYk"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/L0jjSgX5FYk/0.jpg" alt="atbswp quick demo"></a></p>


<p>The rest of this post discusses what atbswp is, why it was built, and miscellaneous things related to the project.</p>


<p>atbswp is the result of frustration with tinytask which is not available natively on Unix like systems. With tinytask being discontinued now, the position shifted from multiplatform, 
FOSS clone, to only alternative. The most important thing about atbswp is avoiding feature creep, the software is pretty simple as it and we want to keep it that way.</p>


<p>Many features of tinytask are already present in the current pre-alpha version of atbswp, the one that have not been yet replicated are compile to an executable for the host platform 
and set a replay speed, which are on the roadmap and will be the main focus for the next development. Behind the scenes, atbswp uses a Python file so the power users can always modify
it to their taste.</p>


<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui">pyautogui</a> : Used for the replay feature</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput">pynput</a>: to record user input</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller">PyInstaller</a>: to bundles the application into a single package</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">poetry</a>: to publish on PyPI</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/">wxPython</a>: for the GUI</li>
</ul>


<p>atbswp is pretty usable as it is. Although this is a pre-alpha release, it’s stable enough to be used daily, I use it to automate various task and almost all of my demos.</p>

<p>If you want up to date news about atbswp, <a href="https://hostux.social/@rmpr">follow me on Mastodon</a> to be notified about releases and blog posts like this, or you can join the 
community on <a href="https://t.me/atbswp">Telegram</a>, atbswp’s <a href="https://github.com/rmpr/atbswp">source code</a> is available on Github, you can try it now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><picture id="hero-thumbnail">
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/blog/central%20manage.webp" type="image/webp"></picture><p><h2>Published on Jul 31, 2020</h2></p></section><p>Let’s discuss an extremely common anti-pattern I’ve noticed with teams that are
relatively new to containers/cloud-native/kubernetes, etc. More so than when
building traditional monoliths, cloud-native applications can be incredibly
complex and, as a result, need a relatively sophisticated development
environment. Unfortunately, this need often isn’t evident at the beginning of
the cloud-native journey. Development environments are an afterthought – a
cumbersome, heavy, brittle drag on productivity.</p><p>The best teams treat development environments as a priority and devote
significant time to perfecting them. In doing so, they end up with
development environments that “just work” for every developer, not just those
who are experienced with containers and Kubernetes. For these teams, every
developer has a fast, easy-to-use development environment that works for every
developer every time.</p><h2 id="whats-a-development-environment">What’s a development environment?</h2><p>Before we go further, let’s get on the same page about what we mean by a
development environment in this context. When working with cloud-native
applications, each service depends on numerous containers, serverless
functions, and cloud services to operate. For this post, a development
environment is a sandbox in which developers can run their code and
dependencies for testing. It’s not the IDE, compiler, debugger, or any of those
other tools.</p><h2 id="sound-familiar">Sound Familiar?</h2><p>You’re working on a new project or planning to modernize an old one. The team
has read all about the whiz-bang nifty new cloud-native technologies, like
containers, Kubernetes, etc. So, you decide to take the plunge and build a
cloud-native app.</p><p>The team realizes that a core group of SREs will be necessary to get
everything running in a scalable, reliable, and automated setup. DevOps
engineers are hired/trained and get to work. They setup up Kubernetes, CI/CD,
monitoring, logging, and all of the other tools we’ve learned are critical for
a modern application.</p><p>Everyone knows that it’s the SRE team’s job to get all of this stuff up and
running. However, development environments aren’t top of mind. The SRE team
considers it their duty to focus on production and CI/CD – Development is the
developer’s job. At the same time, the developers think it’s their job to
deliver application features, not to maintain infrastructure. It’s not really
anyone’s responsibility to focus on developer experience before CI/CD, so it’s
neglected.</p><div><div><h2 id="why-cloud-native-kills-developer-productivityhttpskeldaiowhitepaper"><a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Why Cloud Native kills developer productivity</a></h2><p>Making the switch to microservices but think it’s too good to be true? Or you already made the switch but you’re starting to notice that local development is harder than it used to be. You’re not alone. <a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Read more of this whitepaper</a></p></div><picture>
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.webp" type="image/webp"><img data-src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png" alt="img" src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png"></picture></div><p>Unfortunately, an ad hoc approach to development environments tends to emerge.
Whenever there’s a new service, whatever developer happens to be working on it,
realizes they need some way to boot their dependencies and test their code.
They Google around and figure that Docker Compose is a reasonable way to do
this. They copy and paste some example, tweak through trial and error until
it’s working, and move on. The quality fo this initial compose file ranges
widely depending on the DevOps knowledge of the engineer who happened to write
it. Sometimes it’s pretty solid; sometimes, it’s brittle and slow.</p><p>Worse, this process repeats. Every time there’s a new service, it gets a new
git repository, and some new engineer finds themselves writing a compose file.
Perhaps this new file is copied from an existing project. Perhaps it’s
developed from scratch. Either way, now we have two compose files that need to
be maintained and updated as the app changes over time. This process repeats
and repeats until all services have their own ever so slightly different
configuration files that are a nightmare to maintain.</p><p>As a result of this (all too common) process. We see several typical issues:</p><ul><li>Development environments are unmanageable. They spread across dozens of repositories in dozens of subtly different copy-and-pasted docker-compose files. Keeping these up to date in a fast-changing application is impossible.</li><li>Development environments are incomplete. They only deal with containers because they are the easiest for an individual developer to get up and running with docker-compose. Everything else developers need to test (serverless functions, databases, specialty cloud services) requires manual effort.</li><li>Developers waste time focusing on things that aren’t their specialization. Just as most backend engineers can’t CSS their way out of a paper bag, there’s no reason for every frontend/AI/data engineer to be experts on the current DevOps trends. Developers shouldn’t spend time configuring and debugging development environments — they should spend time building features.</li></ul><h2 id="managed-development-environments">Managed Development Environments</h2><p>So how do we avoid this all-too-common scenario? The good news is that it’s not particularly challenging to do so if you’re intentional and proactive. The best teams tend to follow a couple of principles to ensure a great experience.</p><p><strong>Clear Responsibility</strong>:</p><p>There’s a team that is explicitly responsible for providing development
environments for all developers. That team can be the SRE team, or a
dedicated developer productivity team. The key is that it’s someone’s job to
focus on this issue. Furthermore, that person is likely someone with a large
amount of DevOps expertise that will produce better outcomes more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Central Management</strong>:</p><p>The development environment must be managed centrally by the team responsible for it. A single git repository contains all of the configuration and scripts necessary for a developer to get going. When the DevEnv team changes something, they do so once in that central repository, and all developers benefit. Furthermore, typically, the development environments run in a centrally managed cluster in the cloud. As a result, it’s easy for the DevEnv team to ensure things work consistently for everyone, and debug problems when they do arise.</p><p><strong>Full Automation</strong>:</p><p>Their development environments are fully automated. A single command brings up everything a developer needs to test their code. Developers don’t need to do nearly any manual setup work beyond the code changes they’re actively working on.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Achieving these goals isn’t easy. It requires a significant and sustained investment from the DevEnv team, and buy-in from developers and management to succeed. However, while the cost can be significant, it’s small relative to the wasted time and effort saved by giving every developer a fast environment that just works every time. At <a href="https://kelda.io/">Kelda</a>, we’re working hard to make this dream attainable for every developer.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blimp/docs/sign-up-try-blimp/">Try Blimp</a> to see how you can improve development speed</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/how-docker-stores-registry-credentials/">Read more about Docker internals</a> – see how registry credentials are stored.</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/docker-volumes-for-development/">Tutorial: How to Use Docker Volumes to Code Faster</a></p><hr><p>By: Ethan Jackson</p></div></div>]]>

August 11, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days GDB is the go-to development/debugging tool of many embedded Rust developers.
We think there's room for complementary tools that could provide a better development workflow and improve productivity.
In this blog post we'll share our vision for great embedded Rust tooling and share info about the tools we have been building.</p>

<p>This is an early preview of our tool <code>binfmt</code>, which is the first tool included in our <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/knurling-rs/">knurling</a> project. It is available for preview and usage today for <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">sponsors</a> of the knurling-rs efforts, and will be made public in the future, when we feel the tool is ready for general availabilty (think "0.7" release or so).</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying out an early version of <code>binfmt</code>, you can become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">Knurling-rs sponsor</a> today!</p>



<p>GDB main features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breakpoints: halting execution once a certain part of the program is reached</li>
  <li>inspecting variables</li>
  <li>inspecting memory</li>
  <li>inspecting registers</li>
  <li>printing stack backtraces, which are function call stacks but in reverse.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are great <em>post-mortem</em> features meant for debugging issues like stack overflows, hardware fault exceptions (e.g. invalid instruction), memory corruption and ABI mismatch in function calls.</p>

<p>If you are writing an application in pure safe Rust, however, it's very unlikely you'll encounter these issues except perhaps for checked stack overflows.
During development your debugging questions will be more along the lines of: how has this register changed in response to that event? which steps brought the state machine to this particular state?
GDB features do not directly answer these questions but well placed <em>logs statements</em> do.</p>



<p>GDB operates under a "stop the world" model: run until a breakpoint, inspect things, move to the next breakpoint.
This model is not a great fit for embedded applications, which usually are reactive (need to respond to external events) and time sensitive in nature.
It is particularly problematic in applications that involve communication with other machines like USB, Ethernet and radio protocols (BLE, 802.15.4, etc.).
Halting the device often results in a breakdown of the communication which leaves no room for 'continuing the program'.</p>

<p>For these long live evented applications logging is more appropriate.
With logging you are not constrained to snapshots; instead you get the full story of your program.
Logging can quickly answer questions about the control flow of your program.
Not to mention that you can also print registers and data structures in a custom format.</p>

<p>So we think a first additional tool in the embedded toolbox is logging.</p>

<h2 id="logging-is-expensive">"Logging is expensive!"</h2>

<p>"Formatting is CPU expensive and storing strings in the device can use significant amounts of Flash" is probably what you are thinking.
I agree that <code>core::fmt</code> and anything that uses it, like the <code>log</code> crate, is not a great fit for resource constrained devices.
I have built programs with <code>log</code> and formatting indeed takes significant resources.
Let's look at the program size breakdown of the "Hello, world" program we used in <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our latest embedded Rust workshop</a>.</p>

<p>First, this is what the program prints to the host console:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>DEBUG:dk -- Initializing the board
DEBUG:dk -- Clocks configured
DEBUG:dk -- RTC started
DEBUG:dk -- I/O pins have been configured for digital output
DEBUG:dk -- Radio initialized and configured
INFO:hello -- Hello, world!
(..)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the breakdown of the <code>.text</code> section by function:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The <code>.text</code> section contains all the functions in the program</p>
</blockquote>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n10</span> <span>--bin</span> hello
<span>File  .text   Size      Crate Name
</span><span>0.8%  13.4% 1.3KiB        std &lt;char as core::fmt::Debug&gt;</span>::fmt
<span>0.6%  10.0%   964B      hello hello::__cortex_m_rt_main
0.5%   7.9%   768B        std core::str::slice_error_fail
0.5%   7.9%   766B        std core::fmt::Formatter::pad
0.4%   6.3%   610B        std core::fmt::Formatter::pad_integral
0.4%   6.2%   604B        std core::fmt::num::&lt;...
0.3%   4.8%   466B        std core::fmt::write
0.2%   3.9%   382B        std &lt;core::fmt::builders::PadAdapter as ...
0.2%   3.1%   302B        std core::slice::memchr::memchr
0.2%   2.6%   252B        std core::fmt::num::imp::&lt; ...
(..)
6.1% 100.0% 9.5KiB            .text section size
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Formatting functions are among the largest functions in the program according to <code>cargo-bloat</code> and formatting functions in the top 10 take more than 45% of <code>.text</code> (~4.5 KB).
In contrast, the <code>main</code> function (the application logic) is 10% of the total program size.
Having logging take ~50% of your program sounds not promising at all even if you are only including logs in development builds.</p>

<p><code>cargo-bloat</code> only reports the size of <code>.text</code>.
Strings are stored in <code>.rodata</code> so let's see how much space logging strings are taking using <code>cargo-size</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> hello <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>
<span>hello  :
section              size        addr
(..)
.text                9680       0x100
.rodata              4540      0x26d0
(..)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>.rodata</code> is 4.5 KB, about half the size of <code>.text</code>.
Also not great.</p>

<h2 id="making-logging-very-cheap">Making logging very cheap</h2>

<p>The first step towards making logging pervasive in embedded code is to make it cheap.
To this end we have been working on a logging framework called <code>binfmt</code>:</p>



<p>Below is the <code>cargo-bloat</code> output of a minimal <code>async</code> USB application that exposes a fully working HID interface and uses <code>binfmt</code> for logging (program output shown in the video above).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n20</span> <span>--bin</span> hid
<span>File  .text   Size     Crate Name
2.9%  56.0% 4.6KiB       hal USBD
0.3%   6.6%   548B [Unknown] main
0.3%   5.3%   440B       hal POWER
0.1%   2.6%   216B       hal RTC0
0.1%   2.4%   200B       hal hal::usbd::start_epin2
0.1%   2.1%   176B       hal hal::usbd::start_epin0
0.1%   1.9%   160B       hal hal::usbd::EVENTCAUSE
(..)
0.0%   0.7%    58B       hal binfmt::binWrite::write_sym
0.0%   0.7%    56B       hal binfmt::binWrite::leb128_write
0.0%   0.6%    52B       hal semidap::log
5.2% 100.0% 8.2KiB           .text section size
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In contrast to the <code>hello</code> example, which uses the <code>log</code> crate, now logging functions are at the bottom of the top 20 largest functions reported by <code>cargo-bloat</code>.</p>

<p>And if we look at the <code>.rodata</code> section we now see that it's minimal.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> hid
<span>hid  :
(..)
section              size        addr
.rodata                 4  0x20003250
.text                8364  0x20003254
(..)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What's more the program size (<code>.text + .rodata</code>) of <code>hid</code> (8 KB) is ~60% of <code>hello</code> (14 KB) and packs way more functionality (USB &amp; an async executor).</p>

<p>As for the difference in runtime work we clocked <code>binfmt::info!("x={}", 42)</code> to be in the order of a few microseconds whereas <code>log::info!()</code> took ~60 microseconds or so.
I must admit this comparison is sort-of apples to oranges because it's possible to construct (absurd) edge cases that make the ratio 100:1 or higher.</p>



<p>We also think it's important to erase the gap between <code>std</code> and <code>no_std</code> applications.
<code>no_std</code> applications usually are executed using third-party subcommands; this makes them feel not first-class.
Ideally, <code>cargo run</code> should Just Work with <code>no_std</code> applications.
That's why we have created a <em>custom Cargo runner</em> that lets you run <code>cargo-run</code> embedded applications.</p>

<p>With this custom Cargo runner you can, for example, use the standard <code>todo!</code> as a placeholder for code that you have not yet written.
Take for instance this piece of <code>no_std</code> USB code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>handle_standard_request</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>:</span> <span>usb</span><span>::</span><span>StandardRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binfmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"request: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span><span>);</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>req</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>usb</span><span>::</span><span>StandardRequest</span><span>::</span><span>GetDescriptor</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>descriptor</span><span>,</span>
            <span>length</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>match</span> <span>descriptor</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>Descriptor</span><span>::</span><span>DeviceQualifier</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>todo!</span><span>(),</span>
                <span>// .. omitted other cases ..</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>},</span>
        <span>// .. omitted other cases ..</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can execute <code>cargo run</code> to run your embedded program on the target device.
No new Cargo subcommand with new flags to learn; just the built-in <code>cargo-run</code> subcommand you are familiar with.
Then the output would look like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo run
<span>(..)
0.255_560s DEBUG request: GetDescriptor { descriptor: Device, ..
+.000_010s INFO  EPIN0: sending 18B of data

   9: 0x2003d594 - Reset

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>134
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You would get all these detailed <code>binfmt</code> logs but that wouldn't be all.
Upon hitting a panic you would get <em>a stack backtrace</em>; just like the one you would get from a program linked to <code>std</code>.
What's more you also get the non-zero exit code from <code>cargo run</code> when you hit a panic.</p>

<h2 id="unit-testing-on-stable">Unit testing on stable</h2>

<p>Being able to run <code>no_std</code> programs like this enables <code>cargo-test</code>-like unit testing of <code>no_std</code> code <em>on the device</em>.</p>

<p>The only extra required ingredient is a <code>no_std</code> <code>exit</code> function that terminates the <code>cargo-run</code> process with an exit-code equal to 0.
With that you could, for example, write your tests in the <code>src/bin</code> folder.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// src/bin/usb-enumeration.rs</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>#[entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"usb-enumeration: started"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>set_timeout</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>::</span><span>from_secs</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>));</span>
    <span>block_until_enumeration_completes</span><span>();</span>
    <span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"usb-enumeration: passed"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// exit-code == 0</span>
    <span>exit</span><span>();</span> <span>// enumeration completed!</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[interrupt(binds</span> <span>=</span> <span>TIMER0)]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>timeout</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// exit-code != 0</span>
    <span>panic!</span><span>(</span><span>"USB enumeration didn't complete within expected time"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now running your unit tests would amount to running all the binaries in <code>src/bin</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo run <span>--bin</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div>

</span><span size="7">Medawar's Hypothesis on Mammal Aging</span></p>
  
  <p><b>Summary:</b> Medawar's hypothesis contended that 
  beyond a particular age the <b><a href="http://www.programmed-aging.org/evolutionary_benefit.pdf">
  evolutionary benefit</a></b> of a longer life span in mammals was negligible. 
  This species-specific age was greater than and proportional to the age at 
  which the species was first capable of reproduction. Therefore aging has 
  negligible evolutionary effect in mammals.</p>
  
  <p>
  <img src="http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/Peter_Brian_Medawar.jpg" alt="Peter Medawar --- Wikipedia" width="140" height="198">Sir Peter Medawar<!--[if supportFields]> 
  <![endif]-->
  (1915 – 1987) was a noted British professor of zoology and anatomy at the 
  University of London who won the Nobel Prize in medicine (1960) for his work 
  on acquired immunological tolerances. In Medawar’s 1952 paper, <i>An Unsolved 
  Problem of Biology, </i>(originally presented as a lecture at University 
  College London) he presented an ingenious theory, which, in effect, combines 
  the properties of the accumulation of damage theories with Weismann<!--[if supportFields]><![endif]-->’s 
  evolved characteristic<!--[if supportFields]> <![endif]-->theory.</p>
  
  <p>Medawar<!--[if supportFields]> <![endif]-->suggested that the force of natural selection decreases once an 
  organism reaches an age where it has had some opportunity to reproduce. If, 
  for example, some trait of an animal tended to be fatal prior to puberty<!--[if supportFields]><![endif]-->, 
  that trait would be very strongly selected against because most animals having 
  that trait would die before having any progeny and would therefore not pass 
  their adverse trait to descendents. </p>
  
  <p>If, on the other hand, an animal had a trait which caused 
  a fatal effect only after the animal had reached sexual maturity, survived to 
  least one mating season, mated, had progeny, and nurtured and protected those 
  progeny long enough for them to become self sufficient (assuming it is an 
  animal that nurtures and protects young), the effect of that trait on fitness 
  would be relatively insignificant. The negative trait would only affect the 
  animal’s ability to survive yet longer and have subsequent descendents. Such a 
  trait would apparently only weakly affect fitness. Aging seemed to fit this 
  description.</p>
  
  <p>Medawar proposed that 
  even if an animal did not age, that is, did not have an increased probability 
  of death as a function of age, the numbers 
  of adult animals of any given age would decrease exponentially because of 
  deaths due to other causes such as predators, environmental conditions, etc. 
  Some constant percentage of the animals of any given age would be killed in 
  any given time period. As a metaphor, he used the random breaking and 
  replacing of test tubes. If, in a lab with hundreds of test tubes, when a test 
  tube is broken it is replaced with a new (age = 0) test tube, then after a 
  while the number of test tubes of a given age in the test tube population will 
  decline exponentially with age. Figure 4 shows the kind of survivor’s curve 
  (number as a function of age) that would be expected for the test tubes (or 
  ageless animals) as presented in Medawar’s paper. This behavior is known as an
  <i>exponential decline</i> and is characterized as having a <i>half-life</i>. 
  If half of the animals die in four years (as shown here), then half of the 
  remaining half will die in another four years, and so forth. Very old animals 
  would be very rare even in a non-aging species.</p>

  <p>The number of progeny any given non-aging animal would 
  produce was assumed by Medawar to increase linearly with age. An ageless 
  animal would tend statistically to have the same number of progeny every year 
  from puberty to death. The total number of progeny (on average) produced by 
  animals, as a function of their age, would therefore look like Figure 5 in 
  which total descendents produced by an animal are zero until puberty and then 
  increase with age. Puberty is shown here as occurring at age 6. It is assumed 
  that reproductive vigor in an ageless animal would not change with age. (We 
  could have assumed that general reproductive effectiveness and aging were 
  different, independent phenomena. However, an evolved characteristic that 
  causes a decline in reproductive effectiveness has the same problems with 
  Darwin’s mechanics as aging and the same arguments, pro and con, apply.)</p>

  <p>If we multiply the number of progeny produced by animals 
  of a given age by the number of animals at that age we can determine the <i>
  reproductive effect</i> contributed by each age group or <i>cohort</i>. Since 
  the number of animals is exponentially decreasing with age and the number of 
  progeny is only linearly increasing with age, the reproductive effect<!--[if supportFields]>
  <![endif]-->of older animals (and therefore their apparent evolutionary 
  impact) declines. Graphically, this would look like Figure 6 in which 
  reproductive effect rises from zero at puberty to a maximum and then declines.</p>

  <p>These curves, Figures 4-6, represent the <i>traditional 
  model</i><!--[if supportFields]> <![endif]-->of a non-aging species. Medawar’s 
  paper was almost entirely devoted to the development of this model.</p>
  
  <p>You will note that there are no numbers specified on the 
  vertical axes of Figures 5 and 6. Some species, subject to high death rates 
  due to predators or other cause would need a correspondingly high birth rate 
  to survive. Other species would need a lower birth rate.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="_Toc228594167">Problems with Medawar's Hypothesis</a></h2>
  
  <p>Medawar's hypothesis depends on the idea that the 
  evolutionary importance of individuals in a non-aging population declines with 
  calendar age and that therefore natural selection allows the existence of 
  progressively more negative traits with age, up to and including “death of old 
  age.” This idea, the traditional model, is based on a very important 
  assumption, namely, that the evolutionary contribution of each individual 
  animal can be accurately described by “reproductive effect” as described 
  graphically in figure 6.</p>
  
  <p>You will recall that figure 6 reflects the combined 
  effect of the reproductive contribution we could expect from individual 
  animals (figure 5) and the rate at which we could expect the non-aging animals 
  to die off (figure 4). Because the population of older animals declines more 
  rapidly with calendar age than the reproductive contribution of older 
  individuals increases with calendar age, the net effect (figure 6) is that 
  evolutionary importance declines with calendar age beyond some point that 
  varies with age of sexual maturity. This traditional model of a non-aging 
  species is over-simplified and ignores a number of important characteristics 
  of actual animals, all of which tend to increase the evolutionary importance 
  of <i>older</i> animals. </p>
  
  <p>First, the characteristics of Medawar’s test tubes (and 
  non-aging animals) were presumed to be constant and did not change with the 
  age of the test tube. However, the characteristics of actual non-aging animals 
  would change greatly with calendar age, at least between puberty and 
  “maturity.”</p>
  
  <p>Suppose we had a group of prehistoric 15-year-old humans 
  and another group of 20-year-olds. According to the reproductive effect 
  concept, these two populations are equivalent and have the same evolutionary 
  importance. In actuality, the 20-year-olds are superior with regard to 
  essentially any survival characteristic. They are stronger, faster, and 
  smarter. They would win in any competitive situation. It is obvious that a 
  20-year-old has a greater chance for survival than a 15-year-old, everything 
  else being equal. Therefore, death rates would nominally tend to decline with 
  calendar age in the interval between 15 and 20 as opposed to remaining 
  constant as proposed by the traditional model. (In actual animals, still 
  additional complexity such as protection-of-young might affect this.)</p>
  
  <p>There is a more profound difficulty. The curve of figure 
  6 assumes that ten young individuals each producing one descendent have the 
  same evolutionary importance as one older individual producing ten 
  descendents. Because they are more mature, the 20-year-olds more fully exhibit
  <i>adult</i> survival characteristics. A case could therefore be made that a 
  single 20-year-old has more evolutionary importance than any number of 
  15-year-olds. The reproductive effect concept does not take into account this 
  “maturity factor.”</p>
  
  <p>This is the same argument made against Weismann’s theory. 
  Natural selection can not operate relative to a characteristic that is not 
  expressed. Adult characteristics are not fully expressed in juveniles. 
  Therefore, adults are required in order to evolve adult characteristics. 
  Evolutionary importance is not the same as reproductive effect.</p>
  
  <p>Second, the individuals in the population of Medawar’s 
  test tubes were presumed to be identical and have identical characteristics. 
  The characteristics of actual animals <i>vary</i>. More specifically their 
  characteristics regarding capacity for survival vary. Therefore, their 
  probability of survival varies. </p>
  
  <p>The traditional model as shown in figure 4 assumes that 
  the probability of death for an ageless animal is a constant, independent of 
  calendar age. That is, older animals are just as likely to die in any given 
  time period as younger animals. While true for test tubes, this idea is 
  incompatible with the theory of natural selection. According to Darwin, 
  animals that are more fit are less likely to die than animals that are less 
  fit. Therefore, in any given time period, more of the less fit animals in a 
  population would die. At the end of the period, the surviving animals would 
  therefore, on average, be <i>more fit</i> than at the beginning of the period. 
  In other words, average fitness of a non-aging population cohort <i>increases</i> 
  with calendar age. Because older animals are more fit, they are also less 
  likely to die relative to younger animals. The probability of death therefore
  <i>decreases</i> with calendar age in a non-aging population. Figure 4 
  therefore <i>does not</i> accurately represent the relative prevalence of 
  older individuals in a …</p></div></div>

The story goes: you want more than one person in your business to have domain knowledge because they might get hit by a bus! Your business would lose all that experience and expertise in one tragic accident. The premise in isolation sounds ridiculous, but mitigating the “bus factor” is serious business.</p><p>Everything gets a lot easier if you select the right software and framework, primarily if you use Ruby on Rails. Rails itself is a full-stack framework that has a best practice for every piece of a web application. If you are committed to doing things “the Rails way,” you cut the total cost of ownership by A LOT. “Staying on the Rails” makes any new developer productive almost immediately (and will keep them “out of the weeds”). Sticking to the standards evangelized by the community and adding proper documentation (possibly in the form of useful tests) makes onboarding a breeze, which creates more productive developers, which makes hiring more accessible, which reduces your “bus factor.” <br></p><p>The only guaranteed way to save money is to spend it on reducing your “bus factor”. By investing in making the code of your application more straightforward and easier to understand, you make it easier to add developers and reduce the future occurrence of bugs. You’ll make working on your code more enjoyable (reducing the likelihood your developers will want to leave), and possibly most importantly: reduce the barriers (time/money) to building new features. If you haven’t been keeping an eye on this, and find yourself in a position to hire someone, then these tasks will be their first job <strong>every time you hire</strong>.<br></p><p>Thankfully, I have no personal experience with a colleague getting hit by a bus, but I know a few that have been hired by Netflix. Remember to look both ways before crossing a street and never underestimate the amount of money the FAANGs have to poach your talent. It is effortless to lose good talent. When (not if) your developer leaves to make $500k+ a year in the valley, you’ll be in a much better position with a lower bus factor to quickly fill the gap and keep moving forward.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After months of work, I am ecstatic to finally announce <strong>Bevy Engine</strong>!</p>
<p>Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust. It is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">free and open-source</a> forever!</p>
<p>It has the following design goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capable</b>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set</li>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users</li>
<li><b>Data Focused</b>: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm </li>
<li><b>Modular</b>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel</li>
<li><b>Productive</b>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bevy ECS</b>: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance</li>
<li><b>Render Graphs</b>: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes</li>
<li><b>Bevy UI</b>: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy</li>
<li><b>Productive Compile Times</b>: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the "fast compiles" config</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)</li>
<li><b>3D</b>: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading</li>
<li><b>Sprites</b>: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets</li>
<li><b>Assets</b>: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds</li>
<li><b>Plugins</b>: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems</li>
<li><b>Multiple Render Backends</b>: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu</a>)</li>
<li><b>Data Driven Shaders</b>: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms</li>
<li><b>Hot Asset Reloading</b>: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts</li>
<li><b>Events</b>: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems</li>
<li><b>Properties</b>: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names</li>
<li><b>Hierarchical Transforms</b>: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy </li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the "prototyping" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. <span>I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability</span>.</p>
<p>Hopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">The Bevy Book</a> is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note to the reader</strong>: in this article you will find text formatted like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_render/latest/bevy_render/texture/struct.Texture.html"><code>Texture</code>
</a></p>
<p>This formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!</p>
<h2 id="bevy-apps">Bevy Apps</h2>
<p>First, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_default_plugins</span><span>()
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc</p>
<p>You can also register the default <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> manually like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>CorePlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())

        </span><span>/* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */
        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> for simplicity, at least initially. </p>
<h2 id="bevy-ecs">Bevy ECS</h2>
<p>All Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component, whereas another entity might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>UI</code> component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a <code>movement</code> system that runs on all entities with a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.</p>
<p>Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b>: normal Rust structs</li>
<li><b>Systems</b>: normal Rust functions</li>
<li><b>Entities</b>: a type containing a unique integer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rW7ALyHaas">great introductions</a> to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave "getting up to speed on ECS" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>I'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS <em>in existence</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>struct </span><span>Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);
</span><span>struct </span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);

</span><span>// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components
</span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands</span><span>) {</span><span>
    commands
        </span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),))
        .</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>2.0</span><span>),));
}

</span><span>// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component
</span><span>fn </span><span>movement</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Position</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>velocity</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>) {</span><span>
    position</span><span>.</span><span>0 </span><span>+=</span><span> velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;
}

</span><span>// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_startup_system</span><span>(</span><span>setup</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>movement</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs">won't</a> find <a href="https://github.com/TomGillen/legion">any</a> ECS <a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/blob/master/bunny_demo/src/systems.rs">with</a> better <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube">clarity</a> or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write <em>and</em> easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>One of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic <em>super</em> fast, primarily for these two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Iteration Speed</b>: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast</li>
<li><b>Parallelism</b>: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>Bevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular <code>ecs_bench</code> benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:</p>
<h4 id="system-iteration-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">System Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_iter.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<h4 id="world-setup-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">World Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_build.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<p>Note that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. </p>
<p>I have pushed my version of <code>ecs_bench</code> <a href="https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench">here</a> if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking "Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but <em>surely</em> this means you had to compromise on features!"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_f55"><div><p>Data Science and storytelling are inseparable. And the bridge between the two is data.</p><p>I had talked about storytelling in my article about <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/data-science/business-analyst-data-scientist-ecosystem/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Analyst/Data Scientist learnings</a> but thought it would be better to elaborate more about the storytelling part.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Imagine you are a data science executive in an organization. You would be responsible for building machine learning models and analyzing data using statistical techniques to achieve business goals. There will come a time when you will have to present your work to the stakeholders of your project. In a corporate setup, a project has a mix of technical and business stakeholders. Explaining everything to this mixed audience can get tricky. For example –</p><ul><li>How do you explain the complex model building process to a non-technical stakeholder?</li><li>Is it possible to translate model parameters to business actionables and recommendations?</li><li>Is there some way to address this gap?</li></ul><h2>Storytelling to the rescue!</h2><p>Not sure how? Let me explain!</p><p>Data science and machine learning are technical in nature. In other words, it involves complex mathematical computations and methodologies, alongside its implementation in R or python. Hence, intuitively, machine learning models may not be interpretable by a person who does not have a relevant background. Such people might not be able to understand model complexity, computation time, and other model parameters. They may be driven by business goals. They might be more inquisitive about how the model impacts the company’s top-line. Or how well it reflects in numbers on a corporate level.</p><p>In all such situations, there arises a need for a data scientist to assume the role of a storyteller. A data scientist has to make sure that the complex mathematical model yields a fruitful takeaway for every stakeholder involved in the project. They should understand it irrespective of their background in machine learning. Hence, the art of storytelling becomes paramount. Storytelling for data science professionals has the following advantages –&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Helps the stakeholders better understand the value addition of the model</li><li>Increases retention: humans are trained to remember stories better</li><li>Creates a series of logically connected business points leading to the ultimate outcome</li><li>Invokes participation, generates interest</li></ol><p>I will be honest, I have experienced similar situations. Situations where I had to present a solution to a set of stakeholders with varying levels of expertise in machine learning and data science algorithms. After experimenting with different storytelling formats, I would like to tell you about the one which I prefer the most.</p><h2>How can I improve my storytelling skills?</h2><p>I like to call my method of storytelling the “<strong>What-Why-How</strong>” format.</p><p>To understand the framework better, consider the following scenario –&nbsp;</p><p>John was working on a project to predict employee attrition in the organization for over a month. Today is D-day. He is in the meeting room with all the stakeholders involved in the project. After exchanging pleasantries, he starts the presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>“<em>Good afternoon everyone. The data provided to us exhibit non-linear behavior. Hence, we have created a machine learning model called Support Vector Machines with an RBF kernel in python. After doing a grid search for hyperparameters, we were able to estimate that the model performs best with C=1 and gamma = 0.1. The accuracy of the model is 95%</em>”</p><p>There is a silence for 5 seconds. Moreover, some of the stakeholders look confused.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as a data scientist, achieving 95% accuracy should have made everyone happy.&nbsp;</p><h3>What went wrong?</h3><p>Well, John did not realize that the meeting does not have only technical stakeholders. There are stakeholders from the finance and human resources department of the organization as well. He needed to translate his model into a language that the finance and human resources stakeholders could understand.</p><h3>The “What-Why-How” framework</h3><p>The <strong>What-Why-How framework</strong> helps you break down the business problem into 3 parts.</p><ul><li>What was the business problem?</li><li>Why did we want to address that business problem?</li><li>How did we solve the problem (followed by its impact and recommendations)</li></ul><p>Once we are able to translate the project in the above framework, we facilitate –</p><ul><li>A better understanding of the business problem</li><li>Its impact</li><li>Efficacy of the suggested solution</li></ul><p>Consequently, there is an actionable takeaway for every stakeholder that they can implement. (Each machine learning model should always be followed by a set of recommendations for the stakeholders)</p><p>For better understanding, let us try and break the attrition problem into the <strong>What-Why-How framework</strong>.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>What is the problem?</strong></td><td><strong>Why to address it?</strong></td><td><strong>How can we solve it?</strong></td></tr><tr><td>High employee attrition rate in the organisation</td><td><br>1: High investment for the organisation to hire a new employee<br>2: Leads to lowering of employee moral</td><td>1: Machine learning models to estimate what factors contribute the most to attrition<br>2: Helps the human resource department to make informed data decision based on employee feedback</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Some of the insights that John could have presented to the stakeholders are –</p><ul><li>Employees that have stayed in the organization for more than 2 years are less likely to leave</li><li>High average overtime leads to high attrition</li><li>Employees who left did not receive any promotion in the last 2 years</li></ul><p>When the model presents such insights to the human resource stakeholders, they will have a set of actionable insights based on which they can take subsequent actions. Hence, rather than telling them that the model accuracy was 95% with a given set of hyperparameters, John could have told them how the model will impact the organization as a whole. This would have resonated with the stakeholders. They would have related to it better.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In the present scenario, where the technology advancements have made the model building process quick and easy, it has become essential for a data science professional to upskill themselves with the trend. What machines have not been able to do till now, is to make stories out of the data. To create a series of logically connected events to engage with the stakeholders. There is a need to cohesively bind business acumen the data science skills. Hence, every data science professional or an enthusiast should focus on building stories out of the data, not just models.</p><p>I would like to end this article by saying – Do not just be a data scientist, be a storyteller.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this article. Until next time, keep learning!</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10035"><div><div><div><h2>Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.10 to 2.4.44 vulnerable to remote IP spoofing and bluffer overflow attacks</h2><p>Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache servers can be used by potential hackers to remotely trigger IP spoofing and buffer overflow attacks. Apache Server is the open-source HTTP web server for UNIX, Microsoft Windows, among other platforms, developed by Apache Foundation and used by many top websites.</p><p>Apache servers are vulnerable to as many as four vulnerabilities that can be successfully exploited for IP spoofing and buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be used by the remote hackers to get complete control of the webserver hosted by Apache HTTP servers versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.44.</p><p>The first of the vulnerabilities is the limit error in the module&nbsp;od_proxy_uwsgi<em>.</em> This vulnerability has been issued a unique identifier, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11984"><strong>CVE-2020-11984</strong></a>, and has a CVSS score of &nbsp;7.7/10. The flaw is known as Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’) and can be used by potential hackers to remotely execute arbitrary code. Hackers can use the limit error in the Apache server module od_proxy_uwsgi and generate buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution on the target system.</p><p>Apache HTTP server running on version 2.4.32 to 2.4.44 are vulnerable to this flaw.</p><p>The second vulnerability has been issued a unique identifier, <strong><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11993">CVE-2020-11993</a>, </strong>and has a CVSS score of 6.5/10. The flaw resides in the way Apache servers inadequately manage application resources when processing HTTP/2 requests with trace/debug enabled, causing concurrent use of memory pools. Potential hackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to the Apache server to launch denial of service <strong>(DoS)</strong> attacks.</p><p>Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43&nbsp; are vulnerable to this flaw. Configuring the LogLevel of mod_http2 above “info” will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.</p><p>The next one is <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9490"><strong>CVE-2020-9490</strong></a>&nbsp;vulnerability which exists due to insufficient validation of user-provided entries when processing the Cache-Digest header in the HTTP/2 request. Remote hackers can send a specially crafted value to the Apache server for the ‘Cache-Digest’ header in an HTTP/2 request. This would result in a DoS attack and cause a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterward. The flaw affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 and has a CVSS&nbsp;score of 6.5/10.</p><p>The final vulnerability in Apache servers is an input validation error and has been issued a unique identifier, <strong><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11985">CVE-2020-11985</a>&nbsp;</strong>with a CVSS score of 5.7/10. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in an Apache server. A remote attacker can spoof the user’s IP address when proxying using mod_remoteip and mod_rewrite.&nbsp; As result the fake IP address will be displayed in logs and will be passed to PHP scripts.&nbsp;Depending on web application functionality this vulnerability can be used to bypass authorization checks based on IP addresses.</p><p>This vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions from 2.4.1 to 2.4.23.

<p><em>2020 has hit many publishers hard. Nonetheless, there are ways to re-group and minimize the damage.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>As the April 2020 <a href="https://www.iab.com/insights/coronavirus-ad-revenue-impact-sell-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">study by IAB</a> unveiled, the majority of publishers expect their digital ad revenue to decrease in 2020, due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, subsequent lockdown and economic crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, in the light of uncertainty of how the events would unfold, most brands have either cancelled or postponed their online advertising campaigns, cutting their marketing budgets to the minimum until things improve, especially in the video ad segment. More importantly, widely-applied blacklisting practices have also taken a huge toll on the editorial publishing niche.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, now that Q3 is already here, the digital advertising industry is seemingly starting to re-group and slowly recover after the first aftershocks. According to the latest <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/08/10/emarketer-us-b2b-digital-ad-spend-soars-226" target="_blank">eMarketer </a>study, for instance, the B2B digital ad spend is surging over 20%, especially in the tech, healthcare and financial sectors, and is likely to exceed $8 000 000 000 in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, undoubtedly, means new revenue opportunities&nbsp; for publishers are being unlocked, as long as they’re willing to embrace these.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Check out the AdPlayer.Pro tips on how to monetize editorial content more efficiently in 2020.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Leverage your Audience &amp; Increase Subscriptions&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Now is definitely the right time and place to analyze your audience not only in terms of demographics, but also their subscription intent. While hiding the COVID19-related news behind the paywall isn’t perceived as the best practice, finding content creatives your readers will eagerly pay for, on a regular basis is a key. These may imply launching engaging webinars, offering insightful research, sharing on-topic podcasts, but the list of options may vary.</p>



<p>In this respect, you might even consider integrating <a href="https://adplayer.pro/solutions/rewarded">rewarded video ads on your web properties</a> to monetize audience segments, who can’t or aren’t willing to apply for a paid subscription at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Strengthen your Reputation by Mitigating IVT</strong></h4>



<p>It’s essential that you familiarize yourself with your traffic sources and patterns, and review them on a regular basis to identify unusual or suspicious activities in a timely manner.</p>



<p>In this respect, if you’re working with a third-party ad verification vendor, it’s possible to drill down to more detail on particular domains or IPs being the source of IVT, if any.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may happen so that anti-fraud software falsely flags genuine traffic as IVT, if it’s impossible to identify its source. In this case, you need to contact your ad verification provider directly to resolve the issue.</p>



<p>In addition, it’s vital to ensure the proper ad tag integration, so that video ad creative isn’t overlapping the main webpage content.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Leverage Direct Partnerships</strong></h4>



<p>If you’re facing programmatic ad revenue downfall, consider extending your monetization practices by partnering directly with brand advertisers (small or mid-sized companies) in your specific niche or some of the currently hot verticals, like the financial, pharmaceutical, or tech.</p>



<h4><strong>A/B Test Outstream Video Ads on Mobile Web</strong></h4>



<p>Outstream advertising has been on the rise over the past years, and if you have been reluctant to integrate <a href="https://blog.adplayer.pro/2017/10/02/publisher-opportunity-outstream-ads/">outstream video ads</a> on your website, it’s time for a change.</p>



<p>Namely, since the smartphone/tablet traffic on mobile websites has soared in 2020, try experimenting with various <a href="https://adplayer.pro/solutions">outstream video ad formats</a> on mobile web, conducting a/b tests to select the most efficient ad placements. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>This article based on the talk I gave on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4a7aJa__aE" target="_blank">Cocoaheads Kyiv #15</a> in 2019. It’s an overview of how to inject custom code into iOS Simulator with <code>simctl</code>. 
All code examples written in Objective-C.</p>

<hr>

<p>When building products for engineers, you should always consider a “flow” factor. You don’t want to be yet another distraction. So when we were building <a href="https://flawlessapp.io/" target="_blank">Flawless App</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> we started with Xcode &amp; iOS Simulator integrations. Flawless App is a tool to compare iOS app design &amp; implementation in real-time, search for visual bugs, and prevent regressions. It was important to connect to iOS Simulator and overlay design with different filters. Almost as it was a default Simulator’s feature.</p>

<p>Surely there was no official documentation to make this happen. iOS Simulator was never a platform to build on top of. After numerous trials and errors, I found a way to inject our code into Simulator as the “plugin”. It was practically a dynamic library, loaded into one of iOS’s native processes.</p>

<p>Here is our today’s agenda.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intro to <code>simctl</code>. What is it about, and how does it work?</li>
  <li>Method swizzling. Modify code you don’t own.</li>
  <li>Building dynamic iOS libraries.</li>
  <li>Injecting library into Simulator.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="intro-to-simctl">Intro to simctl</h3>
<p>The <code>simctl</code> is a command-line tool that comes bundled with Xcode. It allows basic interactions with the iOS Simulator. To access <code>simctl</code> directly, run the following script in the terminal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl

Command line utility to control the Simulator
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>xcrun</code> is another command-line tool which makes it easier to run all kind of scripts in Xcode. If you’re curious, you can find a <code>simctl</code> at <em>Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/simctl</em></p>

<p>Important note: Simulator isn’t an Emulator. Practically Simulator is a macOS application. All its active processes are accessible from macOS. You can simply type <code>SpringBoard</code> in Activity Monitor and see its details.</p>

<p>I encourage anyone to dive deeper into the <code>simctl</code> documentation. Highly recommend <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10647/" target="_blank">WWDC 2020: Become a Simulator expert</a> session or <a href="https://nshipster.com/simctl/" target="_blank">simctl overview by NSHipster</a> as an introduction. Even without injecting anything into Simulator, using <code>simctl</code> can go a long way.</p>

<p>However, let’s focus on our original task. Here is a few important commands that will come handy later:</p>

<h4 id="simctl-list">simctl list</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, <code>simctl list</code> returns a list of Simulators. If you want to interact with a specific iOS Simulator, you’d need to know its UDID.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl list -j [devices|devicetypes|runtimes|pairs]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-j</code> parameter sets the output to be formatted as JSON. Below is an output example, an array of runtimes, installed devices, and their details.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"devices"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.watchOS-5-2"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"state"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Shutdown"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"isAvailable"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"name"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Apple Watch Series 2 - 38mm"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"udid"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3159F9D3-694F-44C6-A471-BD7856B5CF47"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"availabilityError"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"runtime profile not found"</span><span>
      </span><span>},</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>],</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Knowing UDID you can then interact with a specific Simulator. For example, shutdown a certain device from the command-line</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl shutdown 3159F9D3-694F-44C6-A471-BD7856B5CF47
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally to UDID <code>simctl</code> gives you alias <code>booted</code> to interact with active Simulator. This alias should be used cautiously though. Since Xcode 9 the user can launch many Simulators simultaneously. In such a situation, <code>booted</code> alias forwards the request to the last active Simulator.</p>

<h4 id="simctl-spawn">simctl spawn</h4>
<p>The <code>spawn</code> is one of those commands that make iOS Simulator plugins a reality. In simple words, <code>spawn</code> is launching certain processes/scripts in the system. Following the path below you can find various internal scripts/tools bundled with iOS Simulator Runtime.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/usr/....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those tools include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>log</code> – a tool to interact with internal iOS Simulator logs.</li>
  <li><code>leaks</code> – a tool to inspect a process for possible memory leaks.</li>
  <li><code>malloc_history</code> – a tool to display allocation histories for the selected process.</li>
</ul>

<p>To launch any of those tools simply type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl spawn booted &lt;NAME OF THE TOOL&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s more important is that now you also have access to <code>launchctl</code>. This is a service that manages all the daemons, scripts, and apps in the system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl spawn booted launchctl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="method-swizzling">Method swizzling</h3>
<p>Another handy tool in our arsenal is method swizzling. Put it simply, swizzling means replacing the implementation of code you don’t have direct access. I should mention though swizzling isn’t a requirement for Simulator plugins. However, most of the time changing system behavior can unlock great possibilities.</p>

<p>Under the hood the concept of method swizzling based on Objective-C runtime. I’m not going to dig deep into the topic now. This can easily become a separate article. Instead, let’s get to minimal swizzling knowledge for our needs.</p>

<p>Starting with some basic terminology. Each class has a so-called dispatch-table. This table maps which selector corresponds with function/implementation. Each row in dispatch-table defines <code>Method</code>, <code>Selector</code>, and <code>IMP</code>. Let’s say we have the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@interface</span> <span>HelloRuntime</span><span>:</span> <span>NSObject</span> 
<span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>hello</span><span>:(</span><span>NSString</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>text</span><span>;</span>
<span>@end</span>

<span>@implementation</span> <span>HelloRuntime</span>
<span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>hello</span><span>:(</span><span>NSString</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>text</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>NSLog</span><span>(</span><span>@"Hello, %@!"</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, a simplified representation of dispatch-table would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[ Method: "hello" ] → [ Selector: @selector(hello:) ] → [ IMP: NSLog(@"Hello, %@!", text) ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an example, let’s say we want to replace the implementation of <code>hello:</code> method to always print the same string in <code>NSLog()</code>. Here comes Objective-C Runtime. It allows us to change dispatch-table during the execution. So to replace the implementation of <code>hello:</code> we simply need to add a new dispatch-table record with Original Selector mapping to our alternate implementation, and Selector of alternate method mapping to the original implementation. This is done to prevent the breaking chain of calls. When replacing implementation you can’t easily tell whether any other methods depend on the original method being called at the right time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>alt_hello</span><span>:(</span><span>NSString</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>text</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>[</span><span>self</span> <span>alt_hello</span><span>:</span><span>@"Hello, Injection!"</span><span>]</span>

	<span>// DO NOT CALL original [hello:] here as it will lead to infinite loop</span>
	<span>// [self hello:@"Hello, Injection!"];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The basic setup is ready. Now let’s change the dispatch-table records with Objective-C runtime. 
First and foremost, all swizzling operations better execute as soon as class loads itself into memory. This way we can avoid having instances with different dispatch-tables. There is a convenient static method <code>load</code> for it. Additionally, to ensure we modify dispatch-table only once we’ll be using <code>dispatch_once</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>load</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>static</span> <span>dispatch_once_t</span> <span>onceToken</span><span>;</span>
	<span>dispatch_once</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>onceToken</span><span>,</span> <span>^</span><span>{</span>
		<span>...</span>
	<span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, we’d need to get the Class of interest. So runtime would know which dispatch-table we try to modify.<br>
Then get Selectors for original and alternative methods. Having those in place we can easily switch implementations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>load</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>static</span> <span>dispatch_once_t</span> <span>onceToken</span><span>;</span>
	<span>dispatch_once</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>onceToken</span><span>,</span> <span>^</span><span>{</span>    
		<span>Class</span> <span>class</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>self</span> <span>class</span><span>];</span>

		<span>SEL</span> <span>originalSelector</span> <span>=</span> <span>@selector</span><span>(</span><span>hello</span><span>:</span><span>);</span>
		<span>SEL</span> <span>swizzledSelector</span> <span>=</span> <span>@selector</span><span>(</span><span>alt_hello</span><span>:</span><span>);</span>

		<span>Method</span> <span>originalMethod</span> <span>=</span> <span>class_getInstanceMethod</span><span>(</span><span>class</span><span>,</span> <span>originalSelector</span><span>);</span>
		<span>Method</span> <span>swizzledMethod</span> <span>=</span> <span>class_getInstanceMethod</span><span>(</span><span>class</span><span>,</span> <span>swizzledSelector</span><span>);</span>

		<span>method_exchangeImplementations</span><span>(</span><span>originalMethod</span><span>,</span> <span>swizzledMethod</span><span>);</span>
	<span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So here we have it. Whenever the system calls <code>hello:</code>, an alternative implementation of <code>alt_hello:</code> runs. And whenever <code>alt_hello:</code> gets called – original implementation of <code>hello:</code> is executed.</p>

<h3 id="building-dynamic-ios-libraries">Building dynamic iOS libraries</h3>
<p>iOS Simulator plugins are technically just dynamic libraries. Those libraries are being injected into a specific process before it starts. The basic property of dynamic libraries is that they can be loaded on demand. Unlike the static libraries that have to be loaded during the application start only.</p>

<p>Another core difference, the static library has to be present inside the executable. Obviously, the actual executable becomes bigger &amp; slower to load. Dynamic libraries stored in executable as references. So the code from dynamic library loads from a specified location in the system.</p>

<p>Whenever the system starts application it loads code and resources into the memory. In the meantime, the system also starts a dynamic loader (<code>dyld</code> in macOS) for this new process. Then dynamic loader searches for necessary libraries per reference. It uses environment variables to know where to search for libraries. There are several variables available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> – dynamic loader tries to search for libraries specified here before looking for system libraries.</li>
  <li><code>DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH</code>– this is the second path dynamic loader considers. In case there were no libraries found in <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.</li>
  <li><code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> – libraries at this path will be loaded before those specified by the application. That means libraries at that path are temporary. Because they will be available only as a part of the current session.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last variable is the one of interest for us. It’s temporary. You don’t want to break iOS Simulator forever because of your plugin, do you?</p>

<h3 id="injecting-library-into-simulator">Injecting library into Simulator</h3>
<p>Sadly Xcode doesn’t have a template for iOS dynamic library. In this case, .framework would be overkill. 
So let’s create a new project using the macOS dynamic library template. Then simply adjust Build Settings according to screenshots below.</p>



<p>Next, let’s create a new <em>Main.m</em> file to define a starting point for our library. There are multiple ways how you can do this for the plugin. The first way is to define the construction method which will be called automatically, the second is to leverage <code>load</code> method. 
In this case, let’s stick to the construction method approach. The GCC and Clang support constructor and destructor attribute defined as <code>__attribute__((constructor)…</code></p></div></div>

<p>Hello dear readers,</p>
<p>Today’s article is about some experiments I’ve been doing with Tekton CI/CD + Prometheus.</p>
<p>Continuous Integration and Deployment is becoming more and more a hot topic - everyone wants a 100% automated, flawless, fast, code integration, and deployments. </p>
<p><strong>But how can a team or a company achieve that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usually</strong> is a step-by-step process and not a ready-to-install solution (if there’s one though, please tell me !! ;) ).</p>
<p>For that reason, metrics will help you to keep track of your CI/CD improvements and to understand what needs to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Luckily, if you are using <strong>Tekton</strong>, there are some very useful metrics by default.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn’t find enough documentation on the metrics exposed by Tekton. However, after a few experiments, I came up with a list of what (in my opinion) are the most valuable metrics.</p>
<p>The demo I’ve prepared uses Prometheus as a backend to collect and display metrics, but note that others backends (such as StackDriver/Cloud Monitoring) are supported too. </p>
<h3>Tekton CI/CD: Useful Indicators</h3>

<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_taskrun_count{status="failed"} * 100 / ignoring(status) tekton_taskrun_count{status="success"} &gt; 15</code></pre></div>
<h4>Monitor the Tekton Controller</h4>
<p>The 2 metrics below are more likely to expose issues related to K8s rather than Tekton:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_workqueue_adds_total -&gt; 
It’s the number of required actions per unit time. 
A high value could indicate problems in the cluster of some of the nodes.

------

tekton_workqueue_depth -&gt; 
It’s the number of actions waiting in the queue to be performed. 
It should remain in low values.</code></pre></div>
<p>These are very basic examples, and there’s other cool stuff that you can do with these indicators. You could, for example, monitor how many pods/resources have been allocated into a project, how much time users are wasting in retries, how many seconds are wasted on latency, pods latency, Workqueues and so on!</p>
<p>Measuring pipelines is, in my opinion, something that every company who wants to move towards a data-driven mindset should do.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;How to setup Tekton to use Prometheus</h3>
<p>As stated before, Tekton comes with Prometheus as default backend. The user just needs to ensure that metrics are enabled on the Tekton configuration.</p>
<p>Inside the namespace where the Tekton Pipeline Controller is installed, there is a configmap called “observability” or “tekton…-observability”. Inside that configmap, there’s the configuration that will then be used by Knative/Tekton Controller to expose metrics.</p>
<p>The observability configuration is explained here:
<a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/edc453934a183d44fde739dc24d6ca6b25cdeb6b/config/config-observability.yaml">https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/edc453934a183d44fde739dc24d6ca6b25cdeb6b/config/config-observability.yaml</a></p>
<p>Once Tekton is configured, the only bit missing is the related Service Monitor to allow the Prometheus Operator to scrape the exposed metrics!</p>
<p>The service monitor configuration should look like:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  annotations:
    meta.helm.sh/release-name: prometheus-operator-1595779515-custom-sm

  labels:

    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm

    release: prometheus-operator-1595779515
  name: prometheus-operator-159577-tekton-pipeline-controller
  namespace: tekton-demo

      app.kubernetes.io/instance: tekton-pipeline-1593528871
      app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    path: /metrics
    interval: 15s</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s all from me, hope you enjoyed today’s article :)</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbed">Ryan Bednar</a></strong> (CEO of <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/">RankScience</a>)</p>
<p><span>Last week on July 29, 2020, the CEOs of the most powerful tech companies in the world—including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple—were called in to testify in front of the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The event was widely considered to be mostly political theater, a performance act for Congress to look like they’re hard on Big Tech. But the tech titans took it seriously, knowing the one thing that actually determines whether antitrust legislation moves forward: how each company fares in the court of public opinion. The company taking the most heat from both Democrats and Republicans was, without a doubt, Google. They’re also the company that’s most likely to be regulated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The antitrust case against Google is the most straightforward of any of the big tech companies. Google started out as an almost benevolent index of the world wide web, showing users ten blue, unbiased links for whatever users were searching for. But over the years, Google has steadily favored showing their own products above organic search results, even when their own products arguably aren’t as good. Rand Fishkin </span><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-in-2020-from-everyones-search-engine-to-everyones-competitor/"><span>says that</span></a><span> in 2020, Google has gone “from everyone’s search engine to everyone’s competitor.”</span></p>
<p><span>As the founder of an SEO company, </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/"><span>RankScience</span></a><span>, and as someone who’s been working in growth and digital marketing for more than a decade, I’ve had a front-row seat to watch Google devour screen real estate to feature its own products. From my point of view, Google is squeezing businesses more than ever and the game is increasingly rigged in Google’s favor. Small and local businesses have almost no chance at succeeding with SEO because they don’t have the budget or resources for it. To make things worse, so much screen real estate is now taken up by Google’s own products, small businesses have no choice but to pay Google for search traffic. Even if users are searching directly for a business’s name, Google controls the appearance and experience of interacting with that business.</span></p>
<p><span>Local restaurants, for example, are forced to use Google’s partner ChowNow in order to have convenient “Order Pickup” or “Order Delivery” buttons in search results for their own name, which charges an added hefty fee to the restaurant for each order, hurting their already thin margins. During the global pandemic, this is an incredibly predatory shakedown. No small business should be forced to use Google’s preferred ordering mechanism, and pay a tax to Google, simply to allow a customer to search for their business. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Ben Thompson of Stratechery wrote a great post summarizing the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">antitrust issues each tech behemoth has</a>, yet highlights his issues with Google’s position: “Google’s anticompetitive behavior is relatively clear…the company consistently favors its own properties in search results, particularly ‘above-the-fold’…that is, results that are not actually search results but which seek to answer the user’s query directly.” A few examples:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png" alt="ben thompson stratechery google antitrust regulation issues" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png 419w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px"></p>
<p><span>Take a look below at how Google-owned YouTube results take up the vast majority of the screen on a simple video search. Other competing video products like Vimeo or Twitch don’t get the same visual treatment or preference in search results. You can barely see the first organic search result for this query:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png" alt="google YouTube video search results" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png 929w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-272x300.png 272w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-768x847.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-600x662.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px"></p>

<p><span>The problem gets even worse when we’re talking about more lucrative search categories, like flight search or finding a hotel. On the flight search example below (which also includes a Covid-19 travel warning), Google Ads and Google’s own Flights product take up the entire screen, any organic search results pushed below the fold. When searching for “hotels near cape may, nj” the actual organic search results were almost two pages below the fold. How many users do you think scroll that far, instead of clicking on Google’s products?</span></p>

<p><span>Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other companies have been complaining about unfair treatment by Google </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html"><span>for years</span></a><span>, but left unfettered, Google is only going to continue to expand their own products into more search categories over time. The list of companies with grievances against Google is growing. The landscape for businesses to compete in search is increasingly competitive, and the companies who succeed in search over the long-run are using advanced tactics like SEO A/B testing and NLP content optimization, which the average business can’t afford.</span></p>
<p><span>On a recent episode of the </span><a href="https://www.allinpodcast.co/"><span>All-In Podcast</span></a><span>, Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya, and esteemed guests engage in a rigorous and detailed debate about Big Tech antitrust and censorship (I recommend </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Ewtt593ZsFT5QXJSB97wR?si=Ej5Bx4UMRwqrU4ruSog06w"><span>giving it a listen</span></a><span> if you haven’t, as it covers the strongest arguments both for and against Big Tech regulation). Chamath says what I think most people don’t want to admit:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>The internet is now a pervasive and critical part of human infrastructure. As such, there needs to be people that regulate and manage the internet</b><span>—the same way that the FAA manages and regulates planes, and wind turbines, etc.… Let’s take aviation [for example], it’s impossible for you to go into your garage and build a plane that takes people from point A to point B. Take agriculture [for example], it’s impossible for you to build up a farm and supply it to Safeway, without any checks and balances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are very specific kinds of businesses and business models that should be overseen. The first and most important thing is a body [that] oversees the collection of user data and privacy and identification. The second one is essentially something that tears the fig leaf off of internet companies and says, you know what, you are the equivalent of a publisher and a platform, some weird hybrid that we didn’t think could exist when we wrote these rules, so we’re now going to adapt these rules. If you think about it, nobody is happy with the internet publishers today. The left thinks that it skews right, the right thinks it skews left—everybody is confused. Nobody gets what they want and somebody has to step in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You go to a movie and it tells you who can go to the movie or not. You buy an album and it tells you whether there’s explicit lyrics or not. Before you turn on the TV, there’s some rating agency that tells you whether your kid should be watching with you. My point is: what is the equivalent version here? We all need to think about what it is, but for there to be nothing is crazy.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Google search is fundamentally the gateway to the internet for the majority of people and an arbiter of truth in our digital age. Google has a </span><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"><span>dominant market monopoly position</span></a><span>, a treasure trove of sensitive information on hundreds of millions of users. It’s incentivized to return value to shareholders and extract more value from search over time, which is at odds with doing right by businesses and citizens. Their business model doesn’t require them to act in the long-term interest of businesses and citizens, and because they have a monopoly on a utility that’s become essential to our day-to-day lives, the only solution is for the government to enforce guidelines on fair behavior within search.</span></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We recently raised 1,5M euros from LocalGlobe, Seedcamp, Kima &amp; Tiny.vc. This funding will allow us to focus on building a community of early adopters &amp; contributors around our open search engine <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch">MeiliSearch</a>.</p><p>We are still at the very beginning of our open source adventure and we are thrilled to see that more and more people believe in this project. This is our first fundraise and it means the world for the Meili team 🎉</p><h3 id="meili-got-funded-">Meili got funded!</h3><p>Meili SAS (the company) was created in November of 2018 with the idea of building an alternative to existing search engine APIs like Algolia. After some successes and failures as a team and company, we decided to raise some money to keep focus on building MeiliSearch and its ecosystem.</p><p>We believe that an exceptionalsearch experience on websites and applications should be the norm, not an exclusive feature. Thus we are building the most straightforward technology for developers to offer state-of-the-art search to their users, scaling from the tiniest of operations all the way up to enterprise.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/david-armstrong-srpE-a5W418-unsplash.jpg"></figure><h2 id="how-we-got-there">How we got there</h2><p>MeiliSearch has been open source since the <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/open-source-or-not/">earliest days</a> of its development. As developers, we made our project accessible on GitHub from day one but without the idea of being an "open source company". First and foremost we set out to make a simpler alternative to Algolia for smaller businesses who needed something more developer-friendly and affordable.</p><p>After describing our project to many developers, we quickly realize that one of the main differences from Algolia was that MeiliSearch is open source. Still we weren't using open source as a force.</p><p>In late 2019, after some substantial discussion within the team, we decided to <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/to-open-source-and-beyond/">fully commit to orienting the business around open source</a>. We could not quietly bootstrap anymore since we decided to build a community around our project to get feedback and contributions from external developers. </p><p>We wrote our <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-beta-release/">Beta release blog post</a> for MeiliSearch in November of 2019. Since then we have been working hard at making MeiliSearch the new obvious choice for developers when it comes to building a search box.</p><p>Charlotte, who joined us in August of 2019, did an incredible job of directing the writing and making of our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> while Clémentine, who joined us one month later, took charge of developing the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs and integrations</a> to ease the use of MeiliSearch.</p><h2 id="fundraise">Fundraise</h2><p>In late 2019 we began to meet with investors because we knew we wouldn't be able to develop the business without help from industry veterans.</p><div><p>The first key meeting that we had was with <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis from Kima</a> who helped us make our pitch understandable to VCs. Alexis was presented to us as <code>THE investor who understand tech</code> in Paris. Not only did he understood what we wanted to build, he also did an amazing job at introing us to relevant funds regarding our stage &amp; business 😁 </p><p> Then from meeting to meeting we met the different persons we are now working with: <a href="https://twitter.com/mishmashkautsan?lang=en">Mish</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/knightwebb/?originalSubdomain=uk">Louis</a> from <a href="https://localglobe.vc/">LocalGlobe</a> as lead investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/siahouchangnia?lang=en">Sia</a> from <a href="https://seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis</a> from <a href="https://www.kimaventures.com/">Kima</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/pmoe?lang=en">Philipp</a> from <a href="https://www.tiny.vc/">Tiny.vc</a>.</p></div><p>The deal we made with the VCs is that we develop the community and the usage around MeiliSearch while we better understand the use-cases of our search engine. From there we will be able to generate revenue. <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-open-business-plan-v0-1/">Our business plan is publicly available</a> as a iteratively developed document.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><h3 id="core-features">Core features</h3><p>We made an <a href="https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/projects/2">open roadmap on GitHub</a>, and we will publish more roadmap communications in the coming weeks to get better feedback on what developers need in a search engine API.</p><p>There are some features that we know we need to build in order to be competitive as a search engine backend (basic analytics and authorization system 🚧) that are already planned. We are also discussing with developers &amp; companies to gain more insight on features that should be game-changers in the enterprise search industry!</p><h3 id="integrations-documentation">Integrations &amp; Documentation</h3><p>All of this work around MeiliSearch would not make any sense if MeiliSearch is not used. To ease the integration of MeiliSearch we are building different <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs</a> in different languages and improving our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> every week. </p><p>We want anyone to be able to integrate MeiliSearch in any common programming environment in less than 5 minutes. Today, with our most mature front- and back-end libraries you should be able to setup a proof-of-concept in less than an hour. We are hard at work shaving off those remaining 55 minutes to get where we want to be.</p><h3 id="open-source-values">Open source &amp; values</h3><p>As we learn to build a commercial open source software company, we are thriving for transparency on everything we do. To raise awareness around open source sustainability, Erlend is publishing a podcast called <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/value-in-open-1-posthog/">Value in Open</a>. We already have our first episode released, and the second one should follow shortly 😁</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/kelly-sikkema-XX2WTbLr3r8-unsplash-1.jpg"></figure><p><br>We are delighted and excited about the future of MeiliSearch 😁 if you want to reach us for anything, <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/resources/contact.html">please feel free to do so</a>!</p>

<p>Dramatic title, I know, but lately I've had a few people ask me what extensions I use, and through sharing my list I've learnt of even better ones, so what better way to amplify these positive effects than to leverage the internet? 😛</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump into it.</p><h3 id="privacy-badger-ublock-origin"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp">Privacy Badger</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">UBlock Origin</a></h3><p>Let's block all the ads! Sites look cleaner, load waayy faster, and pry less. These are the first extensions I install on <em>any</em> browser. </p><h3 id="nano-defender"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a></h3><p>Let's block all the anti-adblockers! Many sites these days will try to get you to turn off your adblocker, but once you set up <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a>, you'll no longer have to deal with that. Note: To use alongside Ublock Origin, I had to go through a <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">few extra steps</a> first.</p><h3 id="hover-unpaywall-bypass-paywalls"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok/related">Hover</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>/ ByPass Paywalls</h3><p>Let's block all the login/paywalls! Are you starting to see a pattern here? 😛 The web can be full of thrash sometimes. With <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok">Hover</a> &amp; <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>, I can say goodbye to Medium and journal paywalls. If you're a fan of open source and have an extra minute to spend, check out this <a href="https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome">extension</a> instead.</p><h3 id="shut-up"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a></h3><p>Sometimes when I'm consuming content, I'll be tempted to see what others are saying about it. That's... not always good. Let these xkcd comics illustrate my point:</p><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.maskys.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png"></figure><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a> disables comments everywhere. When I trust a platform's audience enough to read the unfiltered outputs from their brains, I enable comments for just that site. Sometimes I turn it back off immediately 💀</p><h3 id="reader-mode"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en">Reader Mode</a></h3><p>Occasionally, even after all these purges, the content on a site will still be ridiculously hard to read- sometimes because they used a funky font and set the size to 8px, or sometimes because there are a million other article suggestions, plus three sidebars, plus an obnoxious navigation header that never goes away.

<p>UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are often confused. I’ve heard the phrase “I can’t use this, it looks like garbage.” many times and it’s always bothered me. I recently had the opposite experience when I bought a brand spanking new Sonos Playbar. People loved this sound bar for its audio quality, but also claimed it was extremely difficult to set up. I consider myself to be a tech savvy person, and thought there would be no way I’d have difficult setting this thing up. Oh boy… I was completely wrong.</p>



<p>When I first purchased it I was extremely excited to set it up. The unboxing was great and the app was beautiful. I thought to myself, “Maybe the reviews I read were old and no longer valid. Maybe Sonos figured their stuff out and fixed all of the setup issues.” With how nice the app looked, so simplistic and modern, I thought that surely they wouldn’t have put this much effort into the UI and left the setup experience on the back burner. Well, that’s exactly what they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problems started the moment I tried to connect my phone to the Playbar. This sound bar has WiFi, yet it couldn’t connect to my WiFi (I tried multiple times, rebooted, etc). I had to physically connect it to my router only to get a few steps further and then not work again. I tried the steps over and over again with no success. It was such a frustrating experience. I factory reset the dang thing several times and started from scratch each time. At my <strong>wit’s</strong> end, I was ready to call my dad who was also excited about me getting it and tell him that I’m going to return it because it just doesn’t work. I decided to try one more time and voila! Finally it worked!</p>



<p>This was my first impression of owning a Sonos Playbar. It was a horror story that left a sour taste in my mouth. Now that I have it set up and it’s working and sounds amazing (and I mean really amazing) that sour taste is fading away, but there were moments that I was considering returning it.</p>



<p>This is a problem with a lot of software. A good UI does <strong>NOT</strong> fix a bad UX. There are many apps that are considered beautiful but extremely difficult to use. There is a trend towards software developers becoming more full stack and end to end. Software developers design UIs, UX, code the front end, back end, work on maintaining the app, etc. I love this for the breadth of knowledge it teaches us and the experience it gives us for when we want to create our own apps. But at the same time, it has many new software developers focusing a lot on beauty and leaving UX to suffer. With all of the latest design trends and beautiful looking apps, of course new developers want their apps to be beautiful.</p>



<p>Look at websites like Facebook and Reddit. Until recently they had very outdated UIs but people still used them because of the value they offered and how easy they were to use. People’s grandmas and grandpas use Facebook because the user experience is frictionless enough for them. Luckily, these days there are a variety of front end UI frameworks that handle almost all the UI work for you allowing you to focus on the UX. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank">Material-UI</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://get.foundation/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> are just a few of the amazing frameworks out there.</p>



<p>Basically, what I’m trying to say is that more emphasis needs to be put on user experience than the UI (ideally you put a lot of emphasis on both). I feel a great app can be ruined or even killed behind a bad UX. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:dominik@nerdstack.io">dominik@nerdstack.io</a> if you have a different opinion, any questions, or just want to chat.</p>

    <p>I guard my favorite sketches until I can work on a good story. Yet I acknowledge I won't ever find the time to write stories for all of them. Stories serve to describe how I experienced a given location, person, or object, or to elaborate a concept that lightly relates to a featured drawing.</p>
<p>Always timestamped, illustrations evoke memories of sketched <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/time-place-and-people">artifacts, places, and people</a>. However, when removed from their surrounding context, drawings act as timeless, platonic abstractions.</p>
<p><a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/the-windy-road-to-korakonisi">The windy road to Korakonisi</a> brings me back to a one-off drive around Zakynthos with Aziz and Mikela. <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/coronavirus">We are out of face masks</a> teleports me to a conversation with Sanjay from Paris to Toronto in times when few people wore face masks around. But floating sketches of my Hatefjäll IKEA office chair make me think of the <em>idea</em> of this chair and not about a particular moment in time in which I was using it. What color is this chair? Is it comfortable? Is it adjustable?</p>
<p>Whereas a contextualized sketch is imbued with memories of the time and place in which it was sketched, a sketch of an item without context sparks thoughts of the item itself, not about the moment in which you sketched it (except when the item itself is representative of a salient event or moment in time).</p>
<p>A similar effect can be achieved documenting memorable events and abstract ideas with other mediums.</p>
<p>I'm repeatedly surprised by the power of drawings, texts, videos, photos, audio notes, and smells for memory reactivation.</p>

<p>Fred is on your team. He takes 5 times longer to build a feature than anyone else. When asked what’s the hold up, Fred responds that he’s tweaking a class definition or adding some out of scope automation instead of just building the dang thing that the ticket says to build. Fred drives the team nuts, and he often gets called a gold plater, or unproductive, or slow. </p>



<p>But in my experience, Fred isn’t slow at all. He’s just as productive as everyone else, but he’s solving different problems than the ones he was asked to solve.</p>



<p><strong>Fred is more interested in providing value to other developers than to users.</strong> </p>



<p>Your team probably pushes back on that. Fred’s feedback (if he gets any at all, which is a topic for another post) is that he needs to work on his velocity and get through his tickets faster. In other words, you’re telling him to stop doing the thing that he loves. He can’t just change his interest, so the best case scenario is that he’ll push hard for a few months on the boring stuff until he burns out and quits, or falls back into his old habits.</p>



<p>Maybe Fred doesn’t need to change. Maybe he’s just <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331248">in the wrong seat</a>. What if the team leaned into what gets Fred excited? If he doesn’t care about providing value to users, but loves providing value to his fellow developers, then could that be his full time job? His responsibilities could include:</p>



<ul><li>Automating anything that can possibly be automated</li><li>Making local environments run faster and smoother</li><li>Refactoring and managing tech debt</li><li>Quick and thorough code review</li><li>Streamlining the deploy process</li><li>Writing missing automated tests</li></ul>



<p>Doesn’t it seem powerful, to have a person on your team completely dedicated to helping other developers be as productive as they can be? Imagine reaching out to Fred the second you had code ready for review, or when a build fails and you aren’t sure why, or when your can’t figure out why your debugger stopped debugging, or when you notice that some function over here basically does the same thing as some other function over there. </p>



<p>He loves that stuff, and he’s probably really good at it, because as they say, “being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points”. So maybe try letting him do it?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/53bde489c28f22db0ca85d16d348e36b6af44214/7bc7c/images/everyday-design.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>There’s a secret code embedded in every app, website, and interface you use. Underneath your fingers is a hidden world traveled by the interface designers, caught up in a war between the complexities of technology and the breakneck evolution of user needs. These designers speak cryptically in neologisms (squircle, sharrow, neumorphism) and food-themed shibboleths (hamburger menu or meatball menu? Candy bar or toast?).</p>
<p>Their code is made of things called affordances. Those fluent in the language of affordances possess an intuitive and powerful understanding of how design works.</p>
<p>So let’s take a trip into the depths of interface design and shine a light on affordances. We’ll study them, explore how they work, and see how they define our digital tools. Bringing affordances out of the shadows can lead to clearer conversations about design, no matter if you’re a veteran designer or a casual user.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-affordances">The history of affordances</h2>
<p>In 1988, Don Norman published a book called <em>The Design of Everyday Things.</em> At the time, Norman was transitioning from a career in cognitive science and psychology to one in technology&nbsp;— he was one of the first people to write about “human-centered design,” an approach to technology that focuses on human biology and psychology to create functional software and hardware. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> was the genesis of many of these ideas, including one he called “affordances.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norman’s explorations of usability design, human-centered-design, and universal design all serve as the foundation of modern digital product design. But it’s the concept of affordances that has taken on a life all its own. Designers have taken the original definition and transformed it slightly: today, designers use “affordances” to mean “properties of objects which show users the actions they can take.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Here’s an example of an affordance in the real world:</p>
<p>A handle on a door is an affordance: it indicates that the door should be pulled. A flat, rectangular plate on a door is an affordance indicating that it should be pushed.</p>
<p>Norman would say that a handle or a plate is a <em>good affordance</em>, because of its relationship to the person who is using the door. A plate on a door begs to be pushed. Without edges or round parts to grab, the natural way&nbsp;— the only way&nbsp;— of interacting with it is to push. A good door handle, on the other hand, is located right where your arm naturally falls when reaching for the door. The radius of the handle is the right size to give you a good grip. It’s located on the side of the door opposite the hinge, so the door isn’t too hard to open.</p>
<p>Some doors don’t have good affordances. To make up for the confusion, there’s a “PUSH” or “PULL” sign. The sign doesn’t take advantage of the way our bodies instinctively interact with the door; it’s only helpful to people with good vision, who happen to be paying attention, or aren’t in too much of a hurry.</p>
<p>So, a good affordance takes advantage of some natural interaction between a thing and its user. Something that’s supposed to be used with your hands ought to be hand-shaped (and ambidextrous!). If something has visual feedback mechanisms, those mechanisms should be at eye level. Things arranged in physical space&nbsp;— like a row of lights, or a set of stovetop burners&nbsp;— should have their controls arranged in a corresponding way.</p>
<p>But we don’t always have a physical relationship to the tools we use.</p>
<p>Our phones, laptops, tablets, watches, and earbuds have so many functions that many interactions are digital by default. What does a good affordance look like in the digital world? If good affordances are ones that suit the nature of the interaction, what happens when the interactions are finger (or mouse pointer) on a flat, glass surface?</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-affordances">The evolution of affordances</h2>
<p>Designers of early computers had to figure out what good digital affordances looked like. Most built clues into interfaces based on familiar physical objects: things stored in your computer’s memory are called files, and files are grouped into folders. How do you use a real-world folder? You open it. So, we can easily find the right command for accessing our digital folders because it’s labeled “open.” These affordances have been around for more than 70 years.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Some designers had to reckon with entirely new functions, ones that didn’t have any real-world equivalent. For instance, how do you represent a hyperlink&nbsp;— a piece of text that fluidly joins two documents together? Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, had to figure it out. He chose a blue underline. But there’s no reason why blue means “link”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the first WWW client&nbsp;… used just underline to represent [a] link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn’t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color&nbsp;— I don’t remember which was the first to use blue.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early days of the web, hundreds of affordances were coined this way. The URL for a page goes at the top. Text appears in a vertically scrolling column. A dropdown menu has a downward-pointing triangle next to it. Your mouse cursor is a slanted triangle with a tail, and when you hover over a link it looks like Mickey Mouse’s glove.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of these affordances don’t have any relationship to the physical characteristics of the interaction they mediate. But remove them from a website, application, or interface, and users get disoriented, frustrated, and unproductive.</p>
<p>This is a second way of thinking about good affordances: instead of being useful because they are natural, some affordances are useful because they’re norms. Designers employ commonly recognized icons, patterns, labels, and layouts to make it easy for new users to find and utilize functionality. As Jakob Nielsen puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Design for patterns for which users are accustomed.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This circular definition underscores how important it is for digital interface designers to understand affordances. In fact, how a designer sees, uses, understands, and breaks the rules of affordances is a telling sign of their experience and abilities.</p>
<h2 id="how-designers-use-affordances">How designers use affordances</h2>
<p>Early in a designer’s career, they’ll <strong>use affordances</strong> even without knowing. That’s how I got started in design: I copied other designer’s work as a starting point, instead of starting from scratch. I had no idea why certain elements worked the way they did&nbsp;— but by emulating more experienced designers, I could take a shortcut past my lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>But design enough of the same kind of thing&nbsp;— t-shirts, band posters, MySpace pages&nbsp;— and you’ll start to recognize common elements. <strong>Recognizing affordances</strong> might not come with a detailed understanding of the <em>why</em>, but at least many inexperienced designers can identify the <em>what</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding affordances</strong> comes from a place of curiosity. This means questioning affordances&nbsp;— why are links blue? Why is most text left-aligned? Why are user avatars usually cropped into circles? Sometimes the answers to these questions are rooted in psychology, biology, anthropology, or technology.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>But affordances sometimes exist for no obvious reason. As I use the same affordances over and over, I think, “is this really the right way to do things?” As the internet enters its fourth or fifth decade,<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> many designers are <strong>abandoning affordances</strong> once taken for granted. Google, for example, is in the middle of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-kill-url-first-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a battle to kill the URL</a>, one of the few remaining affordances that distinguish a web page from an app.</p>
<p>Finally, as old affordances are being left behind, designers are <strong>inventing new affordances</strong> to take their place. Small touchscreens have become the dominant mode of interaction with digital interfaces,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> and designers created new ways of indicating functionality. The “hamburger” menu is one example: three horizontal lines indicates where to tap to expand a menu, something only required on small screens where some elements have to be hidden.</p>
<figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/722ac6cacbdd4e5bfdc4f43a6db10fb634bb846b/9cfa1/images/everyday-design-1.jpg" alt="A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu"><figcaption>A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="affordances-everywhere">Affordances everywhere</h2>
<p>Understanding the correct application of affordances is one of the most fundamental jobs of designers of functional things. This won’t change anytime soon: as long as we’re interacting with the world around us, designers will need to maintain a mental library of affordances.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Affordances are the hidden language of interface design. Using affordances wrong can stunt a company’s growth, as Snapchat famously discovered.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> Using them right has returns in <a href="https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions</a>, <a href="https://articles.uie.com/beyond_ux_tipping_point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intranet-usability-the-trillion-dollar-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillions</a> of dollars.</p>
<p>For that reason, affordances are, and will always be, the things of everyday design.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WebAssembly (wasm) allows code written in languages other than JavaScript to run on browsers. If you haven’t been paying attention, all the major browsers support wasm and <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">globally more than 90% of users</a> have browsers that can run wasm.</p>
<p>Since Rust compiles to wasm, is it possible to build SPAs (Single Page Applications) purely in Rust and without writing a single line of JavaScript? The short answer is YES! Read on to learn more or visit the <a href="https://rustmart-yew.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo site</a> if you can’t contain your excitement!</p>
<p>We’ll be building a simple ecommerce site called “RustMart” that will have 2 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>HomePage - list all the products that the customer can add to cart</li>
<li>ProductDetailPage - show the product details when a product card is clicked</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m using this example as it tests the minimal set of capabilities required to build modern SPAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate between multiple pages without page reload</li>
<li>Make network requests without page reload</li>
<li>Ability to reuse UI components across multiple pages</li>
<li>Update components in different layers of the UI hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>Follow this <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to install Rust if you haven’t done so already.</p>
<p>Install these Rust tools:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install wasm-pack          # Compile Rust to Wasm and generate JS interop code
$ cargo install cargo-make         # Task runner
$ cargo install simple-http-server # Simple server to serve assets</code></pre>
<p>Create a new project:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --lib rustmart &amp;&amp; cd rustmart</code></pre>
<p>We’ll be using the <a href="https://yew.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Yew</code></a> library to build UI components. Let’s add this and wasm dependencies to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
yew = "0.17"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"</code></pre>
<p>Create a new file named <code>Makefile.toml</code> and add this:</p>
<pre><code>[tasks.build]
command = "wasm-pack"
args = ["build", "--dev", "--target", "web", "--out-name", "wasm", "--out-dir", "./static"]
watch = { ignore_pattern = "static/*" }

[tasks.serve]
command = "simple-http-server"
args = ["-i", "./static/", "-p", "3000", "--nocache", "--try-file", "./static/index.html"]</code></pre>
<p>Start the build task:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make build</code></pre>
<p>If you’re new to Rust, I’ve written some <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/tags/Rust-Beginners/">guides for beginners</a> which will help you follow this post better.</p>
<h2 id="Hello-World"><a href="#Hello-World" title="Hello World"></a>Hello World</h2><p>Let’s start with a simple “hello world” example:</p>

<p>Lot of things going on but you can see that we’re creating a new component named “Hello” that renders <code>&lt;span&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;</code> into the DOM. We’ll learn more about Yew components later.</p>
<p>Start the serve task in a new terminal and load <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make serve</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It works!! It’s only “hello world” but this is fully written in Rust.</p>
<p>Let’s learn about components and other SPA concepts before proceeding further.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-in-Components"><a href="#Thinking-in-Components" title="Thinking in Components"></a>Thinking in Components</h2><p>Building UIs by composing components and passing data in a unidirectional way is a paradigm shift in the frontend world. It’s a huge improvement in the way we reason about UI and it’s very hard to go back to imperative DOM manipulation once you get used to this.</p>
<p>A <code>Component</code> in libraries like React, Vue, Yew, Flutter etc have these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to be composed into bigger components</li>
<li><code>Props</code> - Pass data and callbacks from that component to its child components.</li>
<li><code>State</code> - Manipulate state local to that component.</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> - Manipulate global state.</li>
<li>Listen to lifecycle events like “Instantiated”, “Mounted in DOM” etc</li>
<li>Perform side effects like fetching remote data, manipulating localstorage etc</li>
</ul>
<p>A component gets updated (re-rendered) when one of the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parent component is re-rendered</li>
<li><code>Props</code> changes</li>
<li><code>State</code> changes</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> changes</li>
</ul>
<p>So, instead of imperatively updating the UI when user interaction, network requests etc happen, we update the data (Props, State, AppState) and the UI is updated based on this data. This what someone means when they say “UI is a function of state”.</p>
<p>The exact details differ across different libraries but this should give you a general idea. If you’re new to this, this way of thinking might take sometime to “click” and get used to.</p>
<h2 id="HomePage"><a href="#HomePage" title="HomePage"></a>HomePage</h2><p>Let’s build the HomePage first. We’ll be building the HomePage as a monolithic component and later decompose it into smaller reusable components.</p>
<p>Let’s create the following files:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>use</span> yew<span>:</span><span>:</span>prelude<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> Home <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> Component <span>for</span> Home <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> Message <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        Self <span>{</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> _<span>:</span> Self<span>:</span><span>:</span>Message<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> ShouldRender <span>{</span>
        <span>true</span>

        <span>html!</span> <span>{</span> <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>"Home Sweet Home!"</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>span<span>&gt;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>mod</span> home<span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> home<span>:</span><span>:</span>Home<span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s update the <code>src/lib.rs</code> to import the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  // src/lib.rs
<span>+ mod pages;</span>

<span>+ use pages::Home;</span>
  use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>- struct Hello {}</span>

<span>- impl Component for Hello {</span>
<span>-     type Message = ();</span>
<span>-     type Properties = ();</span>

<span>-     fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {</span>
<span>-         Self {}</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {</span>
<span>-         html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Hello World!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-     }</span>
<span>- }</span>

  #[wasm_bindgen(start)]
  pub fn run_app() {
<span>-   App::&lt;Hello&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
<span>+   App::&lt;Home&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
  }</code></pre>
<p>Now, you should see “Home Sweet Home!” instead of “Hello World!” rendered in your browser.</p>
<p>Let’s start designing the <code>State</code> of this component:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to store a list of products retrieved from server</li>
<li>Store the products the user has added to cart</li>
</ul>
<p>We create a simple struct to hold the <code>Product</code> details:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Product <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    description<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    image<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    price<span>:</span> f64<span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We then create a new struct <code>State</code> with field called <code>products</code> to hold the products from server:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> State <span>{</span>
    products<span>:</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>Product<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the full list of changes in the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ struct Product {</span>
<span>+     id: i32,</span>
<span>+     name: String,</span>
<span>+     description: String,</span>
<span>+     image: String,</span>
<span>+     price: f64,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>+ struct State {</span>
<span>+     products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>- pub struct Home {}</span>
<span>+ pub struct Home {</span>
<span>+     state: State,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  impl Component for Home {
      type Message = ();
      type Properties = ();

      fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {
<span>+       let products: Vec&lt;Product&gt; = vec![</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 1,</span>
<span>+               name: "Apple".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/apple.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 3.65,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 2,</span>
<span>+               name: "Banana".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An old banana leaf was once young and green".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/banana.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 7.99,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       ];</span>

<span>-       Self {}</span>
<span>+       Self {</span>
<span>+           state: State {</span>
<span>+               products,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       }</span>
      }

      fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {
<span>+        let products: Vec&lt;Html&gt; = self</span>
<span>+            .state</span>
<span>+            .products</span>
<span>+            .iter()</span>
<span>+            .map(|product: &amp;Product| {</span>
<span>+                html! {</span>
<span>+                  &lt;div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;img src={&amp;product.image}/&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{&amp;product.name}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{"$"}{&amp;product.price}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                }</span>
<span>+            })</span>
<span>+            .collect();</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>+        html! { &lt;span&gt;{products}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-        html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Home!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
      }
  }</code></pre>
<p>The <code>create</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is created and this is where we set the initial state. For the time being, we’ve created a mock list of products and assigned it to the <code>products</code> inside the state as initial value. Later, we’ll fetch this list using network request.</p>
<p>The <code>view</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is rendered. Here we’ve iterated over <code>products</code> inside state to generate product cards. If you’re familiar with React, this is same as the <code>render</code> method and the <code>html!</code> macro is similar to <code>JSX</code>.</p>
<p>Save some random images as <code>static/products/apple.png</code> and <code>static/products/banana.png</code> and you’ll get this UI:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s implement the “add to cart” functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep track of all products added to cart in a new state field called <code>cart_products</code></li>
<li>We render a “add to cart” button for each product</li>
<li>Add logic to update the <code>cart_products</code> state when “add to cart” button is clicked</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ #[derive(Clone)]</span>
  struct Product {
      id: i32,
      name: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      price: f64,
  }

<span>+ struct CartProduct {</span>
<span>+     product: Product,</span>
<span>+     quantity: i32,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  struct State {
      products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,
<span>+     cart_products: Vec&lt;CartProduct&gt;,</span>
  }

  pub struct Home {
      …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>B J Fogg is a Stanford professor who came up with a simple model of behavior that helps us understand why we take action or not take action at any given moment.</p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>According to FBM, there are three things we need to do something:</p><ul><li>Motivation</li><li>Ability</li><li>Trigger</li></ul><p>The key is that we need to have all three at the same time in order to act.</p><p>Since our problem is procrastination, we'll focus on how we fail at each one of these.</p><h2>Motivation X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_motivation.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no motivation"><p>Sometimes we have the ability to do something, and even have a trigger like a time window and a to-do item, but we don't feel motivated.</p><p>We stare at a list of tasks, and stare, and stare, and none of them seem particularly exciting.</p><p>So we do something else - procrastinate.</p><p>The thing is,&nbsp;<strong>motivation doesn't come out of the blue.</strong></p><p>We often have a fantasy in our heads of ourselves, sitting down to work, feeling inspired and tearing into work with a smile on our faces.</p><p>That's often not how it goes.</p><p>On the days when we don't feel motivated,&nbsp;<strong>we need to build motivation.</strong></p><h3>How to build motivation</h3><p>We feel motivated when we viscerally feel how an action is&nbsp;<strong>meaningful, or valuable</strong>&nbsp;to us and when we&nbsp;<strong>believe we can</strong>&nbsp;take it (we'll get to this in the next part).</p><p>Therefore, we don't feel motivated when we don't see the meaning or value hiding behind a to-do item.</p><p>What to do about it then?</p><p><strong>Remind yourself of the why.</strong></p><p>There probably was a reason why you wrote down a task or got one assigned to you.</p><p>Was it to help you learn something?        Was it to make you money?        Was it to help someone?</p><p>Take a task you're putting off, and try to remember in vivid detail why you thought you needed to do it.</p><p>The important part is not only to know the reason, but to feel it, to get excited about it. How to do that? Link the task to a personal goal that you want to achieve. Attach exciting reasons to the task.</p><p><em>Write a thesis</em>&nbsp;  - not motivating.</p><p>Write a thesis to successfully complete a degree and do cutting-edge research.<br>Write a thesis to deepen your understanding of a subject and get recognized by others in your field.<br>Write a thesis to help others see things more clearly and make progress.</p><p><strong>Add personal, meaningful reasons to the tasks that you put off. Make yourself remember why you took them on.</strong></p><h2>Ability X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_ability.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no ability"><p>Sometimes we feel motivated, but every task on our plate seems just too darn hard, like standing at the foot of 5 different mountains in the Himalayas and having to decide which one to climb.</p><p>When everything seems hard, it's easy to succumb to procrastination and check email, or social media, or play games. All those actions are much easier than&nbsp;<em>work.</em></p><p>But when&nbsp;<strong>we're finally done with our procrastination, we'll often find that our work hasn't gotten any easier while we procrastinated.</strong>&nbsp;In fact, it seems even harder.</p><p>That's clearly not a good cycle.</p><p>Instead of avoiding anything hard, let's&nbsp;<strong>turn down the difficulty dial by focusing on small steps.</strong></p><p>You probably can't climb the whole mountain at once, but you can ascend a few hundred feet.        You probably can't write a whole thesis at once, but you can write 5 paragraphs.        You probably can't build a business at once, but you can write a blog post, or design a prototype, or contact 10 prospects.</p><p>In short, you need to&nbsp;<strong>break it down</strong>&nbsp;into pieces you are able to complete.</p><h3>How to break work down</h3><p>With mental work, it's often not obvious what all the things we need to do are.</p><p>We need to identify them, to list them.</p><p>If you need to create a presentation, you'll need to research the topic, find images, create the slides, and rehearse. Those are 4 distinct types of activity, 4 smaller pieces that you can take on, one by one.</p><p>When you break down work into parts, it becomes clearer what you feel you can or cannot do.</p><p><strong>Identify the distinct parts that form the whole.</strong></p><p>But even when you identify the parts, they can still intimidate you and seem too hard in their own right. What to do then?</p><p><strong>Create a simple timeline.</strong></p><p>We aren't naturally good at planning work through time. We don't look at a task like "Create a sales report" and see a detailed calendar in our heads with all the tasks neatly organized.</p><p>But we can learn to do that. How?</p><p>We just need a simple timeline.</p><p>It doesn't have to be complicated.</p><ol><li>Start with the due date.</li><li>Go back day by day (or week by week) and write down what you'd like to have done by then, until you arrive at today.</li><li>Put this timeline where you'll see it (remember: out of sight, out of mind).</li><li>Start working on the first piece of the puzzle.</li></ol><p>You might have a 20 slide presentation you'll be delivering 10 days from now.</p><p><em>Day 10</em>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Rehearse 3x and deliver presentation</li></ul><p><em>Day 9</em></p><ul><li>Add finishing touches</li><li>List sources</li></ul><p>...</p><p><em>Day 5</em></p><ul><li>Create first 10 slides</li></ul><p><em>Day 3</em></p><ul><li>Write out the main points</li></ul><p><em>Day 2</em></p><ul><li>Read through the materials</li></ul><p><em>Day 1</em></p><ul><li>Make a list of at least 10 articles and other resources to use</li></ul><p>Even a simple, bulleted timeline like this can make a large project more manageable and ensure that you have the time to learn what you need to do to be able to accomplish your mission.</p><h2>Trigger X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_trigger.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no trigger"><p>And sometimes, we feel motivated and able, but we don't know where to start - we're missing a trigger.</p><p>Professional athletes have a coach. Coach is the person who says what to do, and when. Their job is about motivating, cultivating ability, and giving triggers.</p><p>Now do this, now that, now this here, now rest. There's a tight, minute-by-minute plan.</p><p>As a result, the athletes know exactly what to focus on at any given moment.</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>modern work often doesn't have a built-in trigger.</strong></p><p>A professor doesn't tell you when to research, when to write an outline, when to start writing, when to stop writing, when to edit... there are no stopwatches, only vague directions and loooong time windows (days, weeks, months - not minutes).</p><p>As a result,&nbsp;<strong><em>we</em>&nbsp;have to make the decision to start—we have to trigger ourselves into action.</strong></p><p>In effect, we often leave the trigger to circumstance - we start working just before a deadline because we suddenly understand that if we don't start RIGHT NOW, we won't make it. Deadline becomes the only trigger we obey.</p><p>But that doesn't make for a consistent work ethic and healthy work-related confidence.</p><h2>How to add a trigger</h2><p>The key to an effective trigger is a sense of&nbsp;<em>I'm supposed to be doing this, right now.</em></p><p>The timeline exercise from the previous section can help with the first part - identifying a concrete task that will be triggered. However, a timeline doesn't provide us with a&nbsp;<em>cue.</em></p><p>We need to&nbsp;<strong>create a cue.</strong></p><p>One moment that can be used as a trigger is sitting down to work.&nbsp;<strong>When you sit down to work, you can take your to-do list and give yourself 5-15 minutes to decide which task to start with.</strong>&nbsp;If you don't know after the time has passed, pick one at random.<br>Cue #1: sitting down to work = time to find the first task.<br>Cue #2: time limit ends = time to work.</p><p>Another cue takes a little foresight and preparation.</p><p><strong>At the end of one work day, determine where you want to start the next day and put it into your calendar.</strong></p><p>Want to start writing a doc for your teammate? Put it on your calendar at 9–9:30AM, add a reminder and a link to the doc.</p><p>Want to start with a brainstorm? Take a sheet of paper, write the topic in its center, and put it on your desk so that it's the first thing you see tomorrow morning.</p><p>Want to start by looking up flights for a business trip? Download a picture of a plane and make it your wallpaper.</p><p>You can be as creative as you want, but the main point is this:<br><strong>define a specific task to do, at a specific place, at a specific moment in time - and make sure you can't miss the cue.</strong></p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>That's it.</p><p>Build up your motivation by reinforcing personal, meaningful reasons to do something.</p><p>Break down complex tasks into simple parts and plan them through time by creating a simple timeline.</p><p>And define a concrete trigger that will help you start your work.</p><br><hr><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-stop-procrastinating-by-using-the-fogg-behavior-model-part-2">Read How to stop procrastinating by using the Fogg Behavior Model - Part 2 here</a></p></article></div>]]>

To do this, we’ll use a common dataset — the MNIST dataset—and a standard deep learning task—image classification</p><p id="08c0">The goal here is to walk through an example that will illustrate the processes involved in building a convolutional neural network.

This is important because the shape will be needed by the convolution layer. We’ll use this shape later to reshape the size of the input data.</p><pre><span id="2997">x_train.shape</span><span id="9e48">(60000, 28, 28)</span></pre><p id="c58b">We kick off by initializing the <strong>sequential</strong> model. Then we pass in our layers as a list. The first layer is the <strong>reshape</strong> layer for changing the shape of the input data. We already know that each image has a size of 28 by 28. We also pass 1 to the reshape layer to ensure that the input data has a single color channel.</p><p id="320f">Next, we create the convolution layer. This layer takes in a couple of parameters:</p><ul><li id="9f47"><strong><em>filters</em></strong> — the number of output filters in the convolution, i.e the number of feature detectors. 32 is a common number of feature detectors used.</li><li id="266b"><strong><em>kernel_size</em></strong> — the dimensions of the feature detector matrix. This is the width and height of the convolution window.</li><li id="95d7"><strong><em>input_shape</em></strong> — the shape of the input data. Since we included a reshape layer, we don’t need to pass this.</li><li id="a1c3"><strong><em>activation</em></strong> — the activation function to be uses. The <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReLu activation function</a> is a common choice.</li></ul><p id="9830">The next item on the list is to add the<strong> pooling layer.</strong> In this step, the size of the <strong>feature map</strong> is reduced by taking the maximum value during the pooling process. 2 by 2 is a commonly-used pool size. This will reduce the size of the feature map while maintaining the most important features needed to identify the digits.</p><p id="d2e9">After that, we <strong>flatten</strong> the feature maps. This will convert the<strong> </strong>feature maps into a single column.</p><p id="ecea">The results obtained above are then passed to the <strong>dense layer</strong>. The parameters passed to this layer are the number of neurons and the activation function. In this case, those are 128 and ReLu, respectively.</p><p id="f796">Finally, we created our <strong>output layer</strong>. 10 is used here, because our dataset has 10 classes. We’ll use the <strong>softmax activation function </strong>because<strong> </strong>classes are mutually exclusive—an image can’t be, for example, classified as numbers 0 and 1 at the same time. If the case was otherwise, we’d use the <strong>sigmoid activation function</strong>.</p><pre><span id="88d8">model = Sequential([</span><span id="e17a">Reshape((28, 28, 1)),</span><span id="5886">Conv2D(filters=64,kernel_size=(3,3),activation=’relu’),</span><span id="c4ed">MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),</span><span id="c5bd">Flatten(),</span><span id="e185">Dense(128, activation=’relu’),</span><span id="7053">Dense(10, activation=’softmax’)</span><span id="99ce">])</span></pre><h2 id="fa74">Compiling the Network</h2><p id="8a88">We now need to apply <strong>gradient descent</strong> to the number. This is done at the compile stage. We pass the following parameters:</p><ul><li id="4091"><em>optimizer</em> — the type of gradient descent to use; in this case, we’ll use stochastic gradient descent</li><li id="24ca"><em>loss</em> — the cost function to use. We use <code>sparse_categorical_crossentropy</code><em> </em>because the classes are integer-encoded. Had we performed one-hot encoding, we’d have to use the categorical cross-entropy loss function.</li><li id="6fd9"><em>metrics</em> — the evaluation metrics to monitor; in this case, accuracy</li></ul><pre><span id="f23b">model.compile(optimizer=’sgd’,</span><span id="1b59">loss=’sparse_categorical_crossentropy’,</span><span id="d899">metrics=[‘accuracy’,])</span></pre><p id="3cb4">Next, we fit the training set to the network. <code>epochs</code> is the number of rounds the data will pass through the network. <code>validation_data</code> is the test dataset that will be used to evalutate the performance of the model during training.</p><pre><span id="f3be">model.fit(x=x_train,y=y_train,epochs=5,validation_data=validation_data)</span></pre><h2 id="404d">Evaluating the Network</h2><p id="ced8">We can now check the performance of the network. We do so using the <code>evaluate</code> function, passing in the test set. The first item in the result produced is the <code>loss</code>, and the second is the <code>accuracy</code>.</p><pre><span id="b542">model.evaluate(x_test,y_test)<br>313/313 [==============================] - 2s 8ms/step - loss: 0.1116 - accuracy: 0.9668<br>[0.1115519180893898, 0.9667999744415283]</span></pre><h2 id="c6d5">Checking the Predictions</h2><p id="e655">Let’s now see if our network is able to correctly identify a digit. We kick off by making predictions:</p><pre><span id="6043">predictions = model.predict(x_test)</span></pre><p id="8d16">For example, let’s check the digit at index 2 in the test set.</p><pre><span id="c8b9">image = x_test[2]</span><span id="7b62">fig = plt.figure</span><span id="0430">plt.imshow(image, cmap=’gray’)</span><span id="7e5e">plt.show()</span></pre><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/572/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png" width="286" height="247" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/572/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png 286w" sizes="286px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="a0d4">This is clearly the digit one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d9ec1b9bae718486f906"><div><p>There is only one rule of accounting club: “Cash is King”. At least that is what Ted Green, my high school business teacher, would tell me. Ted, the spitting image of Gene Wilder, would say things like, “You’re not going to Penn State, but State Penn” or “Forget Yale, how about jail?”. I always looked forward to hearing his pithy comments of the day. However, the one that stuck with me is, “Cash is King”.</p><p>It seems like such an obvious statement. But it’s one that many people forget — especially when it comes to social media. God, I hate comments like, “Followers are the new currency.” Try to pay for dinner with your followers. Let me know how it goes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Not All Audiences Are Equals</strong></p><p>Yes, building an audience makes you money. The larger your audience, the more money you make. But all audiences aren’t equal. This is especially true when it comes to TikTok.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, TikTok rocks! My iPhone tells me I spend 48 minutes a day on the app. Lately, my feed consists of people dancing to Taylor Swift. The words Marry Me Juliet are seared into my head (you only understand that reference if you use TikTok).</p><p>But !00,000 followers on YouTube are more valuable than 100,000 followers on TikTok. Let me explain why.</p><p><strong>Monetization for Creators</strong></p><p>At the moment, there are only two ways to directly monetize on TikTok:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Payment through the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362060/tiktok-creators-fund-recipients-david-dobrik-brittany-tomlinson-youtube-adsense" target="_blank">TikTok Creator Fund</a></p></li><li><p>Gifts from fans during live videos</p></li></ol><p>Many creators do monetize indirectly through their audience — for example, merchandise, affiliate links and brand partnerships.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube monetization is more robust. YouTube offers creators five direct ways to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/product-features/monetization/#merch-shelf" target="_blank">monetize their audience</a>:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Advertising</p></li><li><p>Channel Memberships — monthly subscription for member-only channels</p></li><li><p>Super Chat and Super Stickers — gifts during live streams</p></li><li><p>Merch shelf — buy official merchandise from the creator through YouTube</p></li><li><p>Subscriptions — YouTube creators earn money from YouTube Premium subscribers based on watch time</p></li></ol><p>This is in addition to other indirect monetization options available to creators.&nbsp;</p><p>A side by side comparison already shows that YouTube is the exceptional platform. It’s deeper than just the monetization options on the surface. It also boils down to user engagement.</p><p><strong>YouTube vs TikTok — User Experience</strong></p><p>When I use TikTok, I‘m only on the For You page. Yes, I follow people, but I have never gone to the Following tab. I think that the majority of users focus on the For You page.</p><p>For TikTok, this user experience gives new content creators hope. Someone with zero followers can go viral overnight. The problem is that building a loyal community is next to impossible. You are constantly vying to make the For You Page.</p><p>This is in contrast to YouTube’s experience. YouTube encourages content creators to build a community. It prioritizes users to watch the people they follow over people they don’t follow. Yes, it’s harder to find newer content on YouTube, but the experience centers around the community.&nbsp;</p><p>This makes monetization better in the long-run on YouTube. YouTube encourages consumption of the content creators you follow while TikTok encourages consumption-based on your interest.</p><p>TikTok is like a parasite for most content creators. Its algorithm makes TikTok money at the expense of creators.</p><p>I write all of this knowing that it’s probably irrelevant. TikTok will be banned in the United States. Even if it’s purchased the algorithm, that drives it, will be forever changed. If anything, I hope the lesson you learn by reading this is that followers don’t equal monetization. Yes, TikTok drives engagement, but it doesn’t build community for content creators. Thus, depriving TikTok creators of maximizing their earning potential. So always remember: “Cash is King.”</p><p><em>Thanks to </em><a href="https://twitter.com/jakemcgraw?lang=en"><em>Jake McGraw</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSinger"><em>Adam Singer</em></a><em> for their thoughts on this essay.</em></p><p><em>This post was inspired by my podcast with Brian Bosche, TikTok Influencer.

This idea took root and, over the years, we've gradually started tackling the surrounding challenges, such as:</p><ul><li><p>a fast and reliable build system much needed in front-end development, </p></li><li><p>various JS interop features that spawned an ecosystem of well typed libraries,</p></li><li><p>a production-ready standard library,</p></li><li><p>and recently, a fresh, solid syntax.</p></li></ul><p>These developments have attracted many people into our community. But one bigger challenge persisted: newcomers dropped out at the sheer amount of extra incongruent tools and learning overhead from having to understand OCaml concepts, Reason concepts, and BuckleScript's own concepts. Take, for example, what's required to make a ReasonReact app:</p><ul><li><p>Knowledge of React.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of JS.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of ReasonReact's specific idioms (that we've tried hard to keep to a minimum).</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of OCaml idioms, on top of which BuckleScript is built.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of BuckleScript's JS interop and the build system.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of the Reason syntax.</p></li></ul><p>Ironically, the more documentation we pile up, the more mental overhead newcomers suffered. During the various BuckleScript &amp; Reason meetups, we've frequently seen folks' enthusiasm crushed at the sheer prospect of making a web app while keeping 5+ tabs' worth of documentations open. This was discouraging, both for said eager developers and for us maintainers. </p><p>The adoption barrier is real, and it's about time we finally solve it.</p><p>Today, we'll start to truly unify the various BuckleScript-related projects under a single name: ReScript. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>The compiler, the build system and the syntax unified and shipping under a single install. Likewise for future efforts such as editor plugin.</p></li><li><p>A single documentation site which covers the above: <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescript-lang.org</a>.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined communication through said website, a <a href="https://forum.rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new dedicated forum</a> and a new <a href="http://twitter.com/rescriptlang" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p></li><li><p>The renaming of various tools, always in a backward-compatible way.</p></li></ul><p>In short, all JS-related tools are now called ReScript. Previously, due to the messy situation, most real-world BuckleScript adoption came from a few heroic community members suffering through the technical and social risk of spreading our tech to their coworkers. From today onward, you can simply tell to your coworkers: "this is ReScript", and point to them a clear starting point instead of sending them to various incompatible sources, with a risk of losing goodwill and credibility.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that while this rebranding seems to be very disruptive, in reality it's mostly a bunch of name changes for the same tech. To reiterate our stance on existing userland code:</p><ul><li><p>Please read our <a href="https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> on backward compatibility with pure OCaml &amp; Reason syntax.</p></li><li><p>The current Reason website will keep existing, with proper redirects to our new one when relevant. Existing Reason-to-JS users' code keep working, as per above post. Reason itself will continue tackling the parts BuckleScript didn't tackle before, such as native.</p></li><li><p>The various BuckleScript binaries will keep working. Instead of renaming those, we'd create new binaries instead.</p></li><li><p>The BuckleScript docs will redirect to the new site without breaking links.</p></li></ul><p>Thank you for your support and keep shipping. A brighter future awaits us!</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>The ReScript team (Bob, Cheng, Cristiano, Maxim, Patrick, Ricky).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I mentioned in an earlier post&nbsp;about <a href="https://www.michaelfasani.com/2020/a-change-is-coming/">my intention to learn more about the AWS&nbsp;eco-system</a>, as I plan to take a more hands-on approach to my personal DevOps needs. I am pleased to say that I am super happy with the learning progress I have made in the past few&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<h2 id="tldr----omit-in-toc---"><a href="#tldr----omit-in-toc---" aria-label="tldr    omit in toc    permalink"></a>TL;DR <!-- omit in toc --></h2>
<p>I have outlined the steps I took to automatically build, deploy and host this Gatsby blog on AWS. I have created my perfect continuous integration and continuous deployment process, which I am sharing here with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>To make changes to my site, I open a pull-request to the main branch on GitHub. I can preview the branch changes using Gatsby Cloud before merging. To complete the process, I merge the branch into main, and the changes are automatically deployed to my Amazon S3 bucket and distributed to all 216 points of presence (PoPs) on the AWS CloudFront&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>Now I have an almost&nbsp;perfect <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lighthouse score</a> from any location and a fast, highly secure, highly available&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>My site runs under the www subdomain, and I wrote a 301 serverless redirect function to route all traffic there, which is the perfect scenario for a solid SEO&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<p>During this process, I gained exposure&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby Cloud</a> for building my Gatsby site and the&nbsp;following <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS services</a> for hosting&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There are multiple options to consider when hosting a Gatsby&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>I took reference from the following pages on&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gatsbyjs.org</a> site, but I feel like these guides are a little short on the details in some places, so I made this a step-by-step&nbsp;guide.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/s3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deploying Gatsby Sites to S3 +&nbsp;Cloudfront</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/s3/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Getting started with Gatsby Cloud and&nbsp;S3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to swap out various sections of this guide with your own preferences. Perhaps you prefer to use a different process to build your site or have a more complex 301 redirect strategy. I have tried to separate the content into logical sections, but because of the nature of a build system, this is not easy. I have tried to explain when and why I have done things to make this guide more&nbsp;useful.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-set-up-gatsby-cloud"><a href="#step-1-set-up-gatsby-cloud" aria-label="step 1 set up gatsby cloud permalink"></a>Step 1: Set up Gatsby&nbsp;Cloud</h2>
<p>Gatsby Cloud is free for personal projects and single-purpose sites. If you only plan to build a single repository you can continue to use it for free with up to 100 real-time edits per month, the free tier will probably work for most personal&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>If you plan to host several sites, you should consider the first pay tier on Gatsby Cloud is currently $19 per month which would enable 250 real-time edits per&nbsp;month.</p>
<p>Another point to note is that Gatsby Cloud currently only works with GitHub hosted repositories. They plan to add more soon (GitLab, Bitbucket,&nbsp;Google).</p>
<h3 id="connect-github-to-gatsby-cloud"><a href="#connect-github-to-gatsby-cloud" aria-label="connect github to gatsby cloud permalink"></a>Connect GitHub to Gatsby&nbsp;Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.gatsbyjs.com</a>.</li>
<li>Sign up with your GitHub&nbsp;account.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add a site&nbsp;+</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong><em>Organization</em></strong>, <strong><em>Repository</em></strong> and <strong><em>Branch</em></strong> you wish to&nbsp;build.</li>
<li>Skip or&nbsp;Add <strong><em>Integrations</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Create site</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your site will start building to the Gatsby staging servers, assuming the build is successful you will now be able to view it on a Gatsby staging URL (eg:&nbsp;https://build-random-string.gtsb.io).</p>
<p>To learn more about Gatsby Cloud&nbsp;and <strong>Data Source (CMS)&nbsp;Integrations</strong> check out&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby Cloud Docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adding-password-protection-to-the-gatsby-staging-environment"><a href="#adding-password-protection-to-the-gatsby-staging-environment" aria-label="adding password protection to the gatsby staging environment permalink"></a>Adding password protection to the Gatsby staging&nbsp;environment</h3>
<p>A neat feature of Gatsby Cloud is the preview environment, you can add password protection to keep the staging environment private. It could be great for showing changes to clients before pushing them&nbsp;live.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong><em>Site Settings &gt; General &gt; Access&nbsp;Control</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Edit</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong><em>Password Protected</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a password in&nbsp;the <strong><em>Preview Password</em></strong> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now your Gatsby Cloud site staging URL will be password&nbsp;protected.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-set-up-an-amazon-s3-bucket"><a href="#step-2-set-up-an-amazon-s3-bucket" aria-label="step 2 set up an amazon s3 bucket permalink"></a>Step 2: Set up an Amazon S3&nbsp;bucket</h2>
<p>We will need to do several things to prepare an S3 bucket for Gatsby Cloud to deploy too. We will create a&nbsp;new <strong>IAM User</strong> and a&nbsp;new <strong>S3 bucket</strong>.</p>
<p>Gatsby Cloud will need the following bits of information from AWS.&nbsp;An <strong>Access Key ID</strong>, <strong>Secret Access Key</strong> and&nbsp;an <strong>S3 Bucket Name</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-iam-user"><a href="#create-a-new-iam-user" aria-label="create a new iam user permalink"></a>Create a new IAM&nbsp;User</h3>
<p>In the AWS Management Console go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Identity and Access Management&nbsp;(IAM)</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a&nbsp;new <strong><em>IAM User</em></strong> called <strong><em>GatsbyCloudAmazonS3FullAccess</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Give the&nbsp;user <strong><em>Programmatic access</em></strong>.</li>
<li>For the user permissions choose to&nbsp;manually <strong><em>Attach existing policies&nbsp;directly</em></strong> and search for and&nbsp;select <strong><em>AmazonS3FullAccess</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the wizard and make a note of&nbsp;the <strong>Access key ID</strong> and <strong>Secret access key</strong> when you are&nbsp;finished.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-s3-bucket"><a href="#create-a-new-s3-bucket" aria-label="create a new s3 bucket permalink"></a>Create a new S3&nbsp;bucket</h3>
<p>In the <strong>AWS Management Console</strong> go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new S3 bucket with a unique&nbsp;name.</li>
<li>Tag the bucket to track&nbsp;costs.</li>
<li>Allow public access by&nbsp;un-checking <strong><em>Block all public&nbsp;access</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Check <strong><em>Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists&nbsp;(ACLs)</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Check <strong><em>Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists&nbsp;(ACLs)</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enable-the-s3-bucket-for-static-website-hosting"><a href="#enable-the-s3-bucket-for-static-website-hosting" aria-label="enable the s3 bucket for static website hosting permalink"></a>Enable the S3 bucket for static website&nbsp;hosting</h3>
<p>After creating the bucket we need to enable&nbsp;the <strong>Static website hosting</strong> feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the newly created bucket&nbsp;name.</li>
<li>Go to&nbsp;the <strong><em>Properties Tab</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Then enable <strong><em>Static website hosting</em></strong> and&nbsp;choose <strong><em>Use this bucket to host a&nbsp;website</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter <strong><em>index.html</em></strong> for the Index&nbsp;document.</li>
<li>Enter <strong><em>404.html</em></strong> for the Error&nbsp;document.</li>
<li>Save your changes and make a note of&nbsp;the <strong>endpoint</strong>, you can use this address to test your site after your first deployment. If you visit the URL now, you should see&nbsp;a <strong>403 Forbidden</strong> page</li>
</ul>
<p>You can review this document for additional information&nbsp;about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/EnableWebsiteHosting.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hosting static sites on Amazon&nbsp;S3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-permissions-on-the-new-s3-bucket"><a href="#set-permissions-on-the-new-s3-bucket" aria-label="set permissions on the new s3 bucket permalink"></a>Set permissions on the new S3&nbsp;bucket</h3>
<p>To enable public access to the S3 bucket we need to change the bucket&nbsp;policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to&nbsp;the <strong><em>permissions Tab</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure you have&nbsp;cleared <strong><em>Block all public&nbsp;access</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong><em>Bucket policy</em></strong> enter the following configuration JSON and&nbsp;exchange <strong>example-name</strong> under&nbsp;the <strong>Resource</strong> section to be the unique name of your S3&nbsp;bucket:</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span><span>{</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>Version</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>2012-10-17</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span></span>

<span><span><span>        ]</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    }]</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>After setting the above policy, if you revisit the S3 bucket endpoint URL, you should now see&nbsp;a <strong>404 Not Found</strong> page.</p>
<p>You can review this document for additional information&nbsp;about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Setting permissions for website&nbsp;access</a>.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-connect-gatsby-cloud-to-amazon-s3"><a href="#step-3-connect-gatsby-cloud-to-amazon-s3" aria-label="step 3 connect gatsby cloud to amazon s3 permalink"></a>Step 3: Connect Gatsby Cloud to Amazon&nbsp;S3</h2>
<p>Now we can go back to the Gatsby Cloud platform and connect the build to the newly created S3&nbsp;bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong><em>Site Settings &gt; Integrations &gt;&nbsp;Hosting</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Locate <strong><em>AWS S3 Integration</em></strong> in the list of Hosting integrations and&nbsp;click <strong><em>Connect</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your&nbsp;IAM <strong><em>Access Key ID</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your&nbsp;IAM <strong><em>Secret Access Key</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your&nbsp;S3 <strong><em>Bucket Name</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After pressing save, it will trigger a new deployment. If everything goes as expected, you should wait a few moments for the deployment to complete. Once complete you can now visit your S3 URL endpoint from earlier, and you should now see your Gatsby site deployed on the AWS bucket endpoint&nbsp;address.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-set-up-amazon-cloudfront-cdn"><a href="#step-4-set-up-amazon-cloudfront-cdn" aria-label="step 4 set up amazon cloudfront cdn permalink"></a>Step 4: Set up Amazon CloudFront&nbsp;CDN</h2>
<p>You will probably want also to set up AWS CloudFront, which is Amazon's content delivery network (CDN). There are two reasons for&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>The first reason is that S3 buckets can't be configured to serve content over HTTPS to custom domains because Amazon S3 uses an SSL wildcard&nbsp;certificate.</p>
<p>The second reason is that using a CDN to distribute your static assets means your site speed will be impressive from most countries, not just countries close to where you hosted the new S3 bucket. (The CloudFront network has 216 points of presence&nbsp;(PoPs)).</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-ssl-certificate-for-your-domain-name"><a href="#create-a-new-ssl-certificate-for-your-domain-name" aria-label="create a new ssl certificate for your domain name permalink"></a>Create a new SSL certificate for your domain&nbsp;name</h3>
<p>In the <strong>AWS Management Console</strong> go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS Certificate Manager&nbsp;(ACM)</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong><em>Request a certificate</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your <strong><em>Domain name</em></strong>, I&nbsp;entered <strong><em>michaelfasani.com</em></strong> and I entered&nbsp;an <strong><em>Additional name</em></strong> as <strong><em>www.michaelfasani.com</em></strong> (I read some people seem to be having various issues with HTTPS in this kind of S3 setup and I believe the problem is from not specifying the www address as an additional name. You should add all the subdomains you want to work&nbsp;with).</li>
<li>Then choose to validate the certificate with&nbsp;either <strong><em>DNS validation</em></strong> or <strong><em>Email validation</em></strong> and follow the next steps for either&nbsp;choice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-a-new-cloudfront-distribution"><a href="#create-a-new-cloudfront-distribution" aria-label="create a new cloudfront distribution permalink"></a>Create a new CloudFront&nbsp;distribution</h3>
<p>In the <strong>AWS Management Console</strong> go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon CloudFront</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong><em>Create Distribution</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong><em>Web</em></strong> and&nbsp;click <strong><em>Get Started</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Paste your S3 domain URL in&nbsp;the <strong><em>Origin Domain Name</em></strong>…</li></ul></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vue-next (Vue 3) has been out for a while. It is now under release candidate stage which means there won't be big changes on the open APIs. Good to see that Vue has already been stabilized and ready to waltz into our projects.</p><p>I have to say that Vue 2 is already amazing enough. But with Vue 3's new features, it's likely to upgrade our projects to an upper level. I guess the most thrilling feature in Vue 3 would be the composition APIs. Evan You himself mentioned that the composition APIs are inspired by the React hooks. Even though the two APIs hooks and compositions are a lot alike, but from the code base they are completely different. Let's not discuss which is better or promising because I don't really think either framework outraces another.</p><p>In all, it's so happy to see that Vue can also do what React does.

"Filters" is Deprecated(Removed)</a></h2><p>I think a lot of people think that <code>filters</code> is maybe an awesome feature of Vue.js. It indeed works well in Vue's template engine. (For example, data formatting / calculation etc).</p><p>Let's see how Vue 3 doc explains why <code>filters</code> is removed:</p><blockquote><p>While this seems like a convenience, it requires a custom syntax that breaks the assumption of expressions inside of curly braces being "just JavaScript," which has both learning and implementation costs.</p></blockquote><p>I believe it's nothing bad for development without the <code>filters</code>, even though it may cost you extra time on migrating to Vue 3. In my projects, the appearance of <code>filters</code> is pretty a rare case since I could replace such functionality with a <code>method</code> or <code>computed</code> easily. Because in my opinion, <code>method</code> / <code>computed</code> has higher readability than the <code>filters</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

		<p>Each time I have created an Android image I have found something new. Google Assistant and Android Auto were results of Nougat and Oreo, and the changes I found in Google Assistant were a result of Android Pie. Android 10 is no exception. While poking around the OS during the data generation period I found Google’s Digital Wellbeing app was tracking how many times I unlocked the test phone each day, which led me to ask “what else was it tracking?” As it turns out, quite a bit. I shared this information with Alexis Brignoni (more on that later) and got to work on some test data after I <a href="https://thebinaryhick.blog/2020/02/15/android-10-image-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created the Android 10 image</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Wellbeing is not new. It was introduced to the Pixel line in Android 9, and slowly rolled out to non-Pixel phones. While not present on every Android device, it is required on newer devices. As of September 3, 2019, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/google-now-requires-all-android-devices-to-have-a-digital-wellbeing-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google is requiring Digital Wellbeing-like capabilities on all phones that either launch with or upgrade to Android 9 or 10</a>. This is baked into the Google Mobile Services contract, so OEMs who want to use Google services and apps on their handsets will have to comply. Basically, this means while the specific Digital Wellbeing app is not required, tracking certain activities and making that information available to the user is, so it is possible OEMs may implement their own solutions in order to comply. However, it is more likely they will just use Digital Wellbeing. The point is that regardless of which option OEMs choose, the data will be there…somewhere, and in some fashion.</p>
<p>Google wants users to be able to make informed decisions about their digital well being. In order to do this, users need to know how much time they are spending on their phones and how they are using them. Sometimes examiners and investigators need to know that same information in order to make informed decisions during an investigation. Digital Wellbeing can help with both.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI_vzeKA_Zg&amp;list=PLfouvuAjspTo6pWGP7otkE6SZ3QQ0b-RD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Hyde</a> (@B1N2H3X), <a href="https://abrignoni.blogspot.com/2019/02/android-usagestats-xml-parser.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexis Brignoni</a> (@AlexisBrignoni), and <a href="https://www.swiftforensics.com/2020/01/usagestats-on-android-10-q.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yogesh Khatri</a> (@SwiftForensics) have done a lot of great work on Usage Stats in Android and how they can be used to track user activity. My hope for this blog post is that it takes their work one step further.</p>
<h2>Visually Speaking</h2>
<p>Digital Wellbeing is a dashboard for the usage data it collects, and it is fairly easy to navigate. It can be accessed from the Android Settings app. Figure 1 shows the landing page for the app.</p>

<p>The part that is of interest here is the top portion, “Your Digital Wellbeing tools.” As you can see the device is tracking the number of unlocks and the amount of notifications received (red box). You can also see the chart that shows the amount of time I spent on the phone at that particular point in the day; I took the screenshot early in the morning, so I had only been on the phone for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Tapping in the middle of the blue circle brings me to the page seen in Figure 2, which is tracking the amount of time I have been active on my screen. The area in the red box is a drop down menu. The other two choices are “Notifications Received” (Figure 3) and “Times Opened” (Figure 4).</p>

<p>At the bottom of Figures 2-4, you can see how the total amount of time breaks down for each app. Figure 4 is a bit misleading, though. The top of the screen is tracking the number of times the phone has been opened and the number of times each app has been opened is detailed at the bottom.</p>
<p>That’s it. This app has other capabilities, but from an investigative standpoint these are the ones to pay attention to.</p>
<h2>Forensically Speaking</h2>
<p>To generate test data, I wiped my Pixel 3, flashed it with a clean install of Android 10 (January 2020 patch level), and then rooted it with Magisk. When setting up the phone I took all of the defaults. I did not do anything to the Digital Wellbeing app just so I could see what the default data collection looked like, and I imagine most users will do the same as they probably do not care about this feature. I installed two apps from the Google Play Store, Line and WhatsApp, and generated some test data with them along with some default apps.</p>
<p>The best way to forensically describe Digital Wellbeing is “Usage Stats on steroids.” While this is great for Android, it is not quite as thorough as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mac4n6.com/blog/2018/8/5/knowledge-is-power-using-the-knowledgecdb-database-on-macos-and-ios-to-determine-precise-user-and-application-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS’s knowledgeC,</a>&nbsp;and it is definiately no where near as “clean” as knowledgeC. &nbsp;However, examining it is straight forward for two reasons: 1, it is a SQLite database, and 2, it uses the same event type codes as Usage Stats, which are <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageEvents.Event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well documented on the Android developer site</a>. In theory, one could merely extract the database, run a quick SQL query, export to CSV, and sort by time. Voila, you have yourself a timeline, right? Well, not quite.</p>
<p>Before we get to the database, let’s take a quick look at where it is stored. The Digital Wellbeing database is aptly named “<em>app_usage</em>” and is in the path <strong>/data/data/com.google.android.apps.wellbeing/databases</strong>. &nbsp;See Figure 5.</p>

<p>This table is simple. Here the timestamps can be seen (in Unix Epoch) along with the event codes for what the app did (column type). Again, these codes are the same as those in Usage Stats, but in Android 10 (API 29) two have been renamed, five new ones have been introduced, and one is not even documented. The codes I have observed in the table are as follows:</p>
<p>1 = ACTIVITY_RESUMED (Formerly MOVE_TO_FOREGROUND)<br>
2 = ACTIVITY_PAUSED (Formerly MOVE_TO_BACKGROUND)<br>
12 = Notification (not documented on the Android Developer site)<br>
18 = KEYGUARD_HIDDEN (indicative of a device unlock-added in Android 9)<br>
19 = FOREGROUND_SERVICE_START (new)<br>
20 = FORGROUND_SERVICE_STOP (new)<br>
23 = ACTIVITY_STOPPED (new)<br>
26 = DEVICE_SHUTDOWN (new)<br>
27 = DEVICE_STARTUP (new)</p>
<p>Some of the names are descriptive enough, but for those that are not you can read about them by visiting the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageEvents.Event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Developers page</a>.</p>
<p>The values in the column <em>package_id</em> refer to the values <em>_id</em> in the table <strong>packages</strong> (Figure 7).</p>

<p>To help decipher this, I have color coded some lines. The orange rows indicate when my device locked, with the package ending in “nexuslauncher” stopping (activity type 23). The next event that shows up is just over two hours later (green rows). In the next two rows (green) you can see nexuslauncher resume (activity type 1), and then the package android appears with the activity type 18 (device unlock). I had locked the phone at 13:32, and then woke it at 15:40 and unlocked it.</p>
<p>The next thing I did a minute later was change the wallpaper. I long-pressed on the home screen and went to the wallpaper gallery. You can see that nexuslauncher paused and then stopped (yellow rows) and then the package ending in “wallpaper” resumed-paused-stopped-resumed (cycled), which is shown in the blue rows. Once I chose my wallpaper I went back to the homescreen (white row), and then the wallpaper package stopped (red rows) since I was done with it.</p>
<p>Looking at the <em>Human Readable Time</em> column you will see that this entire series of actions occur within a minute and a half of each other, and some of those occur at the same second. In that case the sorting is done by the column “<em>_id</em>.” Interestingly enough, I did not find where the values in the <em>_id</em> column were not in chronological order. Not to say that it could not happen, but that I did not find it.</p>
<p>Figure 10 is my next example.</p>

<p>In this figure I had been using the Android Messages app (orange row), and hit the home button to go back to the home screen (blue boxes). I left the phone alone and let the screen timeout on its own (timeout setting was 5 minutes). The phone sat dormant until I unlocked it which took me to the home screen (green rows). I then opened the Line app and started typing (yellow and grey rows).</p>
<p>The red rows are interesting. They all have event ID’s of 12, and they were all written to the database while I was not using the phone (I had left it on my desk with no interaction for over a day). I went back and checked my notes and compared them and this output versus what was in the Digital Wellbeing Notifications dashboard, and, as it turns out, event ID 12 denotes a notification. The thing to note is it could be a notification you can see or <em>cannot</em> see. For example, I had numerous entries for <strong>com.android.providers.downloads</strong>, however, I have nothing in my notes that indicate I received a notification for that. It is possible Google Play Store downloaded updates in the background and I never saw them (remember I took the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Cloud accounts are usually seen as machinery, humming away 24/7, working all the time to fulfill a business need. This is certainly true for production applications, but most workloads are not like this. A developer goes to an office in the morning, works until late afternoon then goes home. When he is not working, the account just sits there, doing practically nothing.</p> <p>And this happens for longer periods of time too. Someone might be working on a project then moves to another one just to come back to the first one months later.</p> <p>The problem is that these inactive accounts still have all the power of a normal account, and they significantly increase the attack surface. It doesn’t matter if an account is unused for months if a misplaced access key leads that it starts mining Bitcoin.</p> <p>It would be better to inactivate AWS accounts when they are not needed. Fortunately, it is possible with service control policies.</p> <div> <div> <div> <p><small>Shameless plug</small></p><div> <div> <p><img sizes="150px" integrity="sha256-WQF8nZ8/5i9yYsT55IpUy24SgBvH65jOuQBt+1zNP0U=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/80fbfe-405b6a9c03d36452d3900d73fd4bda5868a74e5997d190c09b4d1ef96a0e1ddb.png" srcset="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/27de8a-405b6a9c03d36452d3900d73fd4bda5868a74e5997d190c09b4d1ef96a0e1ddb.png 150w, https://advancedweb.hu/assets/3c3744-88dfc30ea21c62fec449c6f3b6d2c746617af8536ccc421cdcc69c024b28e85f.png 300w, https://advancedweb.hu/assets/fbbfcc-d33b95f6785dadb8457af3ba54ac043b360b3e81778b529c8756539679d35b71.png 450w, https://advancedweb.hu/assets/cbbc51-8341d403719fee0fe6444294a0270a6ac14dd5288422fe3f237d7b11af9b77bc.png 225w"> </p> <p> <h5>Join our mailing list and get a free guide of 5 tips to make an AWS account more secure</h5> </p> <!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->  <!--End mc_embed_signup--> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="scp">SCP</h2> <p>Service control policies (SCPs) <strong>allow outside control over the account</strong>. Because of this, this is the most powerful policy type in AWS as there is no way around them, even the root user is limited. When an SCP is in place there is no way to remove it or negate its effect without accessing the master account.</p> <p>The SCP is a feature of AWS Organizations which is the service that allows creating multiple accounts without going through the usual process of registration. With Organizations, you can create a new account programmatically and it allows managing hundreds and thousands of accounts.</p> <p>The account that has billing information filled in is called the <em>master account</em>. This is the one you created the traditional way and charges your bank card. The accounts created using Organizations are called <em>member accounts</em>. These are dependent on the master account for billing.</p> <p>Organizations allow the master account to attach SCPs to member accounts to limit what they can do. These are IAM policies that are evaluated before anything else in the policy evaluation logic. With SCPs an account can be limited in which regions it can use resources, what services it can use, and even what resources it can not delete or modify.</p> <p>Without access to the master account these policies can not be changed or removed. This makes SCPs a great tool to enforce limitations in an account. The master account can not be limited by an SCP.</p> <h2 id="lockdown-policy">Lockdown policy</h2> <p>To prevent an account from being used an SCP that denies everything can be used:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

Using the <em>master account</em>, use this call:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws organizations attach-policy <span>--target-id</span> &lt;account <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>--policy-id</span> &lt;policy <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This attaches the policy and that prevents anything from happening inside the account. No new instances can be run, no information can be queried about any resource inside it, even Lambda functions that are already added won’t work. Here is how the IAM console looks like with an admin account:</p> <p><img integrity="sha256-lfXU2SbYtvswrUw8NOlQzMbS6kibv7LP61PRxeSIGSM=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/lock_account_with_scp/iam-95f5d4d926d8b6fb30ad4c3c34e950ccc6d2ea489bbfb2cfeb53d1c5e4881923.png"></p> <p>And the best thing is that these restrictions also apply to the root user. In practice, as long as this policy is attached the account is unusable in any ways.</p> <h3 id="unlock">Unlock</h3> <p>To unlock the account and get back to normal all you need to do is detach the policy with the master account:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws organizations detach-policy <span>--target-id</span> &lt;account <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>--policy-id</span> &lt;policy <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="auto-unlock-and-lock-script">Auto unlock and lock script</h2> <p>Let’s bring this a step further! With some scripting it is possible to unlock the account for a shell session and auto-lock it when the session ends. Effectively, this setup minimizes the time the account is usable to when it’s needed which is perfect for a development account.</p> <p>Here’s a simple script to achieve that:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws organizations detach-policy <span>--target-id</span> <span>$ACCOUNTID</span> <span>--policy-id</span> <span>$POLICYID</span> <span>||</span> <span>true

</span><span>AWS_PROFILE</span><span>=</span>sandbox <span>AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG</span><span>=</span>1 zsh

aws organizations attach-policy <span>--target-id</span> <span>$ACCOUNTID</span> <span>--policy-id</span> <span>$POLICYID</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It unlocks the account then starts <code>zsh</code>. When the shell finishes by typing <code>exit</code>, the account gets locked automatically. Furthermore, it sets the <code>AWS_PROFILE</code> environment variable so that AWS CLI calls inside the shell session go to the member account. The <code>AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG</code> is needed for the AWS SDK to support the profile setting.</p> <p>A corresponding profile can be configured for the AWS CLI:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>[profile sandbox]</span>
<span>role_arn</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;role arn&gt;</span>
<span>source_profile</span><span>=</span><span>default</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The above setting works when you have a user specified in the credentials file. But in my case it used the <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code>, the <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>, and the <code>AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</code> environment variables and this setup does not play well with profiles. When both the keys and the profile is set in the environment the former takes precedence and that prevents the jump into the account.</p> <p>The solution is to create a temporary credentials file and unset the keys from the environment:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>CRED_FILE</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>mktemp</span><span>)</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"[default]</span><span>\n</span><span>aws_access_key_id=</span><span>$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>\n</span><span>aws_secret_access_key=</span><span>$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>\n</span><span>aws_session_token=</span><span>$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$CRED_FILE</span>

aws organizations detach-policy <span>--target-id</span> <span>$ACCOUNTID</span> <span>--policy-id</span> <span>$POLICYID</span> <span>||</span> <span>true</span>

<span>(</span>
	<span>unset </span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

Since steel’s decline more than 30 years ago, the Mon Valley community has suffered from chronic disinvestment.</p>  <p>“When you look at what changed, it was the community aspect of it. It’s like, let’s get back to relying on one another and building up ourselves,” Reyes says as traffic rolls through Braddock’s commercial district, a sparse collection of businesses scattered among empty storefronts and vacant lots.</p>  <p>Reyes is the director of Neighbors Helping Neighbors, a grassroots group that links volunteers with people who need services such as a car ride or home repair. The goal, Reyes says, is to establish an “alternative economy.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg" alt="As director of the grassroots group Neighbors Helping Neighbors, Jona Reyes has helped to build a network of about 200 residents who can offer and solicit services such as car rides or home repairs.

About five years ago, involveMINT developed a digital currency, called “time credits,” to share with people who invest their time in the community. The East Liberty-based venture initially focused its efforts in Pittsburgh’s Hazelwood neighborhood. But by working with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, the group hopes to begin circulating time credits in and around Braddock.</p>  <p>So far, involveMINT and Neighbors Helping Neighbors have enlisted about 10 local businesses to accept the credits as payment. While the units <a href="https://www.theselc.org/community-currencies-faq">are considered taxable earnings</a>, they reflect a deeper contribution to the community, said involveMINT executive director Dan Little.</p>  <p>“Money is scarce in the communities that arguably would need it most,”&nbsp; Little noted of the lack of funding in places like Braddock. “So the idea is [that] by having an alternative currency, you’re creating an alternative channel for commerce to happen, when that money is not available.”</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg" alt="Dan Little, executive director of involveMINT, began to develop time credits as an alternative form of currency in 2015.

The idea <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2006/02/11/local-currencies-ithaca_cz_el_money06_0214local.html#eb379bf5b4cd">grew especially popular during the Great Depression</a>, when market failures dried up the supply of cash in circulation. Propronents say alternative currencies help to stimulate local economies by encouraging firms and residents to do business with others who participate in their community's homegrown currency system.</p>  <p>Little added that COVID-19, and the economic turmoil it has caused, further underscore the value of reducing communities’ reliance on dollars.</p>  <p>Although the federal government has <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center#eligibility">distributed coronavirus stimulus payments to qualifying households</a>, Little noted, “for many people, that barely covers rent … And with local businesses, we know that they have seen a tremendous decrease in revenue.”</p>  <p>By using time credits created, or minted, by involveMINT, Little said, businesses can establish a new source of revenue, and use those funds to buy more supplies locally. Little noted that the coronavirus pandemic has revealed the fragility of global supply chains.</p>  <p>“[The new currency] may not be a panacea. It’s not going to pay for everything. But it’s going to get [users] some access to things that are local,” Little said.</p>  <p><strong>‘It will help to unify the community’</strong></p>  <p>COVID-19 prompted Neighbors Helping Neighbors and involveMINT to launch a grocery delivery service as one option for earning time credits. The program aims to help those who are vulnerable to the disease and, thus, should avoid stores.</p>  <p>Retiree Cynthia Underwood is one of several community members who have signed up to make deliveries. Her clients include seniors such as Myrtle Walker, who’s physically unable to go down stairs. In fact, when Underwood makes a delivery, the 72-year-old drops a key from her second-floor apartment window so that Underwood can let herself in.</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg" alt="Braddock resident Myrtle Walker relies on an oxygen generator to manage her lung disease.

Grow Pittsburgh’s director of farm education, Denele Hughson, said time credits are rooted in the same philosophy as her organization, which strives to empower communities like Braddock to draw on existing assets to cultivate their own food economies.</p>  <p>Hughson noted that her organization can use the time credits to buy compost from the local company Worm Return. And she said Grow Pittsburgh will use the units to pay for a few additional hours of work at its urban farm.</p>  <p>“Someone who’s just looking to volunteer for a few hours a week, and in exchange for that they actually get something tangible that they can use it on&nbsp;– I think that would be amazing,” Hughson said.</p>  <p><strong>‘Funny money?’</strong></p> <p>The success of any currency, including the dollar, depends on whether people trust it. And whether they trust it depends on how much they see others use it.</p>  <p>Circulation has been a challenge for local currencies elsewhere. In Ithaca, N.Y., for example, a currency called Ithaca HOURS went defunct after about two decades. Erik Lehmann was the last person to chair the Ithaca HOURS board.</p>  <p>“Towards the end, it was basically like a coupon,” he said of the HOURS. “It wasn’t a full currency. Most vendors that accepted it didn’t accept it at full face value.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg" alt="Grow Pittsburgh is one of about 10 local organizations that have agreed to accept time credits as payment.

While at one time about 300 businesses had signed up to accept the HOURS, Lehamann said, “There weren’t the Wegman’s and the big banks and the big landlords."</p>  <p>In Philadelphia, a local currency called Equal Dollars <a href="https://generocity.org/philly/2014/07/14/equal-dollars-alternative-currency-out-of-circulation-after-19-years/">faced a similar hurdle</a>, though it too had been in circulation for about 20 years. Former Equal Dollars director Deneene Brockington said, because most businesses had nowhere to spend Equal Dollars, they simply donated them to charities of their choosing.</p>  <p>“That kind of resonated with some people and some local businesses: They got to participate in something local and then donate to a community organization that then was able to use those dollars as a way to thank their people for community service,” Brockington said.</p>  <p>Equal Dollars ultimately dissolved in 2014 because, Brockington said, the nonprofit that ran it, Resources for Human Development, decided to stop funding the program. Brockington noted that staffers like her, who managed the Equal Dollars program, still needed to be paid in U.S. dollars. After all, they couldn't use alternative currency to pay their bills.</p>  <p>Scott Morris, who is leading an effort to launch a new currency in Ithaca, called Ithacash, has also struggled to secure funding for personnel. He said it's a necessary expense, to ensure that professionals can educate people and businesses on how to use the units, recruit more participants into the network, and manage the complexities associated with sustaining that network.</p>  <p>"The business model has never been easy to deal with because it’s like, ‘Look, we’re making our own money, and so you should pay us some regular money for it.’ And [potential funders] are just going to be like, ‘Well, this is the real money. Why do you want my real money for your funny money?’” Morris said.</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg" alt="Neighbors Helping Neighbors and involveMINT receive some donations for their grocery delivery service from Dorothy Gey's food distribution site in Braddock.

It’s like … let’s see what the community can do to help itself.”</p> </div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>#100DaysOfCode</code> is a great engagement to refresh some of the concepts that are basic, but extremely important.  Today, I spent time on refreshing my memory on JavaScript's equality operators and methods. Thought, why not to write about it?</p>
<p>Traditionally JavaScript provides 2 special operators for equality comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> for Abstract Equality Comparison which performs a loose equality between the operands.</li>
<li><code>===</code> for Strict Equality Comparison which performs a strict equality between the operands.</li>
</ul>
<p>With ES6, we have one more way to perform the <code>Same-value equality</code> using <code>Object.is</code> method. In this article, we will get deeper in understanding the usage, impact and use-cases of all of them.</p>

<p>Abstract equality comparison(aka, loose equality comparison) compares two values for equality, after converting both the values into a common type. In this type of comparison, <code>type coercion</code> is performed by JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us understand this with an example. Consider two different animals from the type Rodent, i.e, hamsters and guinea pigs. I have no doubts that, the equality comparison with <code>==</code> is going to return <code>true</code> by coercing their type to rodent.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597131508222/pQgOeyb0E.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>In programming,</p>
<pre><code><span>true</span> == <span>1</span> 
<span>'0'</span> == <span>0</span> 
[<span>9</span>, <span>2</span>] == <span>'9,2'</span> 
<span>""</span> == <span>0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>You would find the <code>==</code> operator strange, if you are new to the JavaScript and holding your experiences of value comparisons from another programming language. </p>
<p>That's not all. The <code>==</code> operator also has an evil sister called, <code>!=</code>. It does just the opposite comparison of two values to check if they are not equal. However, just like <code>==</code>, it also does a type conversion which leads to confusions.</p>

<p>With strict equality comparison, guinea pigs and hamsters are not equal as, <code>===</code> compares two values for equality. Neither of the values are implicitly converted(coerced) to some other value before being compared. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Strict Equality Comparison, If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code><span>true</span> === <span>1</span> 
<span>'0'</span> === <span>0</span> 
[<span>9</span>, <span>2</span>] === <span>'9,2'</span> 
<span>""</span> === <span>0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>===</code> also has an angel sister called, <code>!==</code> which helps in finding if two values are strictly not equal. We should be using the strict type(<code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>) comparison over the loose type(<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>) comparison <strong>almost</strong> always. </p>
<p>But why almost? Why not always?</p>
<p>The <code>===</code> handles <code>NaN</code>, <code>-0</code>, and <code>+0</code> bit differently.</p>
<pre><code><span>NaN</span> === <span>NaN</span> 
+<span>0</span> === <span>-0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Strict equality treats <code>NaN</code> as unequal to every other value, including itself. It also doesn't care about the difference between +0 and -0. Now for some situations, these differences may matter and the strict equality may fail there.</p>

<p>With ES6, we have a new way to determine if the two values are same.</p>
<pre><code><span>Object</span>.is(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>null</span>, <span>null</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>undefined</span>, <span>undefined</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>true</span>, <span>1</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(+<span>0</span>, <span>-0</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>NaN</span>, <span>NaN</span>) 
</code></pre>
<p>From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is">MDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two values are the same if one of the following holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>both undefined</li>
<li>both null<ul>
<li>both true or both false</li>
<li>both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order</li>
<li>both the same object (means both object have same reference)</li>
<li>both numbers and</li>
<li>both <code>+0</code></li>
<li>both <code>-0</code></li>
<li>both <code>NaN</code></li>
<li>or both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us try answering couple of questions based on the concepts we have learned so far,</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-think-the-output-is-false-in-all-the-cases-">Why do you think, the output is <code>false</code> in all the cases?</h3>
<pre><code><span>let</span> obj1 = {name: <span>'GreenRoots'</span>};
<span>let</span> obj2 = {name: <span>'GreenRoots'</span>};

obj1 == obj2 
obj1 === obj2 
<span>Object</span>.is(obj1, obj2); 
</code></pre>
<p>It is because, JavaScript has five primitive data types that are <code>passed by value</code>: Boolean, String, Number, null, and undefined.</p>
<p>Rest of the data types are called non-primitives and those are mostly Objects(yes, including Array, Function and Object itself). These non-primitives types are <code>passed by reference</code>.</p>
<p>Hence both obj1 and obj2 above holds the value as the different memory locations that they are created on. Hence the comparison will be <code>false</code> always.</p>
<p>Here is an article that shows the Object reference concepts visual way,</p>

<h3 id="do-you-think-the-object-is-comparison-result-really-matters-over-">Do you think the <code>Object.is</code> comparison result really matters over <code>===</code>?</h3>
<p>Yes it does. React uses <code>Object.is</code> algorithm to compare the state.  Find a great explanation of it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/swlh/using-es6-map-with-react-state-hooks-800b91eedd5f">in this article</a> by Avinash Ega.</p>

<p>Here is a comparison chart with sample values compared using, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code> and <code>Object.is</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Achievement gap is a major problem plaguing education systems in America. It refers to the disparity in academic performance or educational attainment between different groups of students based on socioeconomic status, race, or gender.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a clear difference in schooling and learning opportunities for students based on wealth. There is even a term known as “90-10 gap” – so called because it compares students in the 90th and 10th percentiles of family wealth – and it equals about a 4-year difference in learning (Reardon, 2011).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although efforts are being made to bridge the gap at national and local levels, children from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds are still falling behind their peers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunately, education technology is helping to close the achievement gap by becoming an ally to teachers. This is not just a gut instinct either – <a href="https://www.thetechedvocate.org/can-digital-equity-close-achievement-gap/">research from Standford University</a> has found that technology can help boost test scores for low-income students when used correctly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post is going to look at exactly how Edtech can play a significant role in closing the achievement gap in America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Using Edtech the right way – to complement class learning</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology in the classroom is not a cure-all in itself, its value lies in the way it is used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Low-income schools typically use technology in a “drill and kill” approach, where students are presented with the information they are expected to memorize and are later tested on. The results of this kind of approach are less than favorable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology is not a replacement for good old classroom tutoring. However, combining technology with teacher training can prove to be very effective.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a case in point, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858416673968">two-year study</a> was conducted in Maine to find the efficiency of using an online homework tool along with classroom learning for seventh graders. The results showed that end-of-year standardized test results were boosted 80% over the anticipated performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, students who were below the median on the previous year’s state math test gained the equivalent of over two years of learning in a single year. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Self-paced Edtech is good, but it’s better in the hands of the teachers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Self-paced education technology can be great for students. However, it can actually make the achievement gap worse, because typically high-performing students progress quickly while underperforming students are left behind, as found by a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2013-31551-001/">Duke University study</a>. This is simply counterproductive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A better way to improve results and close the achievement gap is to give teachers effective Edtech tools that empower them to better focus their time and resources. This will allow them to give more attention to students that need more help, which will then make self-paced learning more positive for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Edtech is most effective when it aligns to curriculum</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the biggest concerns among teachers regarding Edtech tools is that often they don’t align with the curriculum set by their school district. So even if the tool is a good learning companion, it is not preparing students for what ultimately matters: the standards tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What teachers need to look out for are Edtech tools that are created with this in mind. Georgia Test Prep is a tool specifically designed to be aligned with <a href="https://georgiatestprep.com/">Georgia school curriculums</a>. It is made in Georgia, by Georgia teachers, especially for Georgia students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While currently Georgia Test Prep is aimed towards parents, we are in the process of developing a solution specifically for the teachers of Georgia that will help them support their students to greatly improve their math and ELA Skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Edtech can make life easier for teachers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teachers have their plates full at all times. Further burdening them with having to check assessment tests in the digital age is completely unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edtech solutions can reduce teacher workload with automated marking and sophisticated reporting. They can help lift the burden of these administrative tasks, thereby freeing up more of their time to spend with their students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember, the results of an Edtech tool for underprivileged students is only as good as the teacher training they receive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The achievement gap in America today is the result of a complex set of multiple factors, and it isn’t going to be bridged overnight. But educators are taking steps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edtech providers are helping in this process too. What they need to do next is to listen to school districts to understand their pain points and curriculum requirements, and modify their offering to cater to individual school district demands. They may need to pay particular attention to the needs of low-income students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edtech has a lot of potential in the digital age to help students from all socioeconomic backgrounds get the help they need to excel. It will take the right application of Edtech to release that potential.</p>

However, it’s easy to be trapped by <a href="https://zepel.io/features/sprints/">sprints</a> and <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/daily-scrum-standup/">daily standup meetings</a>, and assume that your team is agile.</p><p>A siloed organization looks a lot like this:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png" alt="Example structure of siloed teams in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 2064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example structure of how siloed teams look like</figcaption></figure><p>For most teams, a siloed structure consists of:</p><ul><li>a dedicate team for the app that involves building all the customer-facing functionalities,</li><li>an operations team that’s responsible for infrastructure and security, and sometimes</li><li>internal tools team that builds special tools for internal use.</li></ul><p><strong>The common problems you’ll encounter in this type of team structure are:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>App team vs Operations team:</strong> Both teams can end up becoming frustrated when server allocation becomes a bottleneck for deployment. This is especially common in a fast-growing organization with high customer demand and tight deadlines.<br></li><li><strong>Language barriers:</strong> This can often be seen between all the teams especially if one of them uses a specific language that the other can’t ingest easily. Too much time gets spent on trivial problems and forces teams to employ “<em>workarounds</em>” too often.<br></li><li><strong>Nobody is held accountable for tech debts:</strong> The app team continues to build features as the product manager prioritizes them based on customer requests. But very little importance is given to tech debts and bugs. This hinders the progress of the overall business as the end customer’s experience gets impacted.</li></ol><p><strong>What is the root cause for the problems in a siloed agile team?</strong></p><p>If you look at any organization that has a siloed team structure, you’ll notice the team has a departmental structure. They usually have a set of rigid responsibilities that doesn’t leave any room for cross-functional collaboration.</p><p>This rigid departmental structure can lead to incomplete infrastructure, a steady stream of bugs reported by customers, and functionality gaps that each team thought the other was working on.</p><p>Once your team notices all these problems, they’ll be under immense pressure to perform as quickly as possible because the reported bugs never seem to end. This desire to hit due dates will lead to fewer risks being taken.</p><hr><h2 id="team-structure-2-matrix-teams">Team Structure #2: Matrix Teams</h2><p>As a result of trying to improve the siloed structure, teams end up with a matrix-like team structure.</p><p>This is how a matrix agile team structure looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png" alt="Example of matrix team structure in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1042w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of matrix team structure in agile software development</figcaption></figure><p>This agile teams structure includes:</p><ul><li>Multiple product teams, each with web developers, backend engineers, UI and UX person, and a scrum master.</li><li>A maintenance team that takes ownership of all services in production and ensured all bugs get squished as they came up.</li><li>An operations team that handles all infrastructure related requests.</li></ul><p>In first glance, you’d think this is a step in the right direction. After all, it solves the majority of the problems a siloed team had.</p><p>There’s a separate team in place that takes ownership of all the debts, product teams can move quickly and ship features faster, and developers worked close to each other with shared goals.</p><p><strong>However, there are still some hidden issues you’ll run into with this team structure.</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Getting maintenance team charged up and rally around a common goal becomes harder</strong>. At the end of the day, nobody wants their entire job to be just about the maintenance of someone else’s work.<br></li><li>Since the maintenance team worked on someone else’s work, they will first <strong>have to identify whose work they are fixing</strong> in case they needed help trying to understand the code.<br></li><li>Since everything falls on the maintenance teams in terms of maintaining quality and fixing bugs, it can lead to a <strong>lack of ownership of the quality of code within the product teams</strong>.<br></li><li>With several product teams cranking out one feature after another, <strong>the burden on a single operations team is high</strong>. If not handled carefully, this can lead to infrastructure shortages and higher wait times for product teams to ship.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="team-structure-3-squads-tribes">Team Structure #3: Squads &amp; Tribes</h2><p>You’ve probably heard of the squads and tribe team structure after it was popularized by the folks at Spotify.</p><p>For context, a squad is a group of cross-functional people working together on common product functionality and have one long-term mission. A tribe is a group of squads. If you haven't already, check out their in-depth video about this <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/">over here</a>.</p><p>Here’s how it looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png" alt="Example of Spotify's Squad + Tribe team structure in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 1327w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of Spotify's Squad + Tribe team structure in agile software development</figcaption></figure><p>This model enables each squad and tribe to own their roadmap, their code, and their development process. <strong>Here are some advantages of this model over the others:</strong></p><ul><li>It removes the dependency and the need for a maintenance team. Each squad owns their code from feature request to build, deploy, and bug fixes.</li><li>The need for reporting to multiple members is removed since every member works in close proximity to each other with shared goals.</li><li>The role of operations squad is to enable the squads with relevant tools to self-serve and self-deploy. This allows the teams to ship often and make it a routine.</li><li>Infrastructure alerts and needs can be handled by relevant squads themselves since they’re equipped with all the knowledge already and can resolve issues faster.</li></ul><p>Like a scrum team, this model is focussed on being self-organized. This exposes the major disadvantage with this structure — it assumes collaboration as a core competency in members with little to no oversight.</p><p>Besides, when you don’t give it enough thought and consideration, the Spotify model can quickly become the matrix structure with members reporting to multiple people.</p><hr><h2 id="learning-from-the-mistakes-of-other-agile-team-structures">Learning from the mistakes of other agile team structures</h2><p>Of course, there is no silver bullet. However, you can follow some key principles when it comes to building an agile team and putting together a team structure.</p><p><strong>1. Remove or minimize dependencies between teams</strong></p><p>The more dependencies you have between teams, the more processes you’ll have put in place. The can lead to increased wait times, missed deadlines, and frustrations.</p><p>If you begin to see an increase in dependencies between two teams working on critical functions, you should try to empower the team with tools or even consider combining the teams into a squad or a tribe.</p><p><strong>2. Optimize for understanding instead of processes</strong></p><p>When things go sideways or “<em>it doesn’t feel right</em>”, most teams look to impose rigid processes and optimize every interaction. This comes from the assumption that everyone is an expert when it comes to collaboration.</p><p>Instead, it’s better to optimize for understanding. Every person has a unique way of working and grasp information at different levels. Enabling your team to understand all the information at their disposal and the goal needed to achieve can help your team deliver a higher quality of work.</p><p><strong>3. Alignment is essential if you want to give autonomy</strong></p><p>Every team wants autonomy to work the way they want to. It promotes creativity and enables them to do better work. However, autonomy requires greater alignment towards the priorities. And it requires accountability to delivering value in short increments.</p><p><strong>4. Loosely define roles, but hold them accountable to a goal</strong></p><p>The first instinct for growing teams is to define strict roles &amp; responsibilities. It starts with the goal of holding each member accountable.</p><p>Instead of defining strict roles, define them loosely. Often, strict definition brings rigidity and narrows down the team’s focus on one solution. By loosely defining the role, but holding them accountable, it brings flexibility into how they approach problems. And it can lead to long-term wins.</p><hr><p>Forming an agile software development team structure is hard. Your could be using any <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/">free kanban software</a> or the most <a href="https://zepel.io/solutions/scrum/">sophisticated scrum tool</a>. But without the right team structure that brings together the strengths of your teammates, you'll always end up saying “<em>it doesn't feel right</em>”.</p><p>Of course, you can’t get it right in one shot. You’ll have to experiment a bit, make a few mistakes, and learn a little extra about your team along the way.</p><p>If you’ve been doing this for some time and you’d like to share your knowledge, tweet to us <a href="https://twitter.com/getzepel/">@GetZepel</a>. We’d love to hear your approach!</p>

<p>This JavaScript demo application visualizes in detailed steps, how a text string is encoded into a QR Code barcode symbol. The content of this page essentially explains and justifies how my <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library">QR Code generator library</a> works internally.</p>

<h2>User input</h2>


<h2>QR Code output</h2>

<h2>Step-by-step process</h2>
<p id="show-hide-steps">Show/hide each step: </p>
<section>
	<h3>0. Analyze Unicode characters</h3>
	<p>Number of code points in the input text string: <span id="num-code-points"></span></p>
	<p>Details of each character:</p>
	<table id="character-analysis">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th><abbr title="Index in input string">Index</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="The character itself">Char</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Unicode code point value in hexadecimal">CP hex</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in numeric mode">NM</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in alphanumeric mode">AM</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in byte mode">BM</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in kanji mode">KM</abbr></th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Can every character be encoded in:</p>
	<table id="character-mode-summary">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Mode</th>
				<th>Encodable</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Chosen segment mode to encode all characters: <span id="chosen-segment-mode"></span></p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>1. Create data segment</h3>
	<p>Convert each character to bits. For numeric and alphanumeric modes, consecutive characters are grouped together before being encoded into bits. For byte mode, a character produces either 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits.</p>
	<table id="data-segment-chars">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Index</th>
				<th>Char</th>
				<th>Values (hex)</th>
				<th>Value</th>
				<th>Combined</th>
				<th>Bits</th>
			</tr>

	<p>The created single segment:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mode: <span id="segment-mode"></span></li>
		<li>Count: <span id="segment-count"></span></li>
		<li>Data: <span id="segment-data"></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>(This demo program always creates a single segment for simplicity. But it is possible to <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/optimal-text-segmentation-for-qr-codes">segment the text optimally</a> to minimize the total bit length.)</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>2. Fit to version number</h3>
	<p>Total bit length needed to represent the list of segments, depending on version:</p>
	<table id="segment-size">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Range</th>
				<th>Num bits</th>
				<th>Num codewords</th>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Version 27 ~ 40</td>

	</table>
	<p>(Note: A codeword is defined as 8 bits, also known as a byte.)</p>
	<p>QR Code capacity of data codewords per version and error correction level, and whether the data fits:</p>
	<table id="codewords-per-version">

		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Chosen version number: <span id="chosen-version"></span></p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>3. Concatenate segments, add padding, make codewords</h3>
	<p>Join a variety of bit strings together:</p>
	<table id="segment-and-padding-bits">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Item</th>
				<th>Bit data</th>
				<th><abbr title="Number of">Num</abbr> bits</th>
				<th><abbr title="Cumulative number of">Sum</abbr> bits</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The segment mode is always a 4-bit field.</p></li>
		<li><p>The character count’s field width depends on the mode and version.</p></li>
		<li><p>The terminator is normally four “0” bits, but fewer if the data codeword capacity is reached.</p></li>
		<li><p>The bit padding is between zero to seven “0” bits, to fill all unused bits in the last byte.</p></li>
		<li><p>The byte padding consists of alternating hex <span>EC</span> and <span>11</span> until the capacity is reached.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p id="full-bitstream">The entire sequence of data bits: <span></span></p>
	<p>The entire sequence of data codeword bytes (by splitting the bit stream 8 bits at a time) (displayed in hexadecimal): <span id="all-data-codewords"></span></p>

	<h3>4. Split blocks, add ECC, interleave</h3>
	<p>Statistics about all blocks:</p>
	<table id="block-stats">
		<tbody>
			<tr><td>Number of data codewords:      </td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>Number of blocks:              </td><td></td></tr>

			<tr><td>Number of short blocks:        </td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>Number of long blocks:         </td><td></td></tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Split the sequence of data codewords (green) into short and long blocks; then for each block, compute the ECC codewords (blue) and append them to the end of the block:</p>
	<table id="blocks-and-ecc">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th rowspan="2" colspan="2"></th>
				<th>Block index</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>(Note: The math behind computing the Reed-Solomon error correction codes is omitted because it is long, tedious, and not very interesting.)</p>
	<p>The final sequence of codewords formed by interleaving data/ECC codewords from different blocks: <span id="interleaved-codewords"></span></p>
	<p id="final-bit-sequence">The final sequence of bits to draw in the zig-zag scan: <span></span></p>

	<h3>6. Draw codewords and remainder</h3>
	<p>Compute the zig-zag scan (which starts from the bottom right corner) to visit all unfilled modules (i.e. skipping function modules):</p>
	<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" id="zig-zag-scan"></svg>

<p>If you are someone like me who spends hours and hours a day typing then you
might be interested in investing in learning how to properly type, more
precisely on learning how to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>.
My story begins 2 years ago when I saw one person typing so fluently and elegantly with almost no effort, focusing on
the result and not the process that it triggered in me to start noting how
badly I was typing and how badly many others were typing.</p>
<p>The problem is that almost all people are a self-taught typist and everyone
with their technique, this technique is usually correlated with inefficiency,
and sometimes speed. I saw many people typing very fast with only 4 fingers, which
in result makes more noise by jumping from one letter to another very fast but
on that particular keyboard, on another keyboard they would struggle because
the muscle memory doesn’t recognize a different keyboard. And it makes so much
harder improving the speed when not using all of your fingers.</p>
<p>I had the same problem as the majority of people, and I wasn’t recognizing it.
For years I would use 4-6 fingers and always from time to time I would
take a look at the keyboard for a specific character or a letter. The right
hand would type the keys on the left side and opposite. That was my typing
technique.</p>
<p>So I started doing some research and got to know better how touch-typing works.
Luckily the web is full of touch-typing resources and training websites, that
I settled for <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">TypingClub</a>. The website is full of exercises and statistics
on your writing progress in beautiful UI that it satisfies all of my nerdy
requirements, and it’s completely free or supports the services and get some
additional features with as little as 7.50 euros a month.</p>

part was creating a practicing routing and trying to touch-type as much as
possible. That is easier said than done. The beggining was painful, I was slow at
work and I was wasting a lot of my concentration on typing. My fingers were
feeling tired and sometimes in pain, they have never done anything like that.
Changing the muscle memory and rewiring my brain after many years to something
almost unknown was getting into my way.</p>
<p>So I decided to make a switch from an <a href="https://amzn.to/31H9Qgc">Apple keyboard</a> to a mechanical keyboard.
And I got the idea that if I get a keyboard with the blank keycaps I would be
obligated to learn to touch-type and forget about looking at the keyboard. The
idea was promising but also scary for the scenarios like typing a password,
typing with one hand.. so again I did some research! And many people confirmed
my idea and I decided to follow it.</p>
<p>Finding a good keyboard that would last and endure a lot typing was my initial
idea, but there aren’t many keyboards with blank keycaps unless you customize
it. So the list came down to these candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3acp0On">Das Keyboard 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3kBK9WP">Filco Ninja Majestouch-2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2XQ3Mkj">Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB) Professional2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Filco keyboard is a little different than the other two, by having the keycaps
printed on the bottom side instead on top. This would work better in cases like
typing a password or typing anything with one hand. For someone who doesn’t
want to go extreme this is a good solution.</p>
<p>All of these keyboards are exceptionally good, but having already had
experience with MX Cherry switches, I decided to give a try to Topre
switches with an HHKB. It’s more Vim-style orianted by having no arrow keys
with a clean and minimal design.</p>

and the school to deep dive into this. At the begging I was struggling, but
a keyboard like this pushes you to learn a proper fingers placement on the
home row and unlink all the habits of looking down for a key. It took time
and a lot of practice but it paid off. Today I type comfortably on a blank
keyboard with the average speed of 70-90 wpm and I’m still improving. It is
a huge productivity boost.</p>

<p>I didn’t know that my next project will turn into a nudity platform and a home for spammers. But it did happen while I wasn’t paying attention. And here are the details.</p>



<p>For the next 5/10 years, I’ve decided that my mission will be: “<strong>Can a Moroccan build an online business and make a living from Morocco?</strong>“. I currently launch multiple projects and give them some time to take off. My blog <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>, my jobs board <a href="https://okjob.io/">okjob.io</a>, and other projects are all examples of this. The project I’m talking about today, was also serving the same purpose in theory, but it was a flop.</p>



<p>That project is <a href="https://mylink.fyi/">mylink.fyi</a>, a personal and unique link for all your other links. I built it during my weekends given I already have a full-time job and it took me two months approximately. It’s like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">linktree</a> and other competitors, but I tried to make it different. No ads, no logo, a clean interface, a 100% score in performance… My idea was: take a competitor product, remove all features you don’t need, and make it crazy fast. You have a 14 days free trial to test it out, but you need to upgrade your account afterwards.</p>



<p>I launched it in February 2020 with a completely different identity. I took my name, and thus my followers and my authority, out of the equation. <strong>I wanted to replicate “someone starting from scratch” as close as possible</strong>. I did use the service for my links (and <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>‘s links) but I never advertised the service on my personal account. You can see the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mylink-fyi">Product Hunt</a> launch, and the imaginary <a href="https://twitter.com/HamidNekcha">Twitter account</a> I created.</p>



<p>Given how I built the app, I optimized it in a way I’ll only pay hosting fees when the site is having a lot of traffic. Like 1M+ visits per month. So I forgot about it, and kept an eye on the bills I get. Two weeks after launch, I had 100 users. No premium account.</p>



<p>Three months went by with 0$ bills. But in June, I received <strong>my non-zero bill</strong>, it’s exciting the app is taking off! I logged to Firebase (the infrastructure I’m using) and found a total of 1000 users! Wow, that’s a lot.</p>



<p>I took a look at the emails, and quickly saw that something was off. I’ve seen multiple accounts with the same email structure, something like emily123@gmail.com, emily456@gmail.com… I knew something isn’t right given there is a lot of them. So I decided to take a closer look and see the links they are sharing.</p>



<p>That’s when I discovered <strong>they were sharing porn and nudes links</strong>. These links aren’t permitted on social media, so they used mylink.fyi to “shadow” them. For these platforms, they are mylink.fyi links. But once you visit it, you’ll see a link for the banned site. <strong>There were hundreds of accounts doing this</strong>. And new ones get created every day. Once the trial period is over, they create a new email, a new account, and then repeat the same process. Oups!</p>



<p>I decided to remove all my links from the platform given it’s probably known for “porn and nudes” now. I logged to Instagram, and got a weird message: “<strong>Your profile link is not working</strong>“. I didn’t know what that means, but once I visited my profile, I’ve seen I can’t click on the mylink.fyi link. Wow, what’s that? I visited my other profile, and got the same message and the same problem! I later discovered that Instagram banned all mylink.fyi links from the platform. A customer also confirmed to me via email that Snapchat started blocking links. Heh, I’m banned by Instagram and Snapchat! From all scenarios I had in mind, <strong>this is not something I prepared for</strong>.</p>



<p>The first thing I tried is reducing the trial period from 14 days to 5 days. I was hoping I’ll make them stop. But nothing changed, I can’t outplay them. Damn it! Other solutions include: requiring credit cards for trial periods, ban all adult content from the platform… But they all require me to put extra effort in the project. And I don’t have time for that.</p>



<p>I disabled signups on mylink.fyi for now, and after all trials reach their end, I’ll take the service off. If you’re interested in acquiring the domain name, and/or the app, <a href="https://elazzabi.com/contact/">let’s talk</a>.</p>



<p><strong>That’s it for your daily dose of weird Internet anecdotes.</strong></p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Not only is layout shift annoying and a bad user experience, it's now part of Google's Core Web Vitals which will become a ranking factor for Google Search in 2021.</p>
    <p>Lighthouse is a great tool for identifying your Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score, but it's not so great for quickly visualising what's actually changing on a page. The Layout Shift GIF Generator allows you to quickly see which elements are moving around in the viewport and return your CLS metric.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>The tool is able to check both a desktop and a mobile viewport.</p><p><em>- The desktop viewport is a standard 1920x1080 resolution.</em></p>
        <p><em>- The mobile viewport is the Nexus 5X profile from Lighthouse.</em></p>
        <p>Both the CPU and the network are throttled simulating a good 3G network.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Command Line Tool</h3>
    <p>The command line tool can be installed directly from <a href="https://github.com/workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif">GitHub</a> using NPM.</p>
    <pre>npm install -g workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif</pre>
    <p>Once installed the tool can be used as per the following example.</p>
    <pre>layout-shift-gif --url https://blacklivesmatter.com/ --device mobile --output layout-shift.gif</pre>
    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <h3>1.0.0</h3>
    <p>- All the changes.</p>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <p>- If there is a lot of vertical movement on a page it can be difficult to discern which elements have shifted.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="django-views-the-right-way">

<p>Welcome to my opinionated guide on how to write views in Django!</p>
<p>It is the result of mistakes made and lessons learned in a range of
Django and Python projects over 15+ years.</p>
<p>It has also been prompted by the fact that “Class Based Views” (CBVs from now
on) seem to have become the default way to teach and learn Django views in some
circles, to the point that some are even scared to write “Function Based Views”
(FBVs).</p>
<p>Perhaps worst of all, some official Django documentation has <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/class-based-views/mixins/">well-intentioned
advise that will help to continue the torture of mixins</a>, but
without actually killing you and putting you out of your misery. (After a bit of
“git blaming” it turns out that I’m <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/c4c7fbcc0d9264beb931b45969fc0d8d655c4f83">credited</a>
in the commit log for that page. I hate it when that happens…)</p>
<p>So, in view of all this, here I am to save the day, and show you The Right Way
:-)</p>
<p>The essential part of this guide is very short, because FBVs are very easy and
simple. In fact, the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial03/">Django tutorial for views</a> already has all you
need to know. Just read that, and skip the bits about CBVs, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>But if you want a different take on the same things, this guide might be for
you. I’ve also added extra bits for common tasks and patterns in FBVs for which
CBVs are often suggested as the solution. I have a few aims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to show how simple and easy views can be.</p></li>
<li><p>I want you to be freed from learning a whole stack of additional APIs that
were only making your life harder (and teaching you bad patterns).</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of learning a bunch of Django specific APIs, I want to cover much more
transferable knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTTP principles</p></li>
<li><p>General OOP/multi-paradigm programming principles</p></li>
<li><p>General Python techniques</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are some other goodies along the way, like how to type-check all the
URL parameters to your view functions.</p>
<p>Each page is composed of <strong>two parts</strong>, which have <strong>two different audiences</strong>.</p>
<p>First, the business — the <strong>what and how</strong>: a short, definitive guide to The
Right Way. As a less experienced developer, either in general or in terms of
knowledge of Django, this part is all you need. Since this guide is not intended
to be reference documentation, I’ll include various links to the official Django
reference docs. All example code can be found in full in the <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way/tree/master/code">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Second, discussion — the <strong>why</strong>: a longer, in-depth explanation of why everyone
else who tells you differently is wrong :-). It’s targeted at slightly more
experienced developers, and especially those who are responsible for teaching
other people, or making decisions about the patterns used in a code base. These
discussion sections are really about general programming principles, and how
they apply in Python and Django.</p>
<p>So let’s go!</p>

<p>Something missing? This guide is a <strong>work in progress</strong>, and no matter how much
I add it probably always will be! If you have requests for things to include,
you could file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div><div id="caveats-and-disclaimers-etc">

<ol>
<li><p>Yes, there may in fact be more than one Right Way. But not in this guide!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m assuming you are writing a ‘classic’ web app or web site — in which
most of your pages are server-side rendered HTML, with perhaps some Javascript
loaded onto those pages, as opposed to a site where your server mostly sends
data (e.g. JSON) to a client-side Javascript web app that puts the pages together.</p></li>
<li><p>My comments mainly apply to the CBVs that come with Django. Specifically,
many of my criticisms don’t apply to Django Rest Framework, the Django admin
(which uses a form of CBV), and possibly other implementations. See later
discussion on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Although I’m a Django core dev, I’m not speaking for all the Django
developers. I was actually around when CBVs were first being added to Django,
and even involved in the design of them a bit, and at the time didn’t see the
things I’m expressing now. So please understand my criticisms as a form of
“learning process debate”, rather than as attacks!</p></li>

August 11, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/urql-graphql-client/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/urql-graphql-client/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Universal React Query Library (URQL) is a highly customizable GraphQL client, exposed as a set of React components by <a href="https://formidable.com/">Formidable</a>, aiming to become a lightweight alternative that would uphold the principal values of the GraphQL protocol &amp; SDL.</p>
<p>Currently, the most popular client libraries come with large API footprints. URQL’s  main goal is to simplify some of the most popular aspects arising when using GraphQL by providing:</p>
<h3>1. The Declarative Queries</h3>
<p>URQL Client internally manages the lifetime and updates for query &amp; mutation operations in the background:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a cache invalidates their results you may receive updated data,</li>
<li>when your app stops being interested in results URQL will teardown the operation (it will stop requesting new data, stop updating results)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. The abstracted caching</h3>
<p>Caching is handled &amp; customizable with so-called Exchanges. The default <code>cacheExchange</code> offers basic cache implementation that will avoid sending the same requests to a GraphQL API repeatedly by caching the result of each query. For more complex cases containing data interdependencies, URQL offers normalized caching provided by <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/tree/main/exchanges/graphcache"><code>@urql/exchange-graphcache</code></a> package.</p>
<h3>3. The central point of extensibility and integration with GraphQL API</h3>
<p>URQL provides <code>Exchanges</code> to abstract how the Client interacts with frameworks, GraphQL API, or your app. URQL’s  <code>Exchanges</code> have access to all operations and all results (the concept is very similar to middlewares in Redux). The core package’s default behaviors are implemented using Exchanges as both operations as their results are treated as a stream of events:</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Built to be easy to use</strong> -  URQL prioritizes usability and adaptability aiming to be the first-choice pick for both, newcomers as well as GraphQL power-users,</li>
<li><strong>Performant and functional</strong> - Lightweight &amp; powerful GraphQL client, easy to use with React, Preact, and Svelte, makes URQL a great alternative to other bulky GraphQL clients.</li>
<li><strong>Logical default behavior and caching</strong> - URQL enables you to use GraphQL in your apps out of the box without complex configurations, large API overhead, and all that fuss.</li>
<li><strong>Easily extensible</strong> - one of the most interesting concepts presented in URQL are <em>Exchanges</em>. They are a kind of middleware that will help you change how you fetch, cache, or subscribe to data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>The method <code>createClient</code> creates the GraphQL client which requires providing API’s URL as a bare minimum. This Client will manage all your operations. To make it work in React &amp; Preact provide it via the Context API with the help of the <code>Provider</code> export.</p>
<div data-language="react"><pre><code>import { createClient, Provider } from 'urql';
const client = createClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
});
const App = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Provider value={client}&gt;
    &lt;YourRoutes /&gt;
  &lt;/Provider&gt;
);</code></pre></div>

<p>Statistics and charts can be tricky and they are often used to push a certain point-of-view. However, with some critical thinking and basic school-level mathematics, we are all capable of understanding what the data means. We do not need to be scientists, mathematicians or subject-matter experts to come to sensible and informed conclusions.</p>
<p>Let’s strip away the frightening news headlines and look at what the evidence shows us.</p>
<h2>Table of contents</h2>

<div><div>
<h2 id="key-facts">Five key facts</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/dr-scott-atlas/">Dr. Scott W.&nbsp;Atlas</a>, we now have enough data to be sure of five key facts about COVID-19:</p>
<ol><li>The overwhelming majority of people do not have any significant risk of dying from COVID-19.</li><li>Protecting older, at-risk people eliminates hospital overcrowding.</li><li>Vital population immunity is prevented by total isolation policies, prolonging the problem.</li><li>People are dying because other medical care is not getting done due to hypothetical projections.</li><li>We have a clearly defined population at risk who can be protected with targeted measures.</li></ol>
</div></div>
<p><em><a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/dr-scott-atlas/">Dr. Scott Atlas</a> is the David and Joan Traitel Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution and the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center.</em></p>
<div><div>
<h2 id="mostly-harmless">Harmless to most people</h2>
<p>Public Health England, on their <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/covid-19-is-no-longer-considered-a-high-consequence-infectious-disease-public-health-england/">21 March 2020 update</a> for High consequence infectious diseases (HCID), stated, <em>“As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease in the UK.”</em> If COVID-19 is not a high consequence infectious disease, why was the UK thrown into uncharted territory without debate?</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Nevertheless, despite spending weeks on lock-down; after destroying our economy and businesses; after causing mass unemployment; after inflicting unimaginable suffering to the entire nation, the UK Government again admitted that coronavirus is completely harmless to most people.</p>
<p>On the 11 May 2020 Downing Street Press Briefing, the UK’s Chief Medical Officer, <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/professor-chris-whitty/">Professor Chris Whitty</a>, confirmed:</p>
<p><em>“Most people will not get this virus at all. Of those who get symptoms, the vast majority will have a mild or moderate disease. The great majority of people, even in the highest risk groups, will not die.”</em></p>

<h3 id="infection-fatality-rate">Infection fatality rate</h3>
<p>Multiple studies have found that COVID-19 has an infection <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/mortality-rate/">fatality rate</a> of between 0.02% and 0.8%.</p>
<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate#Terminology" target="_blank">infection fatality rate</a> (IFR) is an estimated death rate in all those who have been infected with a disease. This includes those who have been found to be infected (called ‘cases’), as well as those who were undetected, either because they have not been tested or are not showing symptoms.</p>
<p>The <em>case fatality rate</em>, on the other hand, is the measure of deaths among <em>diagnosed</em> cases. The <em>mortality rate</em> is the number of deaths in a specific population, such as the population of the United Kingdom, over a period of time.</p>
<p>The IFR tends to give a better overall mortality for non-experts and therefore is <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-published-research-data-on-covid-19-infection-fatality-rates-medrxiv/">increasingly being used</a> by policy-makers.</p>
<h2 id="covid19-flu">Comparison with flu</h2>
<p>During the start of the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/hysteria/">COVID-19 panic</a>, we constantly heard the media and politicians saying that <a href="#inproportion">comparing</a> COVID-19 with <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/influenza/">flu</a> is irresponsible. Apparently, COVID-19 is so deadly and spreads so quickly that governments needed to impose <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/at-stake/#civil-liberties">unprecedented control</a> over society in order to fight it.</p>
<p>In contrast, this is what epidemiologists, microbiologists and researchers have been telling us:</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul><li>We should tackle COVID-19 just as we currently do with <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/influenza/">seasonal influenza</a>. Sick people should stay at home, the vulnerable should be protected but the healthy should get on with their lives as normal.</li><li>COVID-19 is deadly for vulnerable people but anyone at risk from COVID-19 is also at serious risk from flu. Even the common cold may have a <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/mortality-rate/">death rate</a> as high <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/studies-show-6-death-rates-from-common-cold-in-risk-groups-nih/">as 6% in risk groups</a>. </li><li>In some countries COVID-19 may have a lower <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/mortality-rate/">mortality rate</a> than flu.</li><li>Cases for COVID-19 are not increasing exponentially. Instead, we are seeing an ‘explosion in <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/testing/">testing</a>‘ for COVID-19.</li><li>The <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/statistics/">high death rates</a> in some countries are due counterproductive <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/treatment/">treatment methods</a>, such as intubation and the use of steroids.</li><li>Some level of social distancing is helpful but a general lock-down and house arrest of the entire population will prove to be a disaster.</li></ul>
</div></div>
<p>Here is what no-one, even officially approved mainstream sources, appears to dispute: <strong><em>in at least 80% cases, the virus produces either no symptoms or a mild cold-like illness</em></strong>.</p>
<div><div>
<h2 id="lockdown">Flawed evidence for lock-down</h2>
<p>Countries have taken different approaches and there is <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/lockdown/">no evidence that lockdowns</a> have reduced COVID-19 deaths. Inaccurate testing and inconsistent reporting methods is a big problem. We also have no evidence that <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/at-stake/#nhs">our NHS</a> would have faced any greater strain when compared to previous flu seasons. In fact, the medical systems of most countries are stretched every flu season.</p>
<p>In the UK, we are told that a lock-down is needed to ‘flatten the curve’. This was based on unfounded assumptions and <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/imperial-college/">flawed Imperial College models</a> that predicted half a million deaths from COVID-19. The report that lead to the lock-down was retracted days after release, with the number scaled down first to 20,000 and then to just over 6,000. <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/professor-neil-ferguson">Professor Neil Ferguson</a>, the author of the report, has a <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/neil-ferguson-the-scientist-who-convinced-boris-johnson-of-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-criticised-in-past-for-flawed-research-the-telegraph/">track record of failed predictions</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the lockdown was still enforced. Our entire county has been shut down, millions have been made <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/at-stake/#economy">unemployed and businesses are ruined</a> due to flawed models and bad advice.</p>
<h3 id="nonlockdown-lockdown">Non-lockdown vs Lockdown</h3>
<p>The graph below, from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/" target="_blank">UK Column</a> news, compares the deaths and cases, between non-lockdown (left) and lockdown (right) countries. A similar chart compares non-lockdown (left) and lockdown (right) states in the US.</p>
<p>We can see that in general, areas that have implemented lockdown have higher death rates.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> These charts are outdated. The death numbers have changed and Mexico moved into lockdown after the chart was compiled (see visitor comment <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/evidence/#comment-63">16 May 2020</a>). They have been left to illustrate the differences between lockdown and non-lockdown areas around April. However, we will update the charts when new versions are available. </em></p>

Morgan</a> Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy, released around 20 May 2020, supports the argument that lockdowns did not help stop the spread of the virus. The<em> J.P. Morgan figure 1</em> chart shows that many US states saw a lower rate of transmission after lockdowns were ended. <em>J.P. Morgan figure 2</em> shows that most countries saw their infection rates fall after lockdown.</p>
<h3 id="lockdown-deaths">Deaths caused by the lockdown</h3>
<p>Alistair Haimes, a data professional who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thecritic.co.uk/author/alistair-haimes/" target="_blank">writes for The Critic</a>, posted the chart below showing weekly deaths at home registered with the Office for National Statistics. The majority of these do not have COVID-19 mentioned in the death certificate. It shows a disproportionate number of deaths at home over the 5-year average, indicating that these are likely to have been <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/collateral-damage/">caused by the lockdown</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the InProportion2 project released the following chart showing the proportion of weekly deaths due to COVID-19 in the context of total deaths during the 1999/2000 flu season. The blue bars show the 2020 lockdown deaths <em>not attributed to COVID-19</em>. Interestingly, the <em>fewer</em> people died during the April 2020 peak than in January 2000.</p>

<h3 id="flawed-modelling-code">Buggy modelling code</h3>
<p>Code reviews of the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/imperial-college/">Imperial College modelling software</a> written by <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/professor-neil-ferguson">Professor Ferguson</a> began to appear in early May 2020. The <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/code-review+imperial-college+errors/">comments from professional programmers were scathing</a>. They found it badly written, full of bugs and produced random results. One reviewer went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“This Ferguson Model is such a joke it is either an outright fraud, or it is the most inept piece of programming I may have ever seen in my life.”</em></p><cite><a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/i-have-reviewed-fergusons-code-its-a-joke/">Martin Armstrong</a>, 8 May 2020</cite></blockquote>
<p>There is only one reasonable conclusion we can draw from both the lockdown’s results and the code reviews: the British Government’s decision to lock down the country was based on bogus numbers.</p>

<p><em>Social distancing</em> is a term that has recently gained popularity as the main way to defeat COVID-19. It includes measures ranging from spaced queues at the supermarket to complete lockdown of cities and countries. In this context, we do not equate social distancing with the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/pandemics/">historically proven</a> practice of protecting vulnerable people from flu-like viruses by isolating them from risk.</p>
<p>What is the scientific rationale for COVID-19 style social distancing?</p>
</div></div>

<div>
<p><a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/no-scientific-proof-social-distancing-prevents-spread-of-covid-19-professor-joel-hay-usc/">According to Professor Joel Hay</a>, PhD Health Economist at University of Southern California, there is no scientific proof that <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/social-distancing/">social distancing</a> prevents the spread of coronavirus. He advocates that we should “do what we always do”: isolate the frail and sick but don’t isolate the young and healthy. According to Professor Hay, <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/herd-immunity/">herd immunity</a> is how we’ve solved the problem in the past. Social distancing is destroying millions of lives and killing more people than it saves.</p>

<h3 id="two-metre-rule">Two metre rule</h3>
<p>The social distancing rules adopted by different countries is arbitrary and has no scientific basis. Different countries use different rules ranging from the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/who/">WHO</a>‘s recommended three feet (just under one metre) in Sweden and Austria, 1.5 metres in Germany and The Netherlands, to two metres in the UK and US.</p>
<p>Robert Dingwall from the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) said Britain’s two meter rule was ‘<a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/government-adviser-says-social-distancing-rule-guidelines-on-keeping-apart-was-conjured-out-of-nowhere-daily-mail/">conjured up out of nowhere</a>’ because the government didn’t trust the public to keep 1 metre apart.

August 11, 2020 | https://blog.liteflow.com/2020/08/11/how-to-create-todo-list-apps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.liteflow.com/2020/08/11/how-to-create-todo-list-apps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">#</a> Introduction</h2> <p>To-do list apps are typical examples of applications to learn a new framework or a new tool. They are a great way to learn something new without focusing on a complicated use case, yet having something interesting enough for people to start a real project. This tutorial will follow the long list of tutorials that you can find <a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and focus on the synchronization of data with a Liteflow <a href="https://blog.liteflow.com/_posts/en/2020-08-05-reactive-database-feature.html">database</a>, <a href="https://blog.liteflow.com/_posts/en/2020-05-22-http-endpoint-trigger-feature.html">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://blog.liteflow.com/_posts/en/2020-07-24-email-feature.html">email</a> service.</p> <p>Our to-do list app will have multiple features. At the end of this tutorial, we will be able to visualize our to-dos, edit them, and delete them. All of this synchronized on a server without having to maintain any Backend application using Liteflow.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.liteflow.com/assets/img/todo.411d20c9.png" alt="To-do App"></p> <h2 id="create-the-ui-and-the-interactions-of-the-to-do-list-app"><a href="#create-the-ui-and-the-interactions-of-the-to-do-list-app">#</a> Create the UI and the interactions of the to-do list app</h2> <p>For this step, I will reuse an existing to-do application frontend and will use the one using <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/todomvc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vuejs</a>.</p> <p>First, create the following <code>index.html</code> file containing the user interface (UI) and the interactions for our application (e.g., create a to-do, mark a to-do as done/undone, remove a to-do).</p> <p>You can now open your <code>index.html</code> file in your browser to visualize your to-do list app.</p> <p>To add features in our application, we will create processes. These processes handle your application's business logic and can be used as an API or connected to any service's event.</p> <p>We will add 5 features in our application:</p> <ul><li><a href="#add-a-todo">Add a todo</a></li> <li><a href="#list-the-todos">List the todos</a></li> <li><a href="#update-a-todo">Update a todo</a> (mark is as done/undone)</li> <li><a href="#delete-a-todo">Delete a todo</a></li> <li><a href="#notify-when-a-todo-is-done">Notify when a todo is done</a></li></ul> <h2 id="add-a-to-do"><a href="#add-a-to-do">#</a> Add a to-do</h2> <p>The first feature we will implement is to add a new to-do and create an API for this creation of to-do using a process. For that, we are using the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/http.html#request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP request</a> trigger and the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Database create</a> task.</p> <p>The data are stored in the <code>todos</code> collection based on the data sent over the API.</p> <p>Let's create a <code>create.yml</code> file with the following:</p> <p>Then we can deploy this process using the <code>liteflow deploy</code> command. It will generate a unique endpoint to trigger this process that the to-do will use.</p> <p>Once this process is deployed, you can update your <code>index.html</code> file by updating the <code>addTodo</code> function (line 60) with the following code:</p> <p>The <code>addTodo</code> function now saves a new to-do in the database by triggering the process <code>create-todo</code> with an HTTP POST request.</p> <p>You can now create to-dos and visualize them directly in the <a href="https://console.liteflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database page</a> of your project on the console.</p> <h2 id="list-the-to-dos"><a href="#list-the-to-dos">#</a> List the to-dos</h2> <p>Your application accepts to publish new to-dos, but when you refresh the page, everything is gone. This is because it doesn't get the to-dos when the application loads. Let's fix this by creating a process that will query the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database</a> and return the list of to-dos in the collection <code>todos</code>.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>fetch-todos.yml</code> with the following content:</p> <p>Deploy the process using the command <code>liteflow deploy</code> to get the endpoint for this process.</p> <p>Then, update the <code>fetch</code> method to get the data and populate the to-dos in the application.</p> <p>Refresh your application. All your to-dos should be loaded and you can still add new to-dos.</p> <h2 id="update-a-to-do"><a href="#update-a-to-do">#</a> Update a to-do</h2> <p>We now need a way to update our to-dos. We can apply the same principle as the <code>create-todo</code> process, but this time with the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database update</a> task.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>update-todo.yml</code> with the following content:</p> <p>Deploy the process using the command <code>liteflow deploy</code> to get the endpoint for this process.</p> <p>You can then update your <code>updateTodoStatus</code> function with the endpoint given while deploying your process.</p> <h2 id="delete-a-to-do"><a href="#delete-a-to-do">#</a> Delete a to-do</h2> <p>Let's create our last feature accessible via the UI, deleting a to-do.
Sometime when a to-do is done or was created by mistake, we need a way to delete it. We again apply the same principle using this time the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#delete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Database delete</a> task.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>delete-todo.yml</code> with the following content:</p> <p>Deploy the process using the command <code>liteflow deploy</code> to get the endpoint for this process.</p> <p>And, finally, update our <code>removeTodo</code> function with the endpoint created while deploying.</p> <p>Congratulation, now your application is fully functional with your UI, and all your data are stored in a private database with custom APIs to access it.</p> <h2 id="notify-when-a-to-do-is-done"><a href="#notify-when-a-to-do-is-done">#</a> Notify when a to-do is done</h2> <p>Let's now implement a notification when a to-do is done. We want to send an email to an email address every time a to-do is marked as done.</p> <p>To do that, we can use the Database feature to react to any changes in the data using the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#onupdated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>onUpdated</code></a> event.</p> <p>The process will do the following:
Every time a data is updated, filter to keep only the item from the <code>todo</code> collection, and the value of <code>completed</code> is <code>true</code>. Then, send an email using the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/email.html#send" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email send</a> task.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>notify-todo.yml</code> with the following content (don't forget to replace <code>__REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL__</code> with your email):</p> <p>You can now deploy this process and mark a to-do as done. After a few seconds, you should receive an email notifying you that a task has just been completed.</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h2> <p>In this tutorial, we have seen the following things:</p> <ul><li><strong>How to store, query, update and delete data without having to set up any database</strong></li> <li><strong>How to create APIs to access these data without having to create any server</strong></li> <li><strong>How to connect our frontend to these APIs</strong></li> <li><strong>How to run background jobs that react to the database to send email without setting up any email provider</strong></li></ul> <p><em>Of course, this is a basic example of what you can do in the context of to-do list apps, but you can build anything you want using these features.</em></p> <p>We would love to hear your feedback regarding this tutorial, and your experience with the creation of your to-do list app with Liteflow. Don't hesitate to share it with us in the comment section below.</p> <h3 id="bonus"><a href="#bonus">#</a> Bonus</h3> <p>Did you know that you can also <strong>deploy in one click</strong> your to-do list app on Liteflow in just a few seconds?

<h2>UPDATE</h2>



<p>It has been brought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee. </p>



<p>So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.</p>



<p>So now I have been told that all the NOC’s will be taken care of by the Revenue Department, Collector Office. </p>



<p>If any legal fees need to be paid, I will be informed by the Collector office (without me requiring to go to every office) and everything will be done in less than 2 months.</p>



<p>I am thankful to everyone for sharing my experience far and wide. But now my experience stands cleared and so does this post. </p>



<p>A lot of people have helped reach this post to very very high-in-the-hierarchy people in the state and central government as well as major national political parties. I am really very thankful to everyone.</p>



<p>I will try again in a few months and keep surveying the experience of people who get their NA done. Thank you again for all the co-operation.</p>



<p>I am also writing a post about “the real process required to obtain the NA permission”. I will try to get the higher authorities from the Collector office to record a video stating the actual procedure required and will publish such article soon.</p>



<p>Again Thank You Very Much.</p>



<p>I have removed the original post. I will update with next steps soon. </p>

            <!-- content --><p>In 2020, Arm is making rapid advancements in the server space well beyond what we have seen in recent years. Aside from the obvious hardware advancements (which we will get into later in this article), the biggest piece of the puzzle here is arguably the software ecosystem maturity. Many workloads can now more or less seamlessly transition from running on traditional x86 hardware to running on Armv8 metal. In this article, we are going to explore the Arm opportunity at cloud service providers or CSPs.<span id="more-45868"></span></p>
<p><em>Note on naming conventions: throughout this article, we will use x86 as a shorthand for x86_64, which is also known as amd64. In this context, it means traditional, Intel-compatible hardware. Armv8 stands for the – relatively – new Arm architecture, outed by Arm Holdings in 2011, and also capable of 64-bit memory addressing. Armv8 is also sometimes known as AArch64 or arm64. We need to keep things simple and standardize.</em></p>
<h2>Arm software ecosystem maturity</h2>
<p>Hardware and software engineers often see their jobs as different, but in order to bring about new architecture, better software means better investment in hardware and better hardware means more are willing to invest in software. Having an Arm server hardware discussion necessarily means that we need to discuss the software side. Indeed, that has been perhaps the most visible area of advancement over the past half-decade.</p>
<p>Arm’s software ecosystem has not hit an x86 level of maturity despite what many of its promoters argue. In many cases there may still be a bit a software engineering required, like tweaking compilation flags or container configuration files. In turn, these small tweaks often mean incremental testing effort. As a result, swapping from x86 to Arm has a switching cost. It may be a small cost, but the swap is usually non-zero. While closed source software is another story, open-source software underpinning popular workloads at CSPs, is rapidly gaining maturity. For example nginx a popular web server has done a great job developing its Arm solution.</p>

<p>Armv8 software maturity has come a long way in the last few years. All popular Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora, Centos, and OpenSUSE now offer an Armv8 spin just as naturally as they offer a traditional x86 spin. This was not the case a few years ago. We have already covered this topic <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">in February of last year</a> when Arm launched its Neoverse line of server CPU cores. Other vendors are moving this direction as well as we are seen even legacy platforms such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-esxi-64-bit-arm-support-announced/">VMware ESXi venture to 64-bit Arm support</a>.</p>
<p>A second very important milestone in the Arm software ecosystem came last year when NVIDIA <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-announces-arm-support-for-gpu-accelerated-computing/">announced</a> support for CUDA-on-Arm at SC19. This was essentially a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-cuda-on-arm-becoming-a-reality/">very potent signal</a> sent to all the industry that Armv8 was soon to be considered on par with x86 for running GPU-accelerated workloads. AI is a pioneering workload, in the field. NVIDIA offering its full AI stack on Arm to build parity with x86 is a big deal since it is an offering for the future of compute, not the past.</p>
<h2>New Armv8 hardware changes the game</h2>
<p>Even though having software that ‘just works’ is essential, one also needs hardware. And in this regard, the Arm world certainly does not disappoint and is as vibrant as ever. Three main actors stand out: Ampere Computing, Marvell, and Amazon’s AWS. (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/huawei-kunpeng-920-64-core-arm-server-cpu/">Huawei</a> in China as well, although we are going to set that aside for now.) You will of course immediately note that if the first two are CPU vendors, the third one is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) or a traditional Intel Xeon customer.</p>
<p>Ampere Computing has already had its 7nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-80-arm-cores-for-cloud/">Altra</a> sampling for a few months now. As a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-q80-30-in-action-at-ampere-hq/">reminder</a>, it is certainly a solid 2P capable offering on paper, with up to 80 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">N1 cores</a> at up to 3.3Ghz, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 128 PCIe Gen4 lanes (192 in a 2P configuration), all for a TDP of up to 250W. Ampere Computing has already announced next year’s follow up, the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-max-targets-a-128-core-arm-cpu-shipping-in-2021/">Altra Max</a>, which stays on 7nm and pushes the core count to 128. 2022 will see the company outing its 5nm Siryn follow-up.</p>

<p>Marvell, for its part, finalized its acquisition of Cavium in 2018, has arguably been the first Arm CPU vendor to properly enter the data center market, and we have covered the ThunderX2 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx2-review-benchmarks-real-arm-server-option/">extensively</a> since its 2018 launch and the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx-micro-benchmarks-enterprise-arm-developers-need-machines/">ThunderX</a> before it. Marvell’s counterpart to the Ampere Altra is the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/marvell-thunderx3-arm-server-cpu-with-768-threads-in-2020/">ThunderX3</a>, to become available this year. It is also a 2P capable 7nm part with eight DDR4-3200 channels but limited to 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes per CPU (128 in a 2P configuration.) Where it differs greatly from Ampere’s offering is in the choices of CPU cores. Instead of going for “off the shelf” Arm N1 cores, Marvell is using custom Arm cores, offering 4-way Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). The ThunderX3 will be offered with up to 96 cores (and thus 384 threads) per socket. This is a big differentiating point for Marvell. Just like everyone else, Marvell has a roadmap, and a ThunderX4 is slated for 2022. It will likely be a 5nm part.</p>

<p>And then there is Amazon. Having bought the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exclusive-gigabyte-annapurna-labs-arm-storage-server-benchmarks/">Anapurna Labs</a> CPU design house in 2015, and after testing the waters with a first-generation <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/putting-aws-graviton-its-arm-cpu-performance-in-context/">Graviton</a> at the end of 2018 (and selling its Arm chips for applications such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ubiquiti-unifi-usw-leaf-overview-not-review-48x-25gbe-6x-100gbe-switch/">switches</a>), Amazon announced the general availability of its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/aws-graviton2-64-core-arm-cpu-heightens-war-of-intel-betrayal/">Graviton2 based instances</a> in March of 2020. Just like the Ampere Altra, the Gaviton2 is also a Neoverse N1 based design, manufactured at 7nm. It is a single socket design, offering 64 cores, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes. The fact that AWS decided to build its own CPUs is important because a traditional Xeon/ x86 customer is now taking that in house. It also allows software development to happen at a more rapid pace by showing strong backing for Arm infrastructure, offering it to a wide array of customers. The industry is changing, and long gone are the days when only hardware vendors could decide its fate.</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp; Ampere’s <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/altra/">documentation</a> calls this “sustained turbo”, but presumably this can be treated as a kind of base clock, as all cores should be able to sustain said clock while fully loaded. To be confirmed in STH testing.</p>
<p>(2) These specifications are to be confirmed as the chips become commercially available and may change as the parts transform into shipping products.</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, a few things come to mind. First of all, the industry as a whole seems to be settling on a few “standard” specifications. Each of these three chips comes equipped with a memory controller supporting eight channels of DDR4, just like AMD’s EPYC line and Intel’s upcoming 10nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake</a> Xeon line. Likewise, 250W+ seems to be to the new upper bound for acceptable maximum TDP per socket. A quick look at AMD’s and Intel’s 2020 shipping and roadmap offerings confirms this. Arm chips are looking to keep core counts high and TDPs low.</p>

<p>Amazon designed the Graviton only for internal use, it is a simpler design focused on 1P operation. Note that Ampere Computing and Marvell opted for different solutions enabling 2P operation: Ampere uses 32 (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cxl-may-have-just-won-as-amd-joins-cxl/">CCIX</a> enabled) PCIe Gen4 lanes per processor to enable communications between the two sockets, whereas Marvell uses a dedicated interface. Enabling 2P operation complicates the design quite a bit, and as it does not have to cater to any CPU buyer’s needs but its own, Amazon went for simplicity here. This may of course change with a future generation. It also, in some ways, validates AMD’s vision for single-socket EPYC.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to explore this decision of off-the-shelf or custom Arm CPU cores.</p>

<p>GitHub pages are a great place to host the Demos and Personal Sites. But, often, you need to publish it by yourself.</p><p>Github Actions is a new Continuous Integration and Deployment solution from Github.</p><p>You can use GitHub Actions to deploy to GitHub pages on different events like</p><ul><li>Push to the main branch</li><li>New Release created</li><li>etc</li></ul><hr><p>Let's take React app for an example.</p><p>Let's make a simple app with Create React App to list latest posts from dev.to</p><p>The main idea is of having a GitHub Action to build the app and deploy on GitHub pages.</p><p>Let's initialize new app with CRA and add a new component named <code>Posts</code> and <code>Post</code></p><pre><code>npx create-react-app dev-news

cd dev-news # change dir to dev-news

mkdir src/components # create components dir in src

touch src/components/Posts.js \
 src/components/Post.js # create Posts.js &amp; Post.js Files

code . # open VSCode</code></pre><p>And following are the components to show the list of the posts; I’m putting some barebones of the Component code:</p><pre><code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
const devTo = 'https://dev.to/api/articles'

const Post = ({post}) =&gt; (
  &lt;a href={post.url} key={post.id} className="post"&gt;
    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;img src={post.social_image} alt={post.title} /&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{post.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{post.description}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
)

const Posts = () =&gt; {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([])
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    fetch(devTo).then(r=&gt; r.json()).then(setPosts)
  }, [])

  return posts.map(post =&gt; &lt;Post post={post} /&gt;)
}

export default Posts
</code></pre><p>And it will look like the following</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/time2hack/image/upload/q_auto:good,f_auto/dev.to-posts.png" alt="dev.to-posts"></figure><p>Now, we will deploy above on the GitHub pages.

git add . # stage all changes
git commit -m "🚀 init" # commit the staged changes

git remote add origin <a href="https://time2hack.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f3949a87b3949a879b8691dd909c9e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:time2hack/dev.to.git
git push -u origin master # push master to the origin
</code></pre><p>Now let’s make a directory with the name <code>.github</code> and <code>workflows</code> inside <code>.github</code>.</p><p>Inside the <code>workflows</code> directory, we can create workflows which will run the GitHub actions.</p><p>As we want to publish to GitHub pages, we will name our workflow file <code>publish.yaml</code></p><p>Now in this file, we need to write some actions/commands that need to run in specific order to publish on the GitHub pages</p><p>Following will be the contents of our <code>publish.yaml</code> file:</p><pre><code>name: github-pages

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There is a lot of praise for weekly reviews. There is noticeably less doing of weekly reviews, even among the people doing the praising. It’s a very hard habit to keep up. We could spend a lot of time diving into why that is and how to fix it in a systematic way… or I could tell you how I use <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook</a> to get many of the promised benefits of weekly reviews without any willpower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a nutshell, when I find myself making a choice about how to spend time or money that’s dependent on some expectation, I write out the expectation as a prediction (with % likelihood) in PredictionBook, which then automatically prompts me to evaluate the prediction at a date I set. This has so many benefits I’m struggling to figure out where to start. If I had to sum them up in a phrase, it would be “more contact with reality”. But to expand on that…</p>

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Q0ozB77P5ESZiGHUbcOOwEKmLkOnfe6DrHZJsRiJyWH8izn9qVWP2qO1dqem9SQO5si1RFMZ8UjhfGFKSqJkg8zcjvuo4g5_agcJ9Z610wSw-8WxabmUknYTMaXcEylDiS9WJL3Z" width="286" height="190"><figcaption>What contact with reality may look like</figcaption></figure>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Making the prediction forces me to assess my anticipated outcomes and do an expected value calculation. This in turn forces me to be explicit about what I value, and how I will know if I got it. It also makes it explicit when I’m doing something because I expect the median or modal outcome to be good, vs. when I’m doing it for the long tail of unlikely but super good outcomes. It also gives me a chance to say “huh, that EV is not competitive” and do something else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Evaluating the prompt gives me more information on how my plans are working out. <a href="https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159979927467/satisfaction-and-progress-in-open-ended-work">Andy Matuschak</a> talks about the dilemma of knowledge work, where you can’t make a plan for success but leaving things open ended often leads nowhere. His solution to this is to give himself unstructured time, but then look back and see if it worked out the way he wanted, and if it didn’t, do something different next time. Predictions provide a really natural, lightweight prompt for this reflection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes I withdraw a question for being poorly phrased- often when my answer makes the decision sound “bad” but I feel like it was actually “good”, or vice versa. This is an easy way to notice I was wrong about what I valued and look for what is actually driving my decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then there are the framing benefits. It’s easier to view something as an experiment if you’re explicitly writing down “5% chance of success”, which makes failure feel less bad. I didn’t fail to make something work, I executed the correct algorithm and it failed to produce results this particular time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Making an explicit prediction and writing it down closes open loops in my head, freeing RAM for other things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s helpful to notice when the habit doesn’t trigger. For example, I have a meeting planned today (when I’m writing this) that I just “didn’t feel inspired” to make a prediction for. When I looked closer I realized that’s because I was kind of eh on this meeting but felt obliged to take it, and was avoiding that fact. I don’t know how this is going to work out because I’m choosing to work on this blog post before tackling that, but I still credit the prediction habit with noticing, which is the first step towards better choices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also it seems like this might make my predictions more accurate, which has all kinds of applications. But to be honest that’s not what’s reinforcing this.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p dir="ltr">So we’re on the same page, here are some sample predictions, and the decisions that rested on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Reading Pavlov and his School will lead to behavior change in the area of learning or sleep (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Should I buy a physical copy of Pavlov and his School and spend the time to read it?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Talking with my friend Jane on 8/1 will be energizing (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Jane?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Bob the recruiter will describe a job that I am at all capable of and interested in doing (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Bob?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will judge the seminar on 7/28 will be worth the interruption of flow (40%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I spend money and time on this seminar?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sam will finish task Y by 7/31 (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision riding on this one, but it sure seems useful to calibrate on how well I can predict a project partner’s productivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will play with an Oculus Quest at least an hour a week (98%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy a Quest?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">California will catch fire to the point I need to keep my windows closed (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy an air conditioner?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Company Z will offer me at least an hour of work (15%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Supplement S will improve my sleep to the point I don’t need a nap (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy and use supplement S?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If I were starting from scratch, here are the instructions I would want to receive (many of which I did receive, from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create an account on <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Go to Settings to correct your time zone and set your prediction default to “visible to creator” rather than “visible to public” (unless you’d like them to be public by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a handful of predictions that will resolve over the next week (PredictionBook will e-mail you when they should be resolved).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The goal is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Quickly get feedback about how this feels for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Get yourself in the habit of making and resolving predictions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When making predictions, try to hone in on things that are decision-relevant to you; that you would do something different based on if the prediction was true or not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a link to <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new">https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new</a> in your browser so you can access it easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As you take more actions based on predictions (implicit or explicit), notice that you are doing so, and register the predictions in PredictionBook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Resolve predictions as you are prompted to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">After a week or two, check in with yourself and how you feel about the project. For calibration: I found creating the initial predictions kind of a pain but by a week in the project was naturally rewarding and required no will power on my part.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This should take &lt; 30 minutes, and it should take &lt; 45 minutes total to get a good sense of whether this is working for you.</p>

<h3>Why Does This Work?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been thinking a lot about flow and distraction recently. One thing I’ve noticed is that it takes an awful long time, measured in hours, to get into the mindset for certain tasks. Those tasks then feel amazing, unless I’m pulled out of them prematurely, which hurts (and makes it take even longer to get into the next time). There’s a lot of implications of this that I’ll hopefully get to in some other post; the relevance here is that I think weekly reviews might be one of those tasks that requires a lot of time to get into the required headspace and hurts to leave prematurely. This makes them costly- much more costly then I would have estimated before I learned to bill tasks for their prep time. It’s also something of an all or nothing task- doing 50% of your weekly review does not get you nearly 50% of the benefits of a full weekly review.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But predictions, both making and evaluating, integrate into my life pretty naturally most of the time, and scale gracefully. Writing them up can take as little as 15 seconds, and when it takes longer, it’s because I’ve discovered something important I need to work out. Doing this fits in naturally with the process of making plans, so I don’t need to spend time getting into the right head space. Evaluating them is usually trivial- and if it’s not, it’s highlighting a problem with my models.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
<p dir="ltr">“I will enjoy X” is very rarely the right prediction for me to make, because enjoyment is a tricky thing for me. I don’t like admitting I didn’t enjoy something, and sometimes I will burn a lot of energy trying to make something enjoyable, which can be a bad decision even if it works. My equivalent is “X will be energizing”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When trying to create predictions, think about what you’ll be spending money and time on in the next week. How do you think those things are going to go? What outcomes would make you change your decision?</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p dir="ltr">My original inspiration for this experiment, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jL7uDE5oH4HddYq4u/raemon-s-scratchpad?commentId=nuWrC9MxrgsjjS69W">Raemon</a>, hasn’t gotten the benefits I describe. He’s more focused on improving his prediction calibration and accuracy, and so far hasn’t done as much decision-relevant predictions. I’ve encouraged him to try it my way and hopefully he’ll comment after he’s spent a few weeks on that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PredictionBook is pleasantly lightweight but it’s already a little cluttered with predictions. If I really do solidify this habit I may need to find or create a better system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been doing this for about a month. People have kept up weekly reviews for longer before letting them fall by the wayside. I’m writing this up now because the act of solidifying a habit makes me worse at writing about it. I’ve set a reminder for 12/1 to write an update.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a> for pushing me to a better version this post and for initiating the experiment in the first place.</p>

We’ll call this flight AA2305, and we’ll use an Airbus A321 to operate it.</blockquote><p>Airlines distribute their schedules through industry data providers, who then make them available to other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers. <a href="https://www.oag.com/">OAG</a> and <a href="https://www.cirium.com/">Cirium</a> are the leaders in this space.</p><p>This isn’t just static data which changes infrequently - airlines generally update their schedules at least once a day, and there are about 800 scheduled airlines for the data providers to work with.</p><h2 id="fares">Fares</h2><p>A fare describes a price at which an airline is willing to sell seats on a particular flight, and the rules (sometimes known as "conditions") that go with that price.</p><p>A fare from American Airlines might look something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re willing to sell seats on our flights AA2305 and AA2307 for $200, as long as there is space in booking class N. However, you must book your seat as part of a return, you’ll have to stay in San Francisco for a Saturday night, and we won’t give you any refund if you want to cancel.</blockquote><p>A fare has a name, called a “fare basis code”. A fare basis code is a short set of letters and numbers - for example <code>NVAKZNM3</code>.</p><p>Fares are made up of rules which describe who is eligible for them, what flights they can be used for, and restrictions on how they can be sold or used. Examples of fare rules could include:</p><ul><li>You must fly via Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>)</li><li>You can change flights, but only if you pay a $50 penalty</li><li>You can't have a "stopover" overnight on your journey</li></ul><p>The full fare rules for a fare can easily be thousands of words long - you can see the real-life fare rules for the American Airlines fare <code>NVAKZNM3</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/timrogers/ef7a0070d29ea1ffa5d925184e7a4887">here</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the most important fare rules can be described in a structured way which a computer can understand, allowing a search engine to work out what fares match your search without a human reading through manually.</p><p>Airlines file their fares in an industry directory run by <a href="https://www.atpco.net/">ATPCO</a>, which other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers can subscribe to. Each airline can change their pricing by refiling fares many times a day. All in all, ATPCO processes more than 10 million fare updates per day.</p><p>Airlines offer many fares for the same flight at the same time, since a traveller won’t always want the cheapest, most restrictive option. For example, you might want a checked bag, or the ability to change your flights free of charge.</p><h2 id="availability">Availability</h2><p>Airlines don’t just say “this flight has seats available” or “this flight doesn’t have seats available”.</p><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can from their metal boxes flying through the sky, so they want to sell some seats cheaply, but hold some seats back for travellers who are willing to pay more.</p><p>A flight is broken into different “booking classes”, sometimes known as “reservation booking designators” (RBDs). These are letters of the alphabet, so a flight can be split into 26 different buckets: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc..</p><p>A fare points to a specific booking class. The example fare we looked at above, <code>NVAKZNM3</code>, is for the booking class <code>N</code>. Usually, the first character of the fare basis code is the booking class.</p><p>Each booking class on a flight can have different availability. For example, imagine that American Airlines uses the booking classes <code>N</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>Y</code> for economy.</p><p>They might use <code>N</code> for the most restrictive economy fares, <code>Y</code> for the most flexible ones and <code>V</code> for ones in the middle. Being able to control availability for each booking class means that “cheap economy” can be sold out, but there can still be “expensive economy” seats left.</p><p>Airlines don’t “publish” their availability. To know the latest, up-to-the-minute availability, you have to go to the airline’s passenger service system (PSS). Popular passenger service systems include <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/industries/airlines/altea-suite">Amadeus Altéa</a>, <a href="https://www.sabreairlinesolutions.com/home/software_solutions/customer_sales_service/">Sabre Sonic</a> and <a href="https://www.navitaire.com/new-skies-reservation-system">Navitaire New Skies</a>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-all-together">Putting this all together</h2><p>To find results for a simple search, a flight search engine has to combine together schedules, fares and availability.</p><p>There is only a small number of flight searches engines on the market. Most travel sellers use the search built into the global distribution system (GDS) they use (for example <a href="https://amadeus.com/">Amadeus</a>, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre</a> or <a href="https://www.travelport.com/">Travelport</a>). But there are competitors: airlines and larger sellers often use search solutions from providers like <a href="https://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA Software by Google</a> and <a href="https://pros.com/">PROS</a>.</p><p>Flight search is very complex, and it requires a lot of computer power.</p><p>The first step is to identify possible routings. For our trip from New York to San Francisco, there are tens of thousands of reasonable options if we take into account connecting flights and the full range of available airlines.</p><p>At the simple end, we could take a direct flight, <code>AA2305</code>. But we could also fly with Alaska Airlines on <code>AS17</code>, <code>AS398</code> and <code>AS3311</code>, connecting in Seattle (<code>SEA</code>) and Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>).</p><p>For each of those routings, the search engine needs to work out what fares are applicable, checking all of the rules.</p><p>There can be hundreds or thousands of potentially relevant fares to check per airline, especially given that there can be many different ways to apply fares to a set of flights.</p><p>If we take our example above with Alaska Airlines, you’d fly from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, then <code>SEA-LAX</code> and finally <code>LAX-SFO</code>. In terms of fares, this could be structured as:</p><ul><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SFO</code></li><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, and then a one-way from <code>SEA-SFO</code></li><li>Three one-ways: <code>JFK-SEA</code>, <code>SEA-LAX</code> <code>LAX-SFO</code></li><li>…</li></ul><p>If we’re booking a round trip, this gets even more complex.</p><p>Once you’ve combined the schedules and fares, you’ll have a series of “priced itineraries” - for example:</p><blockquote>You can fly on AA2305 direct from JFK to SFO for $200, using fare NVAKZNM3, as long as booking class N is available</blockquote><p>The final step is to bring availability into the picture. You’ll probably find that a lot of your priced itineraries are not available because one or more of the booking classes you need are full.</p><p>The end result is a series of search results — or what we call "offers" in the Duffel API.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>When you search for flights, a flight search engine has to combine schedules, fares and availability to generate your search results.</p><p>To do this, it has to consider hundreds of millions of options (at least!), turning them into a relatively small number of valid, relevant combinations. And all of that in just a couple of seconds!</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597054012512/yOWZ6zJsl.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Have you ever met someone who kept apologising for every question or favour they asked? Perhaps you are that person and you can hear yourself saying "sorry" over and over again for basic and normal requests which really don't need an apology. It is annoying for everyone involved and usually, the person apologising is just in <em>such</em> a habit of doing it that a gentle "No need to apologise" or even "Please stop apologising" won't actually lead to any change.</p>
<p>I heard a great tip a few years ago which could help you escape this annoying habit, and lead to better relationships with colleagues, friends, and superiors. This tip helps avoid a <strong>weird power dynamic</strong> where you put yourself in the position of someone begging or being needy, and changes it into a collaborative, positive space. In my opinion, it not only helps others respect you more, but leads to you respecting yourself more.</p>
<h2 id="replace-sorry-with-thank-you-">Replace 'sorry' with 'thank you'</h2>
<p>We know that replacing bad habits is easier than removing them completely, so every time you feel the urge to apologise for something unnecessarily, try to rephrase it as a thank you. This puts you in a better headspace, but people also feel a lot more comfortable accepting thanks than accepting unnecessary apologies. As said, it also turns a generally negative feeling and frames it positively. You're still showing gratitude without begging forgiveness for an everyday request.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Instead of</td><td>Try</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sorry for the inconvenience</td><td>Thank you for your time</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry you had to wait so long</td><td>Thank you for your patience</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry to ask, but...</td><td>Thanks for seeing me, would you mind telling me...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>You helped me so much, sorry</td><td>Thank you for helping me so much</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These are just a few examples. For me, "thank you for your time" was the most valuable and easy to implement in a variety of situations. </p>
<p><strong>If you try to utilise this technique in your everyday life, you'll see that not only do people respond a lot better to your requests and explanations, but you'll also walk away feeling more like you collaborated, rather than grovelled.</strong></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This advice does not apply for when you truly should apologise. If you hurt someone (even accidentally) or do someone wrong, you should apologise. The above is only applicable when you are in the unfortunate habit of apologising for normal requests.</p>

These frameworks create a window which GoLang can inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the UI.</p><p id="c60c">But I don’t want to write JavaScript(!) and deal with all the complexities that comes with it like npm, webpack, typescript… Fortunately, I can just compile GoLang to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly</a> (WASM) and use that in place of JavaScript. WASM is a binary format that can be executed natively in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most modern browsers</a>. <em>My </em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341"><em>previous post</em></a><em> showed how to build a WASM web-app with the Bazel.</em></p><p id="14af">Also, using WASM in a desktop app (as opposed to a web app) dodges two of its main downsides:</p><ol><li id="a01f"><strong>Large WASM binaries</strong> (especially from GoLang): these take a long time to send over the network increasing loading times. In a desktop app the binary isn’t transferred over the network, so less overhead.</li><li id="c65b"><strong>Browser incompatibility: </strong>Some WebAssembly methods are unavailable in browsers and older browsers are not supported at all. In a desktop app the “browser” is controlled (Chrome for Lorca and Safari for webview), so no compatibility issues.</li></ol><p id="382a">Let’s get started and build the app.</p><h2 id="ad5c">The Main Desktop App</h2><p id="04fb">First, I want to sketch out the <code>main</code> function for the app:</p><pre><span id="49df">func main() {<br> // Create the Data URI of index.html<br> url := fmt.Sprintf(<br>  "data:text/html,%s", <br>  url.PathEscape(assets.INDEX_HTML)<br> )</span><span id="6f7e"> // Create Lorca UI<br> ui, _ := lorca.New(url, "", 600, 200)<br> defer ui.Close()</span><span id="7141"> // Create a JS function that returns the WASM binary in base64 <br> ui.Bind("getWASM", func() string { return assets.WASM_BIN })</span><span id="4a42"> // Initialize the wasm_exec.js script<br> ui.Eval(assets.WASM_EXEC_JS)</span><span id="77ea"> // Call the initial JS functions to load the WASM<br> ui.Eval(assets.INIT_JS)</span><span id="cbed"> &lt;-ui.Done()<br>}</span></pre><p id="6eb4"><em>Note: the core difference between with webview, is using </em><code><em>Init</em></code><em> instead of </em><code><em>Eval</em></code></p><p id="062d">This app will start a Chrome window then:</p><ol><li id="9913">load the webpage with HTML <code>assets.INDEX_HTML</code></li><li id="79c2">define a function <code>getWASM</code> that is a promise of <code>assets.WASM_BIN</code>, the WASM binary as a base64 encoded string</li><li id="c64f">load the JS GoLang WASM library <code>assets.WASM_EXEC_JS</code> copied from <code>$(go env <strong>GOROOT</strong>)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js</code></li><li id="7f2e">load the JS initialization script <code>assets.INIT_JS</code></li></ol><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1676/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png" width="838" height="287" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ce8d">This is pretty simple example Lorca app, it is basically the demo example. The main complication is the <code>assets</code> package and how it can be created. This is where Bazel comes in.</p><h2 id="74f4">Embedding Files in GoLang Binary using Bazel</h2><p id="8571"><em>Note: an easier way to do this was pointed out to me using the </em><code><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/fbbbfde2dff5072fe118b369a699d456ec756b0c/go/extras.rst#id3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>go_embed_data</em></a></code><em> rule, better to use that.</em></p><p id="9249">The <code>assets</code> package contains the HTML, JS and WASM files as string constants. There are GoLang tools like <a href="https://github.com/markbates/pkger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pkger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-bindata</a> to do this, but we can keep this simple with a Bazel rule in <code>to_go_constant.bzl</code>:</p><pre><span id="aace">def to_go_constant(name, package, constant, file, base64 = False):<br> pkgStr = '&lt;(echo "package %s")' % package<br> conStr = '&lt;(echo "const %s string = \`")' % constant<br> suffix = '&lt;(echo "\`")'<br> genGo = 'cat %s %s - %s ' % (pkgStr, conStr, suffix)</span><span id="56aa">if base64:<br>  printContents = 'cat $(SRCS) | base64'<br> else:<br>  printContents = 'cat $(SRCS)'</span><span id="8c11">native.genrule(<br>  name = name,<br>  srcs = [file],<br>  outs = [name + ".go"],<br>  cmd =  printContents + ' | ' + genGo + '&gt; $@'<br> )</span></pre><p id="e3d4">This rule uses <code>cat</code> to take a <code>file</code> and output a <code>.go</code> file with the <code>package</code> and <code>const</code> defined. If <code>base64=True</code> then the file is base64 encoded.</p><p id="2176">An example of this rule in action is adding the <code>assets.INDEX_HTML</code> built from the file <code>index.html</code>:</p><pre><span id="90f6">load("//:to_go_constant.bzl", "to_go_constant")</span><span id="fba4">to_go_constant(<br>    name = "index",<br>    constant = "INDEX_HTML",<br>    file = ":index.html",<br>    package = "assets",<br>)</span></pre><p id="16e5">This takes the <code>index.html </code>file:</p><pre><span id="5a54">&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br> &lt;!-- add stuff here --&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</span></pre><p id="4a53">and creates the <code>index.go</code> file:</p><pre><span id="e546">package assets<br>const INDEX_HTML string = `&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br> &lt;!-- add stuff here --&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;`</span></pre><p id="8cd7"><code>index.go</code> can be added to the <code>go_library</code> rule for the <code>assets</code> package:</p><pre><span id="f437">go_library(<br>    name = "go_default_library",<br>    srcs = [<br>        "assets.go",<br>        ":index.go",  # keep<br>    ],<br>    importpath = "github.com/.../assets",<br>)</span></pre><p id="1cbf">Now the <code>INDEX_HTML</code> constant is in the assets package.</p><p id="4aa6">It is straight forward for most the other files, but a bit more complicated for the WASM binary data:</p><pre><span id="758f">to_go_constant(<br>    name = "wasmbin",<br>    base64 = True,<br>    constant = "WASM_BIN",<br>    file = "//project/wasm",<br>    package = "assets",<br>)</span></pre><p id="cc54">The file <code>//project/wasm</code> refers to the generated <code>go_binary</code> rule that compiles the WASM (as described below). <code>base64</code> is also <code>True</code> so that the binary data can be encoded as a constant.</p><p id="6b53"><em>Note: There is one minor issue is the </em><code><em>wasm_exec.js</em></code><em> file, it has a few </em><code><em>`</em></code><em>’s in it that must be replaced.</em></p><h2 id="dede">The WASM part</h2><p id="406c">The WASM binary is the client-side GoLang application running in the browser. This example injects a <code>Hello World</code> <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag into the body:</p><pre><span id="a864">package main</span><span id="bd53">import (<br> "fmt"<br> "syscall/js"<br>)</span><span id="8acd">func main() {<br> fmt.Println("Hello World")</span><span id="b814"> document := js.Global().Get("document")<br> p := document.Call("createElement", "p")<br> p.Set("innerHTML", "Hello World")<br> document.Get("body").Call("appendChild", p)<br>}</span></pre><p id="7de3">The <code>go_binary</code> rule for this just needs <code>goos="js"</code> and <code>goarch="wasm"</code> for its output to be a WASM binary, e.g.:</p><pre><span id="d208">go_binary(<br>    name = "wasm",<br>    embed = [":go_default_library"],<br>    goarch = "wasm",<br>    goos = "js",<br>    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],<br>)</span></pre><p id="f178">The output of this rule is used to above to create the <code>WASM_BIN</code> constant above.</p><h2 id="71cd">Initializing the App</h2><p id="8bd2"><code>assets.INIT_JS</code> is built from <code>init.js:</code></p><pre><span id="7b05">loadWebASM = () =&gt; {<br> const go = new Go();<br> getWASM().then( (b64) =&gt; {<br>   // Decode and convert to ArrayBuffer<br>   buf = Uint8Array.from(atob(b64), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0)).buffer<br>   return WebAssembly.instantiate(buf, go.importObject)<br> }).then((result) =&gt; {<br>    go.run(result.instance);<br>  }).catch((err) =&gt; {<br>    console.error("loading wasm failed: " + err);<br>  });<br>}</span><span id="e6cf">loadWebASM()</span></pre><p id="c227">This code takes the <code>WASM_BIN</code> promised by <code>getWASM</code>, then decodes and converts it to an ArrayBuffer. This buffer is passed to the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly.instantiate</a></code> function that compiles and initializes the application to an <code>instance</code>, which is then <code>go.run</code>. <strong>This is the only JavaScript needed.</strong></p><h2 id="1f97">Pure GoLang Desktop App</h2><p id="29e8">The above code is all that is needed to now write pure(-ish) GoLang desktop applications. This also makes it easy to convert other WASM apps to desktop applications, e.g. I converted the WASM app at <a href="https://github.com/olivewind/go-webassembly-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/olivewind/go-webassembly-canvas</a> to a desktop application with minimal effort:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/998/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png" width="499" height="502" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/998/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png 499w" sizes="499px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="5c7c">Conclusion</h2><p id="80dd">There are many libraries and tools written in GoLang that could use a nice user interface, e.g. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker</a> (just off the top of my head). A web app does not fit their requirements very well since they are editing local files and talking to local daemons. The alternative is then to reimplement or bind their API and integrations to another language which is complicated, error prone and a lot of work. A method of building pure GoLang desktop applications makes a lot of sense for these kinds of tools.</p><p id="93db">This approach can pretty quickly create a distributable, single executable, desktop application with minimal external dependencies. An app that can reuse many GoLang libraries and tools that have already been built. I suppose the worst part of this approach is that it throws away years of development on JavaScript tools like React and Vue. But that just means I have to write more Go to reimplement them, so it isn’t that bad :)</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been
inspired by the writings of

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jmrphy" target="_blank">Justin Murphy</a> quit his academic career to research and teach on the internet full-time. Justin saw the University system as bloated and bureaucratic. He was frustrated with the paperwork and the politics. </p>



<p>Justin decided to leave his academic career as a professor to do what he planned in the first place – seek truth and communicate the best ideas into the world.</p>



<p>He felt that he could best achieve this goal by using the power of the internet. He is learning, experimenting, and growing like a Silicon Valley startup. But rather than taking on the legacy taxi or hotel business, Justin is taking on the University business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s working. Justin creates his own Teachable courses on topics he’s genuinely interested in. Driven students pay per course. In addition, he connects with people through books, podcasts, and his 16k Twitter followers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I spoke with Justin, he noted that he has created a philosophy course with <a href="https://twitter.com/nina__power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nina Power</a>, PhD. It’s called “<a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/bataille/?ref=linktree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Philosophy and Politics of Georges Bataille</a>.” A quote from one of his past students shows that Justin is tapping into something very interesting.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My thinking was challenged, exposed, and reshaped… Justin’s social network brings together rogue intellectuals, experimental musicians, martial arts teachers, conceptual artists and entrepreneurs from all over the globe. Collaborations have outlasted the length of the course.”</em> – Raven Connolly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The picture below is from his course and shows how Justin has built a classroom for himself.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gV-q5QlniNZKifQnI_uPRPJ48aZsBK4B79EVV8Vl7IM-LHJtTekCLAoUIk35hT62Vf8VEv6BlU88eNx4Xe4tFHqA22pVisfevfnHRDk8zrGtwJLt87k40_Yf9F8Gz2wQKMnGE-6Z" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Justin calls himself a “Full Stack Professor.” It’s a play on full stack developer – a software engineer who builds both the front and back ends of a website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Full Stack Professor handles all aspects of the professorship online and without the University. Research, publishing, bringing students together, creating classes, and building community is all part of the <em>stack</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I discussed <a href="http://makemymba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MyMBA</a> with Justin and what it means for students in addition to professors to break off from Universities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MyMBA brings business professionals together to create an MBA education for themselves at a fraction of the cost. Learn more here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://grantnissly.com/introducing-mymba/" target="_blank">Introducing MyMBA</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/grantnissly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyMBA-01.png?resize=229%2C138&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="229" height="138" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/grantnissly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyMBA-01.png?resize=1024%2C623&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/grantnissly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyMBA-01.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/grantnissly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyMBA-01.png?w=1198&amp;ssl=1 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>MyMBA Members take business classes online from top MBA programs, meet and collaborate with each other and business leaders, and create content on personal websites to prove their learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Justin inspired me to think of MyMBA in relation to his experience. In a way, MyMBA Members are creating the “Full Stack Business Student.” MyMBA Members strive to complete everything a traditional business student does using the resources of the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to the Full Stack Professor, a MyMBA Member believes that with deliberate effort, they can make the most of the infinite resources online and pave a way for themselves without the University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking it a step further, one can see Universities as a third party. They are the intermediary between students and professors or students and employers. Justin works without this third party by communicating directly to students. MyMBA works without this third party by communicating directly to employers.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my spare time (whenever I get to have some these days) I like to
poke around in the world of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>.</p>

<p>I do have some experience with various Lisp dialects such as Scheme,
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> and <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>,
so this is not my first introduction to the Lisp family. I’ve been
developing in Clojure at my current job and has also used Scheme
(<a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a> in particular) and Racket
in various small to mid-sized personal and hobby projects. Having
spent a fair amount of my time with the various Lisp dialects I
wouldn’t say that I’m expert in Lisp, not even close.</p>

<p>We are now in the 2020 year, and this is also the year that Lisp would
become 62 years old! That is an impressive age for a programming
language. With that said that does not mean that the concepts and
ideas developed in Lisp are old.</p>

<p>A thing so common for all languages these days such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E2%80%93then%E2%80%93else">if-then-else</a> was first
introduced by the creator of Lisp itself - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John
McCarthy</a>.
Another notable thing so common to lots of modern languages such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage
collection</a>
came from Lisp too. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">Read-Eval-Print-Loop
(REPL)</a> that most
of us cannot live without is another good example.</p>

<p>And these are just a few of the things that Lisp gave to the world.</p>

<p>These days Lisp isn’t very popular compared to other languages as it
used to be back in the days, but that isn’t to say that Lisp itself is
dead. As a matter of fact it is in a pretty good shape - various
Common Lisp implementations are actively being maintained – few days
ago <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL 2.0.0</a> got released
for example. Research and innovations are still happening in Racket
(check out the Honu project for instance), and Clojure is kicking
butts in the JVM world.</p>

<p>So, why spending time with Lisp you might ask?</p>

<p>Is it for the famous Lisp enlightenment everyone is talking about? I
don’t know, maybe. Personally, I find programming in Lisp quite fun.
Exploring stuff and poking around at the REPL in Common Lisp is a
whole different story than most of the REPLs you’ve dealt with.  Maybe
it is my personal curiousity about programming and computer science
that drove me to Lisp.</p>

<p>The language has a long history, so you would find lots of
reading materials, research papers and it’s fascinating to know that
you can still run such old code in modern Common Lisp implementations.</p>

<p>Have I been enlighted by Lisp? I don’t feel smarter after learning
Lisp. I do however feel that I’ve gained more experience as a
programmer. And maybe that’s the <em>Lisp enlightment</em> these old Lispers
talk about, maybe it’s something else. What I do know however is that
learning new paradigms and techniques definitely makes you a better
problem solver, so that’s another another reason to try learning some
Lisp.</p>

<p>Oh, and I <em>do</em> like the s-expr syntax. That for me is a good enough
reason to be excited about Lisp.</p>

<p>In this post I’m going to summarize my experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
Lisp</a> so far, and hopefully
the things I write here are going to be useful to someone else in
his/hers own journey in the world of Lisp.</p>

<p>I also need to mention that even though I have experience with Scheme
and Clojure, I’m quite new to Common Lisp. These being Lisp dialects
does not mean they are fully compatible with each other. Scheme takes
the functional-first approach to solving problems and Clojure is a
more modern reincarnation of Lisp which is closer to Scheme being a
Lisp-1 dialect, while Common Lisp is the ANSI standardized vision of
what Lisp should be.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that this post is not intended as a tutorial for all
things related to Lisp, but rather they document my particular
development setup and show various code samples which I’ve found
useful, and hopefully others will too.</p>

<p>At the end of this post you will also find additional references to
learning materials such as books and documentation, which I’d
recommend checking out. These references will be valuable to anyone
starting up with Common Lisp as they provide useful information and
insight.</p>

<h2 id="installing-common-lisp">Installing Common Lisp</h2>

<p>The nice thing about Common Lisp being ANSI standardized language is
that you can <a href="https://common-lisp.net/implementations">choose between various
implementations</a>.</p>

<p>You need high-performance Lisp compiler -
<a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL</a> has got you covered,
you need to use the JVM platform - <a href="https://abcl.org/">ABCL</a> is there
for you. You can check out the various Common Lisp implementations and
choose the one that suits you most. My personal choice has been SBCL,
but as long as you develop standard compliant code your project be
portable to any conforming implementation.</p>

<p>Installing SBCL on my Mac is as simple as the following command.</p>



<p>And when I’m working on my <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> system
I would install SBCL using the following command.</p>



<p>You would want to get a copy of the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Common Lisp
Hyperspec</a> as
well. On Macs you can install the HyperSpec using the following command.</p>



<p>Or you can grab the HyperSpec from
<a href="http://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec-7-0.tar.gz">here</a>
instead.</p>

<p>After installing SBCL you can test things up quickly in the REPL and
confirm everything has been installed properly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sbcl
This is SBCL 2.0.0, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

<p>Evaluating the following expression from the REPL would return
the Lisp implementation type and version.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>lisp-implementation-type</span><span>)</span>

<span>"SBCL"</span>
<span>"2.0.0"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="editor-setup">Editor setup</h2>

<p>I’ve been a long time Emacs user and for me the choice of editor
support for Common Lisp is simple -
<a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>.  Vim users would

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>One of the JavaScript concepts that most learners skip when studying the language is how JavaScript runs code on a single thread, and how it handles asynchronous tasks. By understanding the Call Stack and Event Loop, you'll learn how tasks are handled by the JavaScript engine, and hence, start writing non-blocking code.</p>
<p>Now, why should you care? Here are three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You get to understand how JavaScript works under the hood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It helps in debugging code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Based on my research, questions on the Event Loop and the Call Stack come up in interviews.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-are-stacks-and-queues-">What are Stacks and Queues?</h2>
<p>We'll be using two important terms in this article: <em>stack</em> and <em>queue</em>; so, it's necessary that I throw some light on them before the action starts.</p>
<p>A Stack and a Queue are data structures that are supported in most, if not all, programming languages. If you already know what they are feel free to skip this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-stack">A Stack</h3>
<p><em>In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and. pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shorturl.at/foruQ">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/stack_representation.jpg" alt="A Stack"></p>
<p>Take note of the text <strong>Last in - First out</strong> in the presentation above. Stacks use the <em>Last In, First Out</em> principle in managing a list (or array) of objects (elements), where the last item <strong>pushed</strong> onto the list is the first to be <strong>popped</strong> off. Makes sense?</p>
<p>A common example of a stack, is a pile of books:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NSMGzCL/stack-of-books.jpg" alt="A stack of books"></p>
<p>In order to add a new book to the pile of books, you put it on top, making it the last book; but in order to take the first one, Literature, you'd have to take off the last ones: Maths, History, Science.</p>
<p>So, the last item in the stack is the first to go out of it. That's the main idea behind the <em>stack</em> data structure.</p>
<h3 id="a-queue">A Queue</h3>
<p><em>In programming, a queue is a data structure in which elements are removed in the same order they were entered. This is often referred to as FIFO (first in, first out).</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Q/queue.html">Webopedia</a></p>
<p>Unlike stacks, a queue uses the <em>First In, First Out (FIFO)</em> principle when managing lists. In this case, the element or object which is first added to a list, is the first to go off the list.</p>
<p>A real-life example is a queue of people looking to meet the doctor at a hospital. The person who comes first sees the doctor first, right?</p>
<p>Queues have the idea of <em>first come, first serve</em>.</p>
<p>Since this isn't a data structures article, let's get to why we're really here.</p>

<p><em>In computer science, a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>To translate the above definition into JavaScript, "active subroutines" simple means "active functions" or "invoked (running) functions".</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the <strong>call stack</strong> is a single-threaded stack of function <em>invocations</em> in an active JavaScript program.</p>
<p>The call stack is basically a list of functions which have been invoked but aren't done running. The fact that it is single-threaded means only one thing is happening at a time.</p>
<p>Whenever we call a function (e.g. <code>funcA</code>), it gets pushed onto the stack as a <strong>stack frame</strong>. A stack frame is a memory location on the call stack.</p>
<p>So, if this particular function depends on another function (e.g. <code>funcB</code>), as in, it invokes <code>funcB</code> in its block, then <code>funcB</code> gets pushed onto the stack too, right on top of the function which invoked it; in this case <code>funcA</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>function</span> <span>funcB</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>"End of B"</span>;
}


<span><span>function</span> <span>funcA</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  
  <span>let</span> str = funcB();
}


funcA();
</code></pre>
<p>Now, here's a visual representation of how the JavaScript engine runs this script:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Cs6wj3L/call-stack-eg-1.png" alt="Representation of the call stack and the stack frames"></p>
<p>Okay, let's digest this.</p>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost, where the heck is the <code>main()</code> function coming from, and how did it get its own stack frame?
When a script (JavaScript code) is executed, the JavaScript engine creates a <strong>Global Execution Context</strong>, which is denoted by <code>global()</code> or <code>main()</code> function, which gets pushed onto the call stack. Thereby, becoming the first stack frame. We're not responsible for this; the JavaScript engine does this, so the Global Execution Context acts like an entry point for our JavaScript program.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the code we wrote, only <code>funcA()</code> was invoked globally (on the last line). This invocation creates a <strong>Function Execution Context</strong> for <code>funcA()</code> and pushes it onto the call stack, and it starts being executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <code>funcA()</code> function, <code>funcB()</code> is invoked - where its returned string is stored in the variable <code>str</code>. At this point, a <strong>Function Execution Context</strong> is created again for <code>funcB()</code> and a stack frame is created for it and gets pushed onto the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inside <code>funcB()</code>, every task (or code) is run until the last line (in our case, the <code>return</code> statement) which marks the end of the function. On this note, the function exits and is popped off the call stack. Since the call stack is a <strong>stack</strong> data structure, the last item goes out first (Last In, First Out). Therefore, <code>funcB()</code> is the first to be popped off the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When <code>funcB()</code> finishes executing, its returned value is obtained by <code>funcA()</code> which is stored in the <code>str</code> variable. And since the variable initialisation is the last line of <code>funcA()</code> it marks the end of the function, and hence causes the stack frame of <code>funcA()</code> to be popped off the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, since there are no more functions to be executed by the JavaScript engine, the Global Execution Context exits and <code>main()</code> or <code>global()</code> is popped off the call stack too, leaving it empty.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the image above isn't big enough just open it in a new tab and zoom in.</p>

<p>Before you get overly excited, this section isn't about the forum <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gyenabubakar.dev/www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> 😅.</p>
<p>There's a maximum number of stack frames that can occupy the call stack.</p>
<p>If this limit is exceeded, a stack overflow occurs. In other words, the JavaScript engine throws a <code>RangeError</code> exception (in Chrome), or <code>InternalError</code> exception (in Firefox).</p>
<p>But how could this ever happen?</p>
<p>A common way a stack overflow could occur is when a recursive function is executed without an exit condition.</p>
<p>A recursive function is any function which invokes itself in its definition block.</p>
<p>When such a function is invoked and no condition is provided for it to stop infinitely calling itself, the stack size limit is exceeded and a stack overflow occurs.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a recursive function which has no exit condition:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>example</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  
  example();
}


example();
</code></pre>
<p>Copy the code above and run it. Check the developer console and you'll see an error which looks like this (Chrome):</p>

<hr>
<p>I mentioned earlier that JavaScript is single-threaded, and that it runs one task at a time.</p>
<p>So, how does it handle asynchronous tasks?</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-tasks">Asynchronous Tasks</h2>
<p>JavaScript code is ran from top to bottom; tasks that are written first are executed first. However, this is different with asynchronous tasks.</p>
<p>Basically, asynchronous tasks are those that take some time before they complete. An example is fetching data from a remote server. Another instance is writing <code>setTimeout()</code> to invoke a function after a number of milliseconds.</p>
<p>Let's examine this code:</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>"start"</span>);


setTimeout(() =&gt; {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>"middle"</span>);
}, <span>1000</span>);

<span>console</span>.log(<span>"end"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>start</span>
<span>end</span>
middle
</code></pre><p>As you'd expect, the <code>setTimeout()</code> fired its callback after a second, but then clearly the browser skipped it and executed the <code>console.log()</code> at the end before coming to execute the callback in the <code>setTimeout()</code>.</p>
<p>How does that happen under the hood when we know JavaScript has one call stack and is single-threaded?</p>
<p>First of all, the first <code>console.log()</code> is pushed onto the call stack (after the global execution context, of course).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zVLLyky/e-loop-eg1.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>And after it logs to the console, its stack frame is popped off the call stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/RSkPPY5/e-loop-eg1b.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Then, the <code>setTimeout()</code> is pushed onto the call stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/HFPWPGd/e-loop-eg2.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Browsers come with their own APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), such as <code>setTimeout</code>, the DOM, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, etc. These APIs aren't provided by the JavaScript engine and hence, it doesn't know how it can execute such code. Therefore, the engine immediately marks it as complete (without running it), pops it off the call stack, and lets the browser or Web API handle it.</p>
<p>So, our <code>setTimeout()</code> is popped off the call stack so the Web API handles it, and then a timer is placed on its callback by the Web API.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NCbdjt4/e-loop-eg3.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>At that point, since it has been removed from the call stack, the JavaScript engine continues executing the code, and the last <code>console.log()</code> is pushed onto the call stack and executed, whilst the <code>setTimeout()</code> callback is being handled by the Web API.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YPmtKbW/e-loop-eg4.png" alt="example"></p>

<p>The moment the provided time on the <code>setTimeout()</code> expires, in this case 1 second, the callback is pushed onto the <strong>Callback Queue</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xCZyMPD/e-loop-eg5.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>And obviously, by now, the last <code>console.log()</code> had already been executed and popped off the call stack, meaning the script is done running.</p>

<p>Remember what the <em>queue</em> data structure is?</p>
<p>The <strong>Callback Queue</strong> is a first-in-first-out data structure. Meaning, the first function which it takes is the first to go out of it.</p>
<p>Why didn't the Web API push the callback function directly onto the call stack? The reason is that, by the time the timer on the callback expires, the call stack may be busy executing functions.</p>
<p>So, the asynchronous code is enqueued on the Callback Queue, waiting to be pushed onto the call stack by the <em>event loop</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>event loop</em> is an endless loop which has only one goal: push tasks (from the callback queue) onto the call stack when the call stack is done running the script.</p>
<p>The <em>event loop</em> keeps checking both the call stack and callback queue; if the call stack is empty, it checks if there are any queued tasks on the callback queue. If there are any, it pushes them onto the call stack.</p>
<p>So, now that the JavaScript engine is done executing code and the call stack is left with no more code or functions to execute, the event loop takes the callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack to be executed.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GQbNmPz/e-loop-eg6.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>The callback is ran, and the engine notices it calls <code>console.log()</code>. It takes that and …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">Seam carving</a> is a technique
for <em>content-aware resizing</em>, which changes the size of an image while
attempting to preserve the interesting content of the image. The basic
idea behind the technique is to remove <strong><em>low-energy seams</em></strong>: paths of pixels
that are similar to their surroundings. A removed seam can be either vertical or
horizontal, to reduce either the width or height of an image.</p>

<p>For example, here’s a panorama I took a few years ago near Spruce Knob, WV.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/pano.jpg"></p>

<p>The image is super wide, but we can carve it down.
Here’s an animation of the process, generated by the
<a href="https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl/pull/123">seam-carver I implemented recently</a>
as a parallel benchmark for
<a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>.</p>

<p>Getting real parallel speedups in this implementation turned out to be an
interesting challenge. For typical images, which are fairly small,
I found that the most obvious approach for parallelizing the algorithm was not
able to extract enough parallelism, because it required too small of a
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">grain size</a></em>.
So, I designed a new way of parallelizing the algorithm which works much
better on small images. This post presents some of the details.</p>

<h2 id="the-seam-carving-algorithm">The Seam Carving Algorithm</h2>

<p>The idea behind seam-carving is to consider all possible seams in an image,
select the one which is least important, and remove it. A <strong><em>seam</em></strong> is a path of
pixels that cuts across an image, touching one pixel in each row (or column)
along the way. When we remove a seam, we reduce either the width or height
of the image by 1. We can repeat this process as many times as desired to
shrink the image.</p>

<p>We’ll base the “importance” of seams on a notion of pixel <strong><em>energy</em></strong>, which
can be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient">many different ways</a>.
For seam-carving, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference">color difference</a> gradient
seems to work well, which measures how different a pixel’s color is in
comparison to its surroundings. The <strong><em>energy of a seam</em></strong> is just the
cumulative energies of all pixels touched by the seam. With this setup,
the seam with <em>minimum energy</em> should be unimportant and safe to remove from
an image.</p>

<p>To compute <em>minimum seam energies</em>, we can use a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>
algorithm. For simplicity here, let’s focus on vertical seams. Let
\(M(i,j)\) be the minimum energy of
any partial seam that ends at row \(i\) and column \(j\), and let
\(E(i,j)\) be the energy of the pixel at that position. These minimum seam
energies are related by the following equation:</p><p>

\[M(i,j) = E(i,j) + \min(M(i-1,j-1), M(i-1,j), M(i-1,j+1))\]

</p><p>A picture might help. For each position, we look at the minimum partial
seams that end above it, pick the smallest, and then add the next pixel.</p>

<p><img width="250px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/equation.svg"></p>

<p>Once \(M\) has been fully computed, we can find the minimum overall seam by
working backwards, from bottom to top, by walking upwards along the path of
minimum seam energies starting at the smallest in the bottommost row.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-minimum-seam-in-parallel">Finding the minimum seam in parallel</h2>



<p>The dependencies within the equation for \(M\) appear to offer a lot of
parallelism. Perhaps the most immediately obvious approach is to compute
\(M\) in <strong><em>row-major</em></strong> order,
where first we do all of row 0, and then all of row 1, etc. With this ordering,
the values within a row can be computed entirely in parallel, because each
\(M(i, j)\) only depends on three values \(M(i-1, \ldots)\) from the previous row.</p>

<p>However, there’s a major problem in practice with row-major order:
typical images are only at most a few thousand pixels wide, and each pixel
only requires a small amount of work. That’s not enough work (per row)
to parallelize effectively! We’ll need a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">granularity</a>
of at least, say, a thousand pixels to amortize the cost of parallelism itself.</p>

<p>This pretty much rules out using row-major order for typical, small images.
Is there a better to compute \(M\) without reducing the grain size?</p>



<p>To extract more parallelism without reducing the grain size, we need a
better way to partition up the work. This is something that probably
<em>could</em> be done “automatically” (e.g. take a look at
<a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/c/Chowdhury:Rezaul_Alam.html">Rezaul Chowdhury</a>’s
work), but here we’ll just try to design something ourselves.</p>

<p>What are all of the dependencies for a single value \(M(i,j)\)? Visually,
the dependencies form a triangle with the pointy-end pointing down:</p>

<p><img width="300px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/depend.svg"></p>

<p>We can use triangles like these to split up the work in a nice way. First,
imagine grouping adjacent rows into <strong><em>strips</em></strong>. Within one strip,
cover the top of the strip with a bunch downward-pointing triangles. The
leftover space will look like a bunch of upward-pointing triangles, each
of which has all of its dependencies already satisfied (this is not immediately
obvious but drawing a picture will help). So, we
can process one strip in two parallel rounds, where first we do a bunch of
downward-pointing triangles in parallel, and then we do a bunch of
upward-pointing triangles to fill in the leftover space.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture using triangles that are 6 pixels wide at the base. Note that
if we use triangles of even base-width, then these tile naturally with no
overlap.</p>

<p><img width="350px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/strips.svg"></p>

<p>How wide should each triangle be in practice? Recall that we’re shooting for a
target granularity of maybe one or two thousand pixels. This corresponds to
triangles with base-widths of somewhere between 64 (1056 pixels in the triangle)
and 90 (2070 pixels in the triangle).</p>

<p>So, in a smallish image, e.g. 1000 pixels wide, we can fit
at least 11 triangles horizontally, suggesting a maximum possible
speedup of 11x or more. This is a big improvement over the row-major strategy,
which (using a granularity of 1000 pixels) would not be able to extract any
parallelism from such an image.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-and-performance">Implementation and performance</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>, I implemented both the row-major
and triangular strategies to compare their performance. The code for the
triangular strategy is available in the <code>examples/src/seam-carve/</code> subdirectory
of the <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a> repo. I’ll leave the row-major
code as an exercise to the reader. (It’s not too bad!)</p>

<p>Here are some performance numbers for
removing 10 seams from an image of size approximately 2600x600. I did a little
bit of tuning, and ended up choosing a row-major granularity of 1000 pixels,
and a triangular base-width granularity of 88 (1980 pixels).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Strategy</th>
      <th>P = 1</th>
      <th>P = 10</th>
      <th>P = 20</th>
      <th>P = 30</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>row-major</td>
      <td>0.66</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>triangular</td>
      <td>0.78</td>
      <td>0.17</td>
      <td>0.12</td>
      <td>0.09</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On 1 processor (P = 1), the row-major strategy is faster by about 15%, but
on more processors quickly hits a maximum speedup of about 2x, seeing no
additional improvement above 10 processors.
In contrast, the triangular strategy continues to get faster as the number
of processors increases, with self-speedups of about 5x on 10 processors,
6.5x on 20, and 9x on 30.</p>

<p>Despite having a mild amount of overhead on 1 processor, we can see that
the triangular strategy provides significant gains. On higher core counts,
it is as much as 4x faster than the row-major strategy.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>One might wonder: why are the speedups we got so far away from theoretical
limits? With a base-width of 88, shouldn’t we be able to get up to 30x speedup
on an image of width 2600? Well, unfortunately, there are a large number of
barriers to achieving such good speedup in practice: ineffective cache
utilization, memory bandwidth bottlenecks, non-optimal scheduling… and
many more.</p>

<p>In the case of seam carving, there are two major limiting factors.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Seam carving is largely memory-bound, i.e., for each memory access it
  only does a small amount of work before the next access. To get around this
  bottleneck, we might need better cache utilization, and so we would have to
  more carefully lay out the values of \(M(i,j)\) in memory. (For this
  implementation, I used a simple flat-array layout, where \(M(i,j)\) lives at
  index \(iW + j\). We could instead try storing these values in a
  hierarchical structure, indexing first by strip, and then by triangle, to
  better improve locality.)</li>
  <li>Seam carving has high span, performing a small amount of work in
  between each synchronization. For example in the row-major strategy, we use
  a barrier between each row, and in the triangular strategy, we use two
  barriers per strip. This can cause the scheduler to perform too many thread
  migrations. To mitigate this, one thing we could try is to let triangles
  overlap slightly, to increase the size of each strip. This trades a small
  amount of duplicated work for fewer barrier synchronizations overall, which
  could prove to be hugely beneficial.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--  end .author-box-single --> <!-- excerpt --> <!-- advertisement --> <!-- entry content --><p>Zimbabwean Lives Matter, a movement born as a result of the suffering of the country’s citizens has been an example of a successful social media campaign with over 1.5 million tweets, likes, shares and retweets going out. It <span>is a citizen movement against the Zimbabwean government which has been abducting and torturing people protesting against corruption and looting.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Education Support Forum (TEDSF), a Pan-African Non-Governmental Organisation has taken it upon itself to use the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter (ZLM) campaign to highlight a serious deficiency on the African continent.</p><p>Africa is still not telling her stories as a continent. The experiences of Africans in good and bad times are not as well documented as their Western and Eastern peers. African stories are still being told by foreigners.</p><p>We have to develop mechanisms to share our experiences with the world. African universities and governments ought to be leading the efforts for multi-modal information gathering and distribution. Currently, most of our African societies still rely too much on oral tradition, a very ineffective way of passing down information. The distortion over time is inevitable.</p><p>TEDSF&nbsp; has created a <a href="https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/"><strong>platform</strong></a> to capture the experiences of Zimbabweans during their ZLM struggle. A digital repository that seeks to preserve and make accessible original content that was captured and created by individual community members, grassroots organizations, and witnesses to the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter movement. <span>It aims to raise awareness of these injustices so as to pave a way for sustainable change in the ailing country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>On the platform people can <a href="https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/contribution">share their experiences</a> through the following modalities:</p><ul><li><strong>Text</strong> – A resource consisting primarily of words for reading. Examples include books, letters, dissertations, poems, newspapers, articles, archives of mailing lists. Note that facsimiles or images of texts are still of the genre Text.</li><li><strong>Moving image</strong> – A series of visual representations imparting an impression of motion when shown in succession. Examples include animations, movies, television programs, videos, zoetropes, or visual output from a simulation.</li><li><strong>Oral History</strong> – A resource containing historical information obtained in interviews with persons having firsthand knowledge.</li><li><strong>Sound/Music</strong> – A resource primarily intended to be heard. Examples include a music playback file format, an audio compact disc, and recorded speech or sounds.</li><li><strong>Still Image</strong> – A static visual representation. Examples include paintings, drawings, graphic designs, plans and maps. Recommended best practice is to assign the type Text to images of textual materials.</li><li><strong>Website –</strong> A resource comprising of a web page or web pages and all related assets ( such as images, sound and video files, etc. ).</li><li><strong>Event</strong> – A non-persistent, time-based occurrence. Metadata for an event provides descriptive information that is the basis for discovery of the purpose, location, duration, and responsible agents associated with an event. Examples include an exhibition, webcast, conference, workshop, open day, performance, battle, trial, wedding, tea party, conflagration.</li><li><strong>Email</strong> – A resource containing textual messages and binary attachments sent electronically from one person to another or one person to many people.</li><li><strong>Lesson Plan</strong> – A resource that gives a detailed description of a course of instruction.</li><li><strong>Hyperlink</strong> – A resource that gives a detailed description of a course of instruction.</li><li><strong>Person</strong> – An individual.</li><li><strong>Interactive Resource</strong> – A resource requiring interaction from the user to be understood, executed, or experienced. Examples include forms on Web pages, applets, multimedia learning objects, chat services, or virtual reality environments.</li><li><strong>Dataset</strong> – Data encoded in a defined structure. Examples include lists, tables, and databases. A dataset may be useful for direct machine processing.</li><li><strong>Physical Object</strong> – An inanimate, three-dimensional object or substance. Note that digital representations of, or surrogates for, these objects should use Moving Image, Still Image, Text or one of the other types.</li><li><strong>Service</strong> – A system that provides one or more functions. Examples include a photocopying service, a banking service, an authentication service, interlibrary loans, a Z39.50 or Web server.</li><li><strong>Software</strong> – A computer program in source or compiled form. Examples include a C source file, MS-Windows .exe executable, or Perl script.</li></ul><p>The information collected can be used by academics and analysts in the future. You can help by sharing your experiences, anonymously, so you don’t have to worry about your safety. Your identity will only be revealed if you so choose. <a href="https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/contribution">https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/contribution</a></p><div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2020-08-11"><div id="review-box"><p><span><h5>Relevance - 100%</h5><span data-width="100"></span></span></p><p><span><h5>Accuracy - 100%</h5><span data-width="100"></span></span></p><p><span><h5>Clarity - 100%</h5><span data-width="100"></span></span></p><div><p><span><strong>User Rating: </strong> <span>5</span> <small>( <span>1</span> votes)</small> </span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="#" id="zilla-likes-27816" title="Like this"><span>1</span> <span></span></a></p><br> <!-- Categories & Tags --><div id="tabs_wrapper"><div id="tabs_content_container"><div id="tab2"><div><p><a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/africa/" rel="tag">africa</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/emails/" rel="tag">emails</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/history/" rel="tag">history</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/metadata/" rel="tag">metadata</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/photos/" rel="tag">photos</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/share/" rel="tag">share</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/sories/" rel="tag">sories</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/tedsf/" rel="tag">tedsf</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/videos/" rel="tag">videos</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/zimbabwean-lives-matter/" rel="tag">zimbabwean lives matter</a> <span>,</span> <a href="https://tedsf.org/tag/zlm/" rel="tag">zlm</a></p></div></div></div></div> <!-- Related Articles & Author --></div></div>]]>

						<p>SpaceX wants to transform the Boca Chica Village in Texas into a modern spaceport, according to a new <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/4816599002?gh_jid=4816599002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing</a> for “Resort Development Manager” posted this week. Spotted by CNBC reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1292913032042086401">Michael Sheetz</a>, the job description states that “SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport.”</p>
<p>Boca Chica is the small area near Brownsville, Texas, where SpaceX already conducts tests with the Starship project — which aims to deliver new spacecrafts designed to take passengers beyond low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>According to the job description for the SpaceX Brownsville facility, the company wants to turn the entire region into a spaceport to accommodate both the people and cargo that will be on board the Starship vehicle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SpaceX is committed to developing revolutionary space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets. Boca Chica Village is our latest launch site dedicated to Starship, our next generation launch vehicle. SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport. We are looking for a talented Resort Development Manager to oversee the development of SpaceX’s first resort from inception to completion.&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Resort Development Manager will be responsible for managing the entire project, including design and architectural aspects, costs, schedules, and all government approvals.</p>

<p>With so much effort on this project, SpaceX clearly wants to offer a unique experience for those planning to travel to the Moon or even Mars.</p>

<p>Bad decision-makers who make quick decisions get themselves in a lot of trouble. They need to slow down and be more thoughtful.</p>



<p>Bad decision-makers who make slow and thoughtful decisions are still bad decision-makers. They need to make better decisions.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who makes slow and thoughtful decisions do well for themselves but they waste time and endure unnecessary stress due to indecision. They need to be more decisive.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who make quick decisions are great decision-makers. They trust their good judgement and make the most good decisions.</p>

The Agile approach in data science is based on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">its twelve principles</a> (you can click on the anchor texts to find out what they are if you don’t know).</p><p>According to Christos, a data scientist’s role in an Agile team is to experiment and learn what works and what doesn’t. Agile Software Development is all about creating experiments, not tasks. Experimentation tolerates failure as education.</p><blockquote><p>“If practicing Agile Software Development produces value from learning through failing fast and safe… then a Data Scientist’s role in an Agile team is to help the team to fail faster!”</p><cite><a href="https://2018.mcubed.london/sessions/data-science-agile-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christos Hadjinikolis at Mcubed London 2018</a>.</cite></blockquote><p>When we do an experiment, we start by forming a hypothesis and determining the variables. Then, we proceed to collect and analyse data based on those variables.</p><p>When the results are not what we wanted or expected, it shows that the hypothesis doesn’t work or there’s not enough data to test this hypothesis. So, we adjust the hypothesis and redo the experiment to see if that hypothesis works or not.</p><h3 id="1-story-splitting">Story splitting</h3><p>In Agile, a use case is split into different user stories. A user story is an explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end-user. A user would describe the functionality they want in a feature and the benefit gained from that functionality.</p><p>Here’s an example we came up with. In a non-tech use case of baking the town’s best range of cupcakes, a user would say in a user story, “As a <em>cupcake seller</em>, I want <em>more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter</em>, so that <em>the cupcakes will be tastier</em> <em>for cupcake eaters</em>.”</p><p>In this user story, the “cupcake seller” is the description of the user, “more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter” is the functionality requested and “the cupcakes will be tastier for cupcake eaters” is the benefit of the functionality.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" alt="Putting cupcake batter into the cupcake mold." srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w"><figcaption>Hypothesis testing can be applied to making a good cupcake batter for delicious cupcakes.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/baking-cupcakes-cake-batter-4020041/" target="_blank">Alice_Engelbrink</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The baker would test the hypothesis that more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter would result in tastier cupcakes. The baker would experiment with several batches of cupcake batters with different amounts of vanilla essence, and then, record the data to analyse if more or less vanilla essence is better.</p><p>The baker would repeat experiments for other user stories about other cupcake features like the amounts of sugar, flour, ground flaxseed, water, colouring, oven temperature, flavouring and icing.</p><p>The same can be done in software development. Let’s look at it from the lens of a customer service colleague who is logging an issue about an online shopping app feature as a user story in the use case of improving the online shopping app.</p><p>This user would say, “As a <em>customer service representative</em>, I want <em>the</em> <em>quantity of items in the shopping cart to be changeable</em>, so that <em>the customers can buy more than one of the same product</em>“.</p><p>The software developer would then experiment with hypothetical ways to enable the quantity of items to change from 0 or 1 to the maximum number in stock.</p><hr><h2 id="2-agile-cuts-time-consuming-planning-and-speeds-up-turnaround-of-projects">Agile cuts time-consuming planning and speeds up turnaround of projects</h2><p>Frameworks based on Agile including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Feature-Driven Development and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) may emulate the adaptivity encouraged by Agile Software Development.</p><p>But they don’t necessarily have to be followed if they don’t necessarily meet the needs of failing faster, getting results faster and deploying software faster to give value to the customer faster.</p><p>That’s the beauty of the Agile approach. Nothing has to be concrete from the start and adjustments can be made along the way. Especially when there’s uncertainty about data availability, no time is wasted on excessive planning and documentation, and instead, more time is spent on pleasing the end-user.</p><h3 id="3-data-science-specific-practices-based-on-agile-values-will-eventually-be-developed-in-research">Data Science-specific practices based on Agile Values will eventually be developed in research</h3><p>Christos commented that the emergence of new Data Science-oriented practices will drive the application of Agile in the research domain.</p><p>“The focus there is about delivering business requirements, in the form of features and products, fast in a volatile, constantly evolving environment.”</p><p>“To support this, a number of underpinning practices have been developed, covering areas like modelling and design, coding and testing, risk handling and quality assurance.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Some of these underpinning practices can directly be transferred in the Data Science world (e.g. user stories and backlogs, timeboxing and retrospectives).”</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1596795332" alt="Waterfall vs Agile Process" srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1597029378 1024w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-300x225.jpg?v=1597029378 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-768x576.jpg?v=1597029378 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1536x1152.jpg?v=1597029378 1536w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o.jpg?v=1597029378 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1596795332" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1597029378 1024w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-300x225.jpg?v=1597029378 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-768x576.jpg?v=1597029378 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1536x1152.jpg?v=1597029378 1536w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o.jpg?v=1597029378 1728w"><figcaption>Christos said that, for data scientists, Agile is mostly about adjusting to the requirement of working in a way to deliver business value from their experimentation.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/visualpunch/8746306184/in/photostream/" target="_blank">visualpun.ch</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>“So, a clear benefit of trying to apply Agile in Data Science is that gradually, similar Data Science-specific underpinning practices will eventually be developed and these will, of course, be based on the same Agile drives: adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery and continual improvement, and more generally, flexible responses to change.”</p><hr><h2 id="4-the-downsides-of-the-agile-approach-in-data-science">The downsides of the Agile approach in data science</h2><p>However, Agile may not work for everyone and for every situation.

There are surely research projects as well as business requirements around the delivery of software that could potentially be delivered through the Waterfall approach or maybe through a combination of the two.”</p><p>To this, he recommended that project managers and teams should strive to increase their effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>“If that can be done by building on top of the Agile values then great; if not, then maybe they will need to try and come up with a different formula.”</p><blockquote><p>“People focusing too much on what Agile is and what is not—if it needs to be Scrum or Kanban or if too much documentation or too much time spent in design is not Agile—are bound to make mistakes.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3 id="5-the-agile-industrial-complex">The Agile Industrial Complex</h3><p>He also agreed that the imposition of Agile on teams, i.e. The Agile Industrial Complex, is defeating the purpose of Agile in finding what works best for teams in working adaptively.</p><p>“Once more, I can’t stress enough how there is no single perfect development model. Project managers need to always assess what is fit for purpose.”</p><p>“Primarily though, they should focus on the underpinning values and principles that Agile or other development models are characterised by. When they do, a recurrent mistake that I have experienced through my consulting career is the oversimplification of Agile as an anti-methodology, anti-documentation and anti-planning development model.”</p><p>“I appreciate that this makes understanding Agile much easier, but at the same time it is a very unfair representation of what Agile is! Imposing it on this basis is surely wrong. Equally, practicing Agile is definitely not something that comes through imposition.”</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/agile-mindset.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/agile-mindset.jpg?v=1597029111 495w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/agile-mindset-300x168.jpg?v=1597029111 300w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/agile-mindset.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/agile-mindset.jpg?v=1597029111 495w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/agile-mindset-300x168.jpg?v=1597029111 300w"><figcaption>Project managers and teams need to understand that the Agile approach in data science is all about applying the Agile mindset instead of imposing an Agile model.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/death-agile-beyond/" target="_blank">InfoQ</a></figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="6-many-data-scientists-are-not-aware-of-the-agile-manifesto">Many data scientists are not aware of the Agile manifesto</h3><p>Another sad thing is that, when Christos asked the attendees, who were mostly data scientists, at his Mcubed London 2018 session to raise their hands if they knew about the Agile Manifesto, very few hands were seen.

<p>I <a href="https://reeve.blog/blog/principles/">recently argued</a> that 80% of a product manager’s job is to discover the right product to build and drive organizational alignment. At the same time, ‘product discovery’ is often the most nebulous part of the job. So how&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;great product managers do this? While product discovery will never be easy, I’ll outline a simple yet effective framework that I use.</p>



<p>There are many great books about product discovery. They also tend to be complicated and tricky to reference day-to-day. So over time, I’ve tried to simplify this, and I’ve distilled it down into what I call the “Five P’s.” In my experience, all five have to be defined and considered when deciding what to build:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the mission of your company or product?</li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>What is the customer or user problem we’re solving?</li><li><strong>Pattern:</strong> How many people are impacted by this problem?</li><li><strong>Prose: </strong>What is the narrative for how solving this problem benefits the customer and our business?</li><li><strong>Priority: </strong>How important is this solving this problem vs. other problems on which we could focus?</li></ul>







<p>Your purpose is why your company or product exists, reflected as a mission and strategy. Without this, you’re flying blind. There’s no use in identifying the auto industry’s most common problems if your mission is to create the world’s leading crypto bank:</p>



<ol><li>A <strong>mission</strong> statement is what you’re trying to accomplish. E.g., <em>Plant a billion trees on each continent to offset the world’s carbon emissions. </em>A mission statement should be concise, opinionated, inspiring, and action-oriented (i.e., begin with a verb.)</li><li>A <strong>strategy</strong> is how you’re going to achieve your mission. E.g., <em>Identify suitable land, build irrigation systems, procure seeds and fertilizer, sow seeds by helicopter.</em></li><li><strong>Vision</strong> and mission are easily confused. Think of vision as defining what the world will look like when you’ve achieved your mission.<em> </em>E.g., <em>we’ve offset the world’s carbon emissions by 30%, providing cleaner air to billions of people.</em></li></ol>



<p>Investing time in defining a purpose may seem abstract. Still, it’s critical: Having a clear and compelling mission and strategy inspires a product team and points discovery efforts in the right direction. For product “tracks” within larger companies, the track’s purpose should contribute to the company’s purpose. Boz (VP at Facebook) wrote a great article on mission and strategy <a href="https://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics">here</a>.</p>







<p>The core part of effective product management is identifying pain within the context of your mission and strategy. What problems do your target customers have? Why do people like or not like your product? Are your customers asking for something?</p>



<p>Problems can surface qualitatively or quantitatively:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> This might include user experience research, a customer call series, feature requests from users, input from your team or stakeholders, competitor research, or your own product judgment. To paraphrase <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablue/">Allen Blue</a>, look for places where your target customers are already “duct-taping” things together.</li><li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> What you’ve identified through studying trends in your metrics. Product managers should study their metrics daily to understand how the product is performing and identify problems and opportunities.</li></ul>



<p>Customers will often tell you the solution, not the problem. They’re trying to be helpful. But well-intentioned customers usually don’t know what’s possible, nor what will work best for your product. Asking the right questions can help identify the problem:</p>



<ul><li>If you get X, what will it help you do?</li><li>What happens if you don’t get X?</li><li>If you don’t get X, how will you achieve Y?</li></ul>



<p>Be careful in situations where there’s a “layer” between you and the user. Suppose the person you’re talking with is an intermediary (e.g., the buyer or someone who administers the product within a company): In this scenario, they may not understand the experience from the end user’s perspective. Be mindful of who is answering your questions.</p>



<p>Finally, while many formal research functions support the discovery process (product marketing, user research, etc.), a deep understanding of the customer can’t be delegated to another function. Great product managers have strong opinions and intuition; this comes from being exposed to raw feedback, e.g., attending customer calls, studying metrics, and talking to users.</p>







<p>Most of the time, product managers are looking for systemic issues that impact a large percentage of your target customers. We can define ‘systemic’ in different ways: The number of customers with a problem, the value of the customers who have the problem (e.g., how much they spend with you), or whether they are uniquely significant (e.g., a prominent “brand name”).</p>



<p>There are going to be situations where solving an isolated problem is the right call. You might choose to build something purely because a critical customer is asking for it. You might prioritize something for a small but essential cohort of users (e.g., power users or promoters). These are fine, but they should be the exception, not the norm.</p>







<p>The word ‘prose’ underscores the importance of looking beyond a singular metric. Don’t get me wrong, moving metrics is crucial, and I spend a lot of time doing just that, but they aren’t exhaustive. Too often, I see product teams focusing on tuning a singular metric without considering the entire ecosystem or whether something is the right long-term investment as part of a broader mission and strategy. </p>



<p>Even worse, product teams may shy away from building a great product because they can’t predict the quantitative impact of building it. <strong>In practice, you often won’t be able to accurately predict the metric impact of shipping a brand new product or making a step-function change.</strong> </p>



<p>Persuasive prose forces product teams to consider both the quantitative and qualitative effects of building something <em>and</em> how it ties to a broader mission and strategy. It underscores the value of having a clear and compelling narrative for understanding:</p>



<ol><li>What the problem is.</li><li>Why the problem should be solved.</li><li>How the problem will be solved.</li><li>The qualitative and quantitative impact of solving the problem.</li><li>How solving the problem contributes to a broader mission and strategy.</li></ol>



<p><strong>I’ll touch on the two main tools I use when working with ‘prose’:</strong></p>



<p><strong>The first you’re probably familiar with, which is the hypothetical external press release, </strong><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html"><strong>popularized by Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The press release explains what the product is, why it exists, and the features and benefits. It’s a compelling articulation of the value that the product delivers to the customer and the market. If it isn’t compelling, you may either not be solving the right problem, or not have the right product to solve it.</p>



<p><strong>But I’m guessing you haven’t heard of the second application of ‘prose’:</strong> The concept is similar, but it’s an <em>internal</em><strong><em> </em></strong>press release. Imagine you’re summarizing the “why,” “what,” and “how” to your CEO. Articulate the problem you’re solving, how it ties to broader mission and strategy, how you’re going to solve it, and the impact that solving it will have on your business. This internal press release will narrate what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and support it with qualitative and quantitative data. And yes, for any significant decision, you should share it! This exercise identifies incongruencies in your logic, and it will also help communicate the value of doing something.</p>







<p>Prioritization is conceptually simple. In practice, it’s harder and often imprecise, a mixture of art and science. Usually, it’s about the cost versus benefit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>First, we want to understand the impact of solving a problem:</strong> How much will it move a given metric? How many customers have asked for this? Will this increase retention? Will it unlock a portion of the market?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Second, we need to have a sense of how much solving it will cost:</strong> How many engineering weeks are required to build the solution? What are the support and marketing costs?</li></ul>



<p>There are many prioritization frameworks, including <a href="https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15">ICE</a>, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/">RICE, and many others</a>. Still, I’ve found that they often miss the need for product teams to balance multiple distinct success metrics and “themes” of work. I’ve had success with a slightly augmented version of ICE that I’ve eloquently named <strong>MICE</strong> (Metric, Impact, Confidence, Ease.)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metric: </strong>What is the importance of the metric that this feature will move? E.g., do we care more about improving activation, or more about retention?</li><li><strong>Impact: </strong>What is the impact of solving this problem based on the pattern you’ve identified?</li><li><strong>Confidence: </strong>What is our confidence in this impact?</li><li><strong>Ease: </strong>How easy is this problem to solve? (An inverse of cost, higher is cheaper.)</li><li>Multiply M*I*C*E, and sort from highest to lowest.</li></ul>



<p>A prioritization framework will give you a way of loosely sorting what you <em>could</em> work on, but it’s a supplement for judgment, not a replacement. “Because the framework said so” isn’t a valid reason for prioritizing something. Prioritization is always a balancing act between data, intuition, and stakeholder alignment.</p>



<p>Always remember that teams are comprised of people, and people are better when they aren’t stretched thin across multiple contexts. Set a theme for the quarter (e.g., we’re going to nail this particular customer type or user persona), and focus on making material progress within that theme, instead of trying to solve a dozen problems for a dozen different customer segments. Great focus yields great results.</p>







<p>Someday, I’ll write a longer piece about driving organizational alignment (which is just a fancy way of saying “getting people to agree that this is the right thing to build”). Still, it’s so important that this article wouldn’t be complete without touching on it.</p>

<p><em>This article was published in The Seybold Report Volume 30 Number 6, November 2000. It was a strange time when QuickDraw GX 3rd party developments like Japanese stroke fonts and plug-in font scalers were up in the air without a clear migration path to the newly announced MacOS X ATSUI Carbon framework, OpenType Japanese fonts and InDesign J had been announced but were months away from shipping, and Japanese print customers were angry with Adobe and Morisawa for forcing font upgrades on everybody. It’s a snapshot of Japanese publishing in transition as Steve Jobs was saving Apple and tossing the Japanese print market a few morsels like extended Japanese glyph sets, Adobe was caught flat footed and was furious with Apple.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>Japanese DTP arrived with Apple’s NTX-J PostScript printer and Linotype’s first Japanese PostScript imagesetter in 1989. They came at the right time: The early- ’90s economy was bubbling, companies had money to burn and Japanese DTP took off. It was a young, booming market and it forgave many mistakes that would haunt the industry later.</p>



<p>By 1996, the go-go days were gone and they would not come back. By this time, DTP tools (Quark Xpress, Illustrator, Photoshop and, to a smaller extent, PageMaker) had captured nearly 40 percent of the production process. For a conservative industry like Japanese publishing, this was phenomenal―until compared to the West. There, in the same amount of time, practically the entire industry converted to DTP production. Japan is still about 40 percent and holding.</p>



<p>What happened? Three things: the economy, the failure of Western technology to address Japanese issues, and the same old cultural differences Westerners have been running into since Commodore Perry knocked down the doors in 1853. They just do things differently here, get used to it.</p>



<p>The economic crunch hit the publishing market hard, and it hasn’t really recovered. Consider the book and magazine market: On average, this year’s revenues are down 3.4 percent over last year.</p>

<p>Basically, the publishing industry overextended itself in the bubble years of the early ’90s and is still adjusting.</p>



<p>Some of the difficulty is the publication distribution structure. Anybody in the business will tell you there just isn’t enough shelf space and return rates are climbing. Internet publishing is not much of a factor yet. Japanese book retail laws, which prohibit stores from selling below suggested retail prices, will be relaxed soon and will put tremendous pressure on the current price structure, which supports lots of marginally profitable items</p>



<p>The Japanese market is also a highly segmented one. There are the major newspapers, which have very specialized workflow systems and in-house fonts. There is the book industry, which runs the gamut from standard tanko bon hardbacks to the ingenious, very popular pocket-size bunko hon paperbacks (which really have no equal in the West). There are lots of printers, using both DTP and traditional systems, that cover everything in-between. In a class of their own are manga: the hefty weekly comic books you can find on subway luggage racks, left there by salarymen too embarrassed to take them home.</p>

<p>On the whole, the industry is still in a slump and has been treading water for the last few years, with relatively little investment in new technologies such as computer-to-plate. At the same time, competition and consolidation in the printing sector have forced prices down-more than 30 percent in the past year alone-so there is a great need to reduce production costs and increase efficiency. This is the great challenge of the Japanese publishing industry. Meeting it will require new investment in hardware and software. The challenge for vendors is to provide the right products. Those who watch the market and listen to customers carefully will find opportunity.</p>



<p><strong>The font technology failure</strong><br>A designer once said, “Fonts are like air.” They are the environment in which DTP lives and thrives. Compared to the West, the Japanese DTP air is pretty thin.</p>



<p>One of the great tragedies was the refusal of <a href="https://atadistance.net/2020/04/25/requiem-for-shaken/" data-type="post" data-id="44199">Shaken KK</a>, the largest, most popular, and perhaps most beautiful Japanese font library, to license its faces to Adobe or have anything to do with PostScript. It kept its proprietary machines and formats, losing over 40 percent of its market share (and lots of prestige and talent) in the bargain. The industry is filled with ex-Shaken people. A low point came a year and a half ago when tax raiders found several safes in the company basement filled with 10,000-yen bills; the president of Shaken, Yuko Ishii had stashed away the money in the early ’80s and was now reporting it as profit.</p>



<p>This sorry state of affairs had two huge repercussions. It denied a large part of the Japanese font legacy to designers working with DTP. (Imagine a world without Helvetica and Times and you get the idea.) It also left the only other competitor, Morisawa, which did license its library to Adobe, with a practical monopoly. But these were not the only problems.</p>



<p><strong>Initial problems</strong><br>The first implementation of Japanese PostScript Type 1 fonts had serious shortcomings. First of all, they could not be downloaded on a per-job basis, but had to reside permanently on the printer. This turned the production process upside down; service bureaus and printers were suddenly dictating to designers which fonts could and could not be used. For every PostScript device, users had to invest in font licenses― and Japanese fonts are very expensive. In a market where making a single face can easily require ¥30,000,000 (about $280,000) and consume two years, font vendors made sure they got maximum return on their investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, Morisawa and Adobe came up with the idea of marketing two flavors of PostScript printer fonts: low-resolution (up to 600 dpi) and unlimited. A single unlimited-resolution Japanese font costs ¥218,000 (about $2,000).</p>



<p>The situation became more complex when ATM J arrived on the scene in late 1993. Morisawa’s ATM fonts used hardware binding to lock the font to the hard disk. This resulted in a high maintenance operation, because hardware binding required installer floppies for each font and for every CPU. (This remains true even today.) If the user got a new hard disk, he had to send the old floppies back to the vendor and exchange them, for a fee, for new ones. Large operations had the extra burden of keeping track of the floppy that had been installed on each CPU. On top of all this, each installation took time; putting a family of 15 Kanji fonts on two or three Macs could easily eat up a day.</p>



<p>In addition, compared to traditional systems, these fonts had primitive typographic features: lack of pair kerning, lack of proper metrics and poor Gaiji support. (Gaiji are Kanji characters outside of the current JIS [Japanese Industrial Standard] and Unicode encoding sets and are not included in a standard font. They comprise many “unofficial” Kanji characters, mistakes and misinterpretations, and seldom used Kanji passed down for generations, long before printing presses and governments created standards.</p>



<p>These Gaiji characters are widely used in people and place names. To this day, they are a reason for publishers to hang on to their proprietary systems. Last but not least, Japanese PostScript fonts were not cross platform.</p>



<p><strong>The first fix</strong><br>Adobe has been trying to fix the font problem. Its first attempt was CID (character-key ID). CID divorced two-byte PostScript fonts from dependence on any encoding scheme and allowed character subsets to be downloaded to the printer on a job basis, laying the foundation for PDF font embedding in Japanese Acrobat 4.0 as well.</p>



<p>Unfortunately the CID font upgrade was a marketing washout. Upgrades were not cheap, and there were few benefits the end user could really see. Morisawa also decided to tweak some glyph designs and the font metrics. Designers would open old files with the new fonts and find they had to redo everything. They stayed away in droves. As a result, the installed base is still overwhelmingly OCF (original composite font), which has slowed acceptance of PDF as a major production format.</p>



<p><strong>Dueling fixes</strong><br>Adobe’s final solution for the Japanese font problem is OpenType. OpenType will be a very big deal and, in the long term, fundamentally change the market. OpenType finally brings true font parity between Windows and Mac. Morisawa and Fontworks are busy preparing OpenType upgrades. It marks the first time their font libraries will be available cross-platform. Both companies see Windows as an opportunity for revenue growth―something that has been missing on the Mac side for years. Users will finally be able to choose the platform that best fits their needs and budgets without worrying about font problems.</p>



<p>This will be especially interesting because Mac OS X and OpenType are both arriving in 2001. According to a Japanese Publishing Consortium survey in 1999, Apple has nearly 80 percent of the DTP installed base. However, a large share of the machines in the printing and publishing areas (but not in design) are pre-G3 PowerPC systems that will have to be upgraded to run Mac OS X. Apple Japan’s “We’ll let the market decide” marketing statements may become a true nightmare if the market chooses Windows instead of Mac OS X</p>



<p><strong>Adobe Japan 1-4</strong><br>The most important feature of Japanese OpenType will be the Adobe Japan 1-4 character collection. This is the big Gaiji fix everybody has been waiting for. AJ 1-4 addresses the Gaiji encoding problem and provides a consistent and cross-platform way for font developers to add Gaiji to OpenType fonts. Adobe says the collection …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>While working on <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault’s</a> <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">Go Playground</a>, I came across a very strange error. The standard library’s <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/?m=all#Printf" rel="noopener">fmt.Printf()</a> function prints nothing to the console when called. <em>Nothing.</em></p>



<p>For those of you who are familiar with the function, when compiled to a “normal” executable <code>fmt.Printf</code> prints a formatted string to standard output. As per the official documentation, this program:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Will print:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p>The interesting thing is that when the same exact program is compiled using Web Assembly, we get a different result. If you want to try it, copy the above program and run it <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">here</a>.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: <em>It doesn’t print anything.</em></p>



<p>However, if you change the program slightly:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	// add a newline character
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Then it may print the expected:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p> thought if you run the two programs back to back, you may actually find that this is printed instead:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>When compiled to Web Assembly, the <code>fmt.Printf</code> function is writing to a buffer, and that buffer is not cleared until a newline character is printed to standard out. In other words, you can call <code>fmt.Printf</code> as many times as you want, but nothing is printed until a <code>\n</code> character comes through standard output.</p>



<p>Take a look at the <code>writeSync()</code> code in Go’s <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/classroom.qvault.io/blob/master/public/wasm_exec.js#L43">wasm_exec.js</a>, which is a required include to execute Go Web Assembly in the browser:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">writeSync(fd, buf) {
	outputBuf += decoder.decode(buf);
	const nl = outputBuf.lastIndexOf("\n");
	if (nl != -1) {
		console.log(outputBuf.substr(0, nl));
		outputBuf = outputBuf.substr(nl + 1);
	}
	return buf.length;
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, <code>console.log()</code> is only called on the buffer if a newline is found within the output string, otherwise the output is just appended to the stateful <code>outputBuf</code>.</p>



<p>My current working theory is that it was implemented this way because there is no way to print to the console in a browser without appending a newline. JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log" rel="noopener">console.log()</a> <em>always </em>appends a newline.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>This time the post is inspired by the proposal of <a href="https://github.com/Arkoniak">Andrey Oskin</a>
(thank you for submitting it, below I have adapted business problem description
and <code>dplyr</code> source codes that Andrey provided).</p>

<p>Andrey shared with me typical tasks that he is faced with when doing logs
analysis. To make things concrete, assume that you have a site and you collect
users’ clicks. In the output of this process you get a table with two fields:
time of click (<code>ts</code> column below, measured in seconds) and the user identifier
(<code>user_id</code> column below).</p>

<p>Given such data there are natural business questions, that we can ask, like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How many sessions an average user has?</li>
  <li>How many users have exactly two sessions?</li>
  <li>Find top 10 users, ordered by the descending number of sessions?</li>
  <li>What is the average time between sessions start?</li>
</ol>

<p>Session in these questions is a more or less arbitrary thing, usually,
it has a meaning of sequence of events that come together as there is
a short time difference between consecutive events. In the examples we
assume that if a user has not clicked on our site for 900 seconds after the last
click the session is over.</p>

<p>What I do in this post is take a toy data set that has this structure and
<code>dplyr</code> codes that Andrey shared with me that answer the business questions
presented above and rewrite them to DataFrames.jl.</p>

<p>The objective of this post is to compare the syntaxes of <code>dplyr</code> and
DataFrames.jl. Therefore neither <code>dplyr</code> nor DataFrames.jl codes were tuned
to be optimal. Rather I have just taken what Andrey proposed in <code>dplyr</code> and
translated it to DataFrames.jl in a way that first came to my mind (but trying
to use piping). However, in the last part of the post I out of curiosity I
decided compare the performance of the codes.</p>

<p>All codes were  tested under R version 4.0.2 and dplyr 1.0.0.
For Julia I used version 1.5.0-rc1.0 and packages: DataFrames.jl 0.21.4,
Pipe.jl 1.3.0, and ShiftedArrays 1.0.0. If you do not have much experience
with setting-up Julia project environments, in <a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/06/28/automatic-project-environments.html">this post</a> I give
a simple recipe how you can do it easily while ensuring you use exactly the same
versions of the packages as I do.</p>



<p>In the first step we load the required packages, create a data frame that
will be used later and sort it by the <code>ts</code> column.</p>

<p>In all examples in this post I first present R code, and then Julia code.
The expected output is shown in a comment. After each step I briefly comment
on the Julia code.</p>

<p>In this step I used two things that are worth learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>@pipe</code> macro from the Pipes.jl package allows to pass result of the left
hand side of <code>|&gt;</code> to the right hand side in the position where <code>_</code> is placed.
In this case <code>_</code> is a first argument to <code>sort</code>.</li>
  <li>I used <code>DataFrame!</code> constructor; the <code>!</code> in this case means that columns
passed to a freshly constructed data frame <em>are not copied</em> (by default
<code>DataFrame</code> constructor copies passed columns for safety).</li>
</ul>



<p>So the first task is to identify sessions in our data. For each user
a <code>session_id</code> column gives a number of session for this user, starting from
zero. Remember, that we assume that a fresh session starts for some user, if
two consecutive events for this user are separated by at least 900 seconds.</p>

<p><em>dplyr</em></p>

<p>Now I could have rewritten the <code>dpyr</code> code to DataFrames.jl in many ways, but
a most natural thing to do it was for me to use the following syntax:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>combine(source_column =&gt; transformation_function, grouped_data_frame)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>With this approach I can conveniently define an anonymous function
within a <code>begin</code>-<code>end</code> block and return a <code>(ts=ts, session_id=session_id)</code> value
that is a <code>NamedTuple</code> and will get expanded into two columns of a data frame.</p>

<p>I use <code>ungroup=false</code> syntax to keep the result a <code>GroupedDataFrame</code> to match
what we get in <code>dplyr</code>.</p>

<p>Also, in the code of the function I use the <code>lag</code> function from ShiftedArrays.jl.</p>

<p>Now we have all information to answer our business questions.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{m-1,0}B &amp; A_{m-1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} 
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    (A_{0,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,0}B)^{\dagger} \\
    (A_{0,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,1}B)^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    (A_{0,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \overline{A_{0,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{0,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    A_{1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{n-1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{n-1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1,m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=
A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\]

</p><p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) &amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)^{\dagger} (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | x \rangle^{\dagger}) (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger}|\phi\rangle) \otimes (| x \rangle^{\dagger}|x\rangle) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle x | x \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes 1\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= \langle x, y \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Using the definition of inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= (Uy)^{\dagger} (Ux) \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}U^{\dagger} U x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}(U^{\dagger} U) x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} I x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;= \langle x, y \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the “vacant” system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that “copying” any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such “copy” operator, the mathematical expression for “copy” will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum “copy” operator that makes “copy” of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

<p>For more than two millennia, Western thinkers have separated emotion from cognition – emotion being the poorer sibling of the two. Cognition helps to explain the nature of space-time and sends humans to the Moon. Emotion might save the lioness in the savannah, but it also makes humans act irrationally with disconcerting frequency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the quest to create intelligent robots, designers tend to focus on purely rational, cognitive capacities. It’s tempting to disregard emotion entirely, or include only as much as necessary. But without emotion to help determine the personal significance of objects and actions, I doubt that true intelligence can exist – not the kind that beats human opponents at chess or the game of Go, but the sort of smarts that we humans recognise as such. Although we can refer to certain behaviours as either ‘emotional’ or ‘cognitive’, this is really a linguistic short-cut. The two can’t be teased apart.</p>



<p>What counts as sophisticated, intelligent behaviour in the first place? Consider a crew of robots on a mission to Mars. To act intelligently, the robots can’t just scuttle about taking pictures of the environment and collecting dirt and mineral samples. They’d need to be able to figure out how to reach a target destination, and come up with alternative tactics if the most direct path is blocked. If pressed for time, the team of robots would have to know which materials are more important and to be prioritised as part of the expedition.</p>



<p>Part of being intelligent, then, is about the ability to function autonomously in various conditions and environments. Emotion is helpful here because it allows an agent to piece together the most significant kinds of information. For example, emotion can <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sociable-robots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instil</a> a sense of urgency in actions and decisions. Imagine crossing a patch of desert in an unreliable car, during the hottest hours of the day. If the vehicle breaks down, what you need is a quick fix to get you to the next town, not a more permanent solution that might be perfect but could take many hours to complete in the beating sun. In real-world scenarios, a ‘good’ outcome is often all that’s required, but without the external pressure of perceiving a ‘stressful’ situation, an android might take too long trying to find the optimal solution.</p>



<p>Most <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195166194.001.0001/acprof-9780195166194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposals</a> for emotion in robots involve the addition of a separate ‘emotion module’ – some sort of bolted-on affective architecture that can influence other abilities such as perception and cognition. The idea would be to give the agent access to an enriched set of properties, such as the urgency of an action or the meaning of facial expressions. These properties could help to determine issues such as which visual objects should be processed first, what memories should be recollected, and which decisions will lead to better outcomes.</p>



<p>But research from the behavioural and brain sciences suggests that emotion is not just an ‘added feature’ layered on top of ‘standard’ cognition. Instead, it’s an integral part of our cognitive machinery. In one of the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0904551106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experiments</a> from my lab, people in a scanner watched videos of rapid, flashed-up images of either a house or a skyscraper. They had to identify which of these scenes was present in the video, a task designed to be very difficult. We then introduced an element of emotional manipulation. Before viewing the clips, half of the participants received a mild electric shock while viewing a series of skyscrapers; the other half, instead, watched a series of houses appear, paired with the same mild shock. This is what’s known as <em>classical conditioning</em>, and links an initially neutral stimulus (a nondescript picture) with the emotional meaning of the unpleasant stimulus (the shock).</p>



<p>The outcome: participants conditioned to the skyscrapers were better at detecting them than at detecting houses; conversely, participants conditioned to houses detected those better than they did skyscrapers. And in each case, responses in the visual cortex were stronger for the type of stimulus (house or skyscraper) to which participants had been conditioned. This study shows that perception is not a passive process that merely reflects the external world. Rather, it involves picking up on the significance of objects, and determines how they are processed. Vision is never neutral, it is always laden with affective meaning.</p>



<p>It’s the architecture of the brain, with its short- and long-range connections, that allows these properties to emerge. Emotion doesn’t come about from local computations in a single region, such as the amygdala, which is frequently called the ‘emotion centre’ in the brain. Instead, anatomical <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1238406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> have revealed that the areas in the brain associated with perception, cognition, emotion, motivation, action and bodily sensations are closely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2017.03.002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intertwined</a>. Looking at the brain as a complex network helps to clarify why some brain structures, such as the amygdala, are important for emotion: they’re hubs, much like major airports that link to a very large number of destinations. As a consequence, these regions can influence and be influenced by many parts of the brain – which also suggests that it’s not possible to subtract emotion without affecting cognition.</p>



<p>The point is <em>not</em> that emotion is needed for intelligent, autonomous robots – the answer is yes – but that emotion needs to be hooked up to everything that goes on in a cognitive system. Emotion is not an ‘add-on’ module that endows a robot with feelings or allows it to express an internal state, such as the current risk of overheating. Its integration is a design principle of the information-processing architecture. Without emotion, no being that we might create can have any hope of aspiring to true intelligence.</p>

<p>Work hard, become successful, <em>then</em> you’ll be happy. At least, that’s what many of us were taught by our parents, teachers and peers. The idea that we must pursue success in order to experience happiness is enshrined in the United States’ most treasured institutions (the Declaration of Independence), beliefs (the American dream), and stories (<em>Rocky</em> and Cinderella). Most people <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11392863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">want</a> to be happy, so we chase success like a proverbial carrot on a stick – thinking that contentment lurks just the other side of getting into college, landing a dream job, being promoted or making six figures. But for many chasers, both success and happiness remain perpetually out of reach. The problem is that the equation might be backwards. </p>



<p>Our <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069072707308140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothesis</a> is that happiness precedes and leads to career success – not the other way around. In psychological <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232577536_Subjective_Well-Being_Three_Decades_of_Progress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">science</a>, ‘happiness’ relates to ‘subjective wellbeing’ and ‘positive emotions’ (we use the terms interchangeably). Those with greater wellbeing tend to be more satisfied with their lives, and also to experience more positive emotions and fewer negative ones. Research <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069072717751441?journalCode=jcaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggests</a> that it’s these positive emotions – such as excitement, joy, and serenity – that promote success in the workplace.</p>



<p>Let’s look first at the cross-sectional studies that examine people at a single point. This allows researchers to determine whether happiness and success are correlated. Relative to their glummer peers, happier people are more satisfied with their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/096317909X478557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs</a>; they also receive greater <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879196915560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social support</a> from co-workers and better <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199901)20:1%3C1::AID-JOB885%3E3.0.CO;2-W" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance evaluations</a> from supervisors. Notably, it might be that bosses give happy employees higher performance evaluations due to a halo effect, where a favourable impression in one area (such as happiness) influences opinion in another area (such as work ability): eg, ‘Tim is happy, so he must be great at his job too.’ However, there’s also some evidence that people with higher wellbeing perform better on a range of work-related tasks: one pivotal <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232497771_Explanatory_Style_as_a_Predictor_of_Productivity_and_Quitting_Among_Life_Insurance_Sales_Agents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that sales agents with a more positive outlook sold 37 per cent more life-insurance policies than their less positive colleagues.</p>



<p>Happiness is associated with excellent work performance in <a href="http://www.shawnachor.com/the-books/the-happiness-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other areas</a> as well. People who frequently experience positive emotions <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.01017.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tend to</a> go above and beyond for their organisations; they’re also less likely to be <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10717919070130020401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absent</a> from work or <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-03046-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quit</a> their jobs. People with better wellbeing also tend to earn bigger <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1014411319119.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">salaries</a> than those with lower wellbeing.</p>



<p>However, such cross-sectional research has its limits, since it can’t establish which comes first – happiness or success. Longitudinal studies can help here, as they follow people over days, weeks, months or years to see how they’ve changed over time. According to the longitudinal literature, people who start out happy eventually become successful, too. The more content a person is at an earlier point in time, the more likely she is to be clear later on about what <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879105001016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kind of job</a> she wants, as well as to fill out more <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job applications</a>, and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167212444906?casa_token=vPK_H2R02nQAAAAA:K-Q5uKmbRhlEekZ_6XOcUQ522go9OJ79pRU-bZ6umWZGfzJ34ThuC7lW5HwJ0hP8Ky9y65R_V05O-bo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find</a> employment. A key <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1005539609679.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that young people who reported higher wellbeing than their peers just before graduating from college were more likely to receive follow-up job interviews three months later.</p>



<p>Positive emotions are also predictors of later achievement and earnings. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12635918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, happy 18-year-olds were more likely to be working in prestigious, satisfying jobs and to feel financially secure by age 26. In <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1019672513984.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>, people who were more cheerful when starting college went on to have higher incomes.</p>



<p>But it’s not enough to establish that happiness comes <em>before</em> success; we want to know, does one <em>cause</em> the other? After all, there could be some unmeasured variable, such as intelligence or extraversion, that’s driving both wellbeing and work performance. Indeed, extraverts are more likely both to be <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7449572_Personality_and_the_Prediction_of_Consequential_Outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happy</a> and to earn <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9914.2010.00477.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greater incomes</a>.</p>



<p>Well-designed experiments can control for these variables. For example, studies have randomly assigned people to situations that make them feel neutral, negative or positive emotional states, and then measured their subsequent performance on work-related tasks. These <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experiments</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1986-29171-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed</a> that people who are made to feel positive emotions set more ambitious goals, persist at challenging tasks for longer, view themselves and others more favourably, and believe they will succeed. Happy people’s optimistic expectations appear to be realistic, too: on both <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1990.tb00417.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clerical-coding</a> assignments and <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992168.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digit-substitution</a> tasks, people with positive emotions <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1526075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tend</a> to do better and be more productive than those in the grip of neutral or negative emotions. The weight of experimental evidence suggests that happier people outperform less happy people, and that their positive demeanour is probably the cause.</p>



<p>From our review of more than 170 cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies, it’s clear that wellbeing promotes career success in many ways. That’s not to say that unhappy people can’t succeed – which is just as well, as a sad person reading this and telling herself she <em>must</em> cheer up to be successful is unlikely to help matters! To the contrary, history demonstrates that depressed individuals such as Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill can accomplish incredible feats. Both negative and positive emotions are adaptive to situations – there’s a time to be sad, just like there’s a time to be happy.</p>



<p>So for any business leaders or managers reading this, we’d caution against hiring only overtly happy people or pressuring your employees to be more upbeat. Such strategies have backfired in the past – as in the case of the mandatory jollity imposed on staff at the US supermarket chain Trader Joe’s, where the policy ironically made workers more miserable. People and companies hoping to boost happiness in a healthier way would have better luck if they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> positive activities, like performing acts of kindness and expressing gratitude.</p>



<p>The philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1951 said that: ‘The good life, as I conceive it, is a happy life.’ But he went on: ‘I do not mean that if you are good you will be happy; I mean that if you are happy you will be good.’ When it comes to making your mark at work, we agree. If you want to be successful, don’t hang around and wait to find happiness: <em>start</em> there instead.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_13429"><div><p>We’ve all sat in those presentations.  A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along.  We’re so used to it we expect it.  We accept it.  We even consider it ‘learning’. As an educator I push against ‘death by PowerPoint’ and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach.  The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills.  Most often the only victims are our audience’s inspiration and interest.  This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.</p><p>January 16th 2003.  NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit.  Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them.  Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one.  Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.  </p><p>The launch proceeded as normal.  The crew settled into their mission.  They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments.  One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.  </p><p>As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank.  At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank.  As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle’s left wing.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_17738"><div><p>It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing.   Foam falling during launch was nothing new.  It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place.  But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth’s atmosphere during launch and re-entry.  In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn’t know how it would respond to re-entry.  There were a number of options.  The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull.  NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up.  Or they could risk re-entry.  </p><p>NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides.    The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia.  This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_26426"><div><p>NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint.  The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks.  NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.  They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as normal.  Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003.  Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle’s left wing were abnormally high and then were lost.  Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew.  At 0912, as Columbia should have been approaching the runway, ground control heard reports from residents near Dallas that the shuttle had been seen disintegrating.  Columbia was lost and with it her crew of seven.  The oldest crew member was 48.  </p><p>The shuttle programme was on lock down, grounded for two years as the investigation began.  The cause of the accident became clear: <em>a hole in a tile on the left wing caused by the foam let the wing dangerously overheat until the shuttle disintegrated</em>.  </p><p>The questions to answer included a very simple one: <strong>Why, given that the foam strike had occurred at a force massively out of test conditions had NASA proceeded with re-entry? </strong> </p><p>Edward Tufte, a Professor at Yale University and expert in communication reviewed the slideshow the Boeing engineers had given NASA, in particular the above slide.  His findings were tragically profound.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_26463"><p>Thirdly, there is a huge amount of text, more than 100 words or figures on one screen.   Two words, ‘SOFI’ and ‘ramp’ both mean the same thing: the foam.  Vague terms are used.  <em>Sufficient</em> is used once, <em>significant </em>or <em>significantly</em>, five times with little or no quantifiable data.  As a result this left a lot open to audience interpretation.  How much is significant?  Is it statistical significance you mean or something else?  </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_55842"><div><p>NASA’s subsequent report criticised technical aspects along with human factors.  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_full.pdf" target="_blank">Their report</a> mentioned an over-reliance on PowerPoint:</p><p><em> “The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA.” </em></p><p> Edward Tufte’s full report makes for<a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB" target="_blank"> fascinating reading</a>. Since being released in 1987 PowerPoint has grown exponentially to the point where <a href="https://www.thinkoutsidetheslide.com/are-we-wasting-250-million-per-day-due-to-bad-powerpoint/" target="_blank">it is now estimated</a> than thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day.  Yet, PowerPoint is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/powerpoint-thought-students-bullet-points-information" target="_blank">blamed</a> by academics for killing critical thought.  Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/08/22/jeff-bezos-banned-powerpoint-presentations-at-amazon-meetings-heres-what-replaced-them/#4578b4773b5f" target="_blank">banned it from meetings</a>.   Typing text on a screen and reading it out loud does not count as teaching.  An audience reading text off the screen does not count as learning.  Imagine if the engineers had put up a slide with just: “<strong>foam strike more than 600 times bigger than test data</strong>.”  Maybe NASA would have listened.  Maybe they wouldn’t have attempted re-entry.  Next time you’re asked to give a talk remember Columbia. Don’t just jump to your laptop and write out slides of text.  Think about your message.  Don’t let that message be lost amongst text.  Death by PowerPoint is a real thing.  Sometimes literally.</p><p>Thanks for reading</p><p> - Jamie </p></div></div></div>]]>

Morrison shelters were a way of protecting people from in their own homes from falling bombs. This was an alternative to the Anderson shelter in the garden and the public shelters.</p><table><tbody>

<p>
The Morrison shelter’s official name is the “Table (<i>Morrison</i>) indoor shelter”, it was designed by John Baker and named after Herbert Morrison who was the Minister of Home Security at the time. The idea for the Morrison shelter was fed from the realization that there was a lack of indoor shelters as not enough homes had cellars.</p><p>

The Morrison shelter measured approximately 6 ft 6 inches (1.98m) long, 4 ft (1.21m) wide and 2 ft 6 inches (0.76m) high. With a steel plate “table” top, welded wire mesh sides, and a metal lath floor. Three tools were supplied with the pack that you built up inside your home and it had 359 parts altogether. A lot of people used the shelter as a table and had bedding inside of it.</p><table><tbody>

Derek Lambert <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0000CMLO7/">describes</a> how this new shelter at first appeared to be a more comfortable option:</p><blockquote>
When the first savagery of the night attacks faded we left the cupboard under the stairs and moved into a Morrison shelter.<p>

This was a large metal cage a little higher than a dinner table. It had a hefty iron frame with a sheet steel ceiling screwed together with chunky nuts and bolts. Underneath was a crude wire mattress. It was massive and angular and filled the dining room except for a space in front of the fire.</p><p>

It became part of the house, a foundation almost; we slept in it and on it, we ate from it, we played in it. When the siren sounded we were supposed to dive inside and put up steel mesh around the sides. Thus, according to the theorists, we were protected from falling masonry by the frame and steel ceiling and from flying rubble by the mesh cage.</p><p>

When the Germans resumed the destruction of such military targets as schools, shops, houses and sleeping cows we spent all night in the shelter...</p><p>

As the bombs stirred the ground and the shrapnel clattered down the road we fought a quiet battle of cunning for the bedclothes. Feet touched faces, arms swung across chests, elbows elbowed; snores bubbled and spluttered to be silenced by ostensibly accidental blows; fragments of wild dream-talk escaped from the depths of our private lives. Enmity was closer to the surface during those caged nights than at any other time in our well-mannered lives.</p><p>

The system collapsed after a few weeks. White-faced, shadow-eyed, we decided that for the sake of health and happiness two of us would have to evacuate the shelter. For the next few months my parents slept on top of it while I rolled and stretched and crawled and sometimes slept beneath. When the next lull in the bombing came we crept back to our beds.</p></blockquote><p>
Half a million Morrison shelters had been distributed by the end of 1941, with a further 100,000 being added in 1943 to prepare the population for the expected German V-1 flying bomb.
