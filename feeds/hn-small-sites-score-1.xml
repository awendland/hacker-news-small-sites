  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/fucked-up-everybody-knows">here</a>.</p>

<p>We all fuck up. All the time. It’s human and it’s ok. As long as we don’t let our ego blind us and learn from our mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="you-fucked-up">You fucked up</h3>

<p>Here is a message I wrote on a private Slack channel not so long ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@here Peeps just wanted to say something about the whole search feature. Using the provider directly or as a bypass is something that WE, as Engineering team decide. If we think it will help the current and possible future product requirements, then we can go with it. But if we think there is a simpler solution to meet the product requirements then we will go with that one. Just wanted to say that is US who decide how to implement the feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much is wrong with this message. It is pretty aggressive. It promotes division between Product Managers and Software Engineers. The use of <em>@here</em> doens’t help. And the use of capital letters doesn’t help either.</p>

<p>I know it is out of context but the important thing here is that <em>I just fucked up</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/alone_before_dawn.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="everybody-knows">Everybody knows</h3>

<p>When you reach a certain point in life, it is hard to make friends outside of the work environment. A big part of my social life and interests spins around the startup ecosystem.</p>

<p>I’m subscribed to newsletters, read books and blogs, read newspaper articles and listen to podcasts. I spend a lot of time on Twitter. I have silly T-shirts. I go to meetups and events. I have a blog. And I don’t have the data (I wish) but I assume most startup employees do the same.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve made very good friends around the startup ecosystem. We all have the same problems and we all have to overcome the same personal challenges. We are all interested in what happens in other startups, how do they overcome those problems, how did they evolve and where did they screw up so we don’t have to. The books are a nice way to learn the theory but nothing helps you as much as sharing experiences with other people.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/conversation.png" alt=""></p>

<p>My point is… we know. Everybody knows. We know when you fired someone while they were on medical sick leave. We know about that aggressive Slack message even if it was on a private channel. We know about your dubious marketing practices. We know about your homophobic comments during lunch time. We know about your unhealthy hiring process and how you never give any feedback to the candidates that don’t pass. We know about that time you left a meeting screaming and slamming doors. We know how unhealty is your culture and how bad is your internal communication.</p>

<p>It doens’t matter if you are a Software Engineer, a Product Manager, the CEO or an Engineering Manager. The consequences are demolishing. You won’t be able to hire the people you want. You won’t be hired by the companies you want. You won’t be able to work with the investors you seek. You won’t be invited to give a talk to a meetup. Nobody will read your blog. You won’t be able to grow. And the list goes on and on.</p>

<h3 id="and-now-what">And now what?</h3>

<p>You can’t hide. You can’t undo what you’ve done. And you can’t deny it. But you can fix it.</p>

<p>It’s sad that I have to be so explicit but, as Fitzpatrick and Collins-Sussman write in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/debugging-teams/9781491932049/">Debugging Teams</a>, you should build your culture around <em>humility</em>, <em>respect</em> and <em>trust</em> from the beginning. Not only your culture, but also yourself. Because almost every social conflict can ultimately be traced back to a lack of one of these 3.</p>

<p>You will fuck up. I do all the time. In many ways. And I’m ashamed of some of them. But we are all here in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g">pale blue dot</a> learning how not to be douchebags. We either learn to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QnujP4LDhI">live together, or die alone</a>. You see, <em>learning</em> is the key. If you have a true desire to <em>improve</em> as a human being and as a professional, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD3F7J2PeYU">it will be alright</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own journey but the basics are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd10-f9bzu0">accountability</a> and admit your ego was bigger than your <em>values</em> and <em>principles</em>. Admit you were wrong. Sometimes you need to ask for forgiveness. There is no other way you can wash your own image and the image of your startup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify your own personal issues and start working on them. Being a decent human being is hard. Talking with your manager, with your mentor or with your friend works sometimes. Therapy works most of the time. It works for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start acting like everything could go public at any time. It already is public. NDAs protect intellectual property but they don’t stop spreading the word about unhealthy culture and toxic personalities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start identifying and fixing the systemic problems of your unhealthy culture <a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1276618589441835008">one by one</a>. ASAP. Mostly because it takes a lot of time and effort. So the sooner you start, the sooner you’re going to see results. Your role doesn’t matter. Take ownership and start fixing your culture. Some books I recommend on this topic: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/debugging-teams/9781491932049/">Debugging Teams</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm">It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-collaboration/9781492041726/">Mastering Collaboration</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are/dp/0062871331/">What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture</a>.</p>

<p>…or sculpturing is not that bad for health ;P</p>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Well, it just had to be this pic:)</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h4>The story</h4>
<p>Some time ago, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion/Bonzai</a> asked me to fix his SX-64 keyboard. I was like … hell yeah! … I’ve never worked on SX-64 gear. The problem was, at that moment I didn’t know what was wrong with that keyboard … until pics arrived</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=29175">Yugorin</a> run an awesome website – <a href="https://c64portal.pl/">c64portal.pl</a> – The website is in Polish and contains lots of valuable info about Polish Commodore demoscene and Commodore in general. Both gentlemen are also the main guys behind the <a href="https://moonshinedragons.party/">Moonshine Dragons party – currently, the largest C64 party in Poland.</a></p>
<p>Since I already agreed that I’ll fix it, there was no excuse. Carrion sent me that keyboard and the party has begun 🙂</p>

<p>I had to remove the original stickers. That was done using a hotair gun set to 100 degrees C</p>

<h4>Plastic welding and reinforcements</h4>
<p>As it turned out, after close inspection, there were way more cracks than I thought.</p>
<p>All these cracks had to be addressed and reinforced – <a href="https://retrohax.net/extreme-refurbishing-episode-2-atari-800-xl-part-one/">this is a lesson that I’ve learned after my Atari 800 XL refurb</a> where joints were not stable enough and resulted in tiny cracks over time.</p>
<p>To achieve a proper result, I’ve welded in a brass mesh to serve as a reinforcement of cracked spots and as a base for resin-based compounds used later to rebuild missing plastic. Obviously, the mesh had to be custom cut.</p>
<p>This is how the process looks.</p>

<p>Once every piece was cut to a proper size, I’ve soldered them together. I’ve also added a thicker copper wire to make the mesh stiffer and less prone to bending.</p>

<h4>Rebuilding missing plastic</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was ready to apply fiber-glass putty. This is a quite messy process and looks kinda ugly. I’ve used some old PCB laminate to get every edge correctly positioned and as close to the original as possible. This part boils down to pretty much three things – putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … etc. etc.</p>

<p>After making slots, I could start trying on the bottom part against the top. Unfortunately, one of the hooks snapped off during the process 🙁</p>
<p>I had to fix it first. I’ve made it out of a metal paper clip that was cut down to size and welded in a top case.</p>

<h4>Epoxy resin and finishing</h4>
<p>After all the above work was done, I’ve mixed a cup of thin epoxy resin to fill in hard to access gaps and spots. It also helped to smoothen all uneven surfaces. The resin was applied to all spots with brass mesh with a plastic pipette.</p>

<p>Once the resin cured, I’ve applied a layer of spray putty which helped me to spot all minor mistakes and correct them with finishing putty and 400 grit sandpaper.</p>

<p>After another round of putty and sanding, I’ve applied black undercoating which was then wet-sanded with 1000 grit this time.</p>

<p>Finally, I could apply the last two layers of custom made spray paint. This paint color exactly matches the original. These custom spray paints for various computers will be available in my <a href="https://retrohax.net/">webshop</a> soon. The first series of spray paints will include the following colors:</p>
<ul><li> Atari XL Beige</li><li> Atari XE/ST Gray</li><li> Commodore 64C Beige</li><li> Amiga 500 Beige </li></ul>

<h4>Badges and plastics</h4>
<p>Due to its age, paint from a badge chipped off during removal so I had to fix it. I’ve used a standard black marker to cover all these tiny spots. Later, I’ve removed old glue from the rubber base and applied fresh double-sided adhesive tape on both rubber and badge.</p>

<p>I also had to address other scratched plastic parts. That was easily fixed by applying a thin layer of silicone oil.</p>

<h4>Keyboard cleaning</h4>
<p>Obviously, all keycaps had to be clean. This time, I had to remove every single keycap and clean it individually. It took a while to get it done properly 🙂</p>

<p>Don’t ask me why so late but this is the moment when I’ve realized there is a major failure :/</p>
<p>I’ve no idea why I didn’t spot it earlier. After assembly, it turned out that there is a small gap between parts. It is barely visible and only from a side of the case but I was pissed off at myself that I didn’t spot it and fix it before the case was painted.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/k6m1xzj.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/k6m1xzj.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Obviously, I didn’t have any spray paint left.</p>
<h4>The grand finale</h4>
<p>This restoration was rather time-consuming. It took more or less 15 workdays. This is because I had to wait for chemistry to fully cure before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p>So here it is. Fully restored Commodore SX-64 keyboard for Carrion. Hopefully, he will like it 🙂</p>

<h4 id="a-primer-on-the-cruel-tacit-laws-of-type-level-programming-in-haskell"><em>A primer on the cruel, tacit laws of type-level programming in Haskell</em></h4>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/81239044-afe24580-8fd1-11ea-96b0-274cf839e834.png" alt="the haskell type system: a machine of constant, unforgiving judgement and rigid classification"></p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>
      <th>Kind</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Int</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>

      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>

      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[Int]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(,)</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either Void Void</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

    <span>uint32_t</span> nbuckets;
    <span>uint32_t</span> symoffset;

    <span>uint64_t</span> bloom[bloom_size]; 
    <span>uint32_t</span> buckets[nbuckets];
    <span>uint32_t</span> chain[];
};
</pre><h2>Bloom filter</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a> is used to stop the lookup for missing symbols early. <code>bloom_size</code>, <code>bloom_shift</code>, and <code>bloom</code> are parts of the structure, as their names suggest.</p><p>Bloom filter behaves slightly differently for various <code>ELFCLASS</code> binaries (defined by <code>EI_CLASS</code> field in <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi4+/ch4.eheader.html#elfid">ELF Identification</a>). Let's define <code>ELFCLASS_BITS</code> to be <code>64</code> for 64-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS64</code>) and <code>32</code> for 32-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS32</code>).</p><p>Before doing symbol lookup, take <code>bloom[(hash / ELFCLASS_BITS) % bloom_size]</code>. If bits <code>hash % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> and <code>(hash &gt;&gt; bloom_shift) % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> are set then a symbol <strong>may or may not</strong> be in the hash table, and you should proceed with a regular lookup through buckets and chains. But if at least one bit is not set then a symbol is <strong>certainly</strong> absent from the hash table.</p><h2>Buckets and chains</h2><p><code>DT_HASH</code> contains an element per symbol table's element. This leads to a waste of space because <code>STN_UNDEF</code> and some other symbols are in the hash table but are never looked up. GNU hash table allows to skip first <code>symoffset</code> symbols at the beginning of the symbol table.</p><p>Same as in <code>DT_HASH</code>, symbols are put in one of <code>nbuckets</code> buckets depending on their hashes. To be specific, each symbol should be placed into <code>hash % nbuckets</code> bucket.</p><p>Chains in the GNU hash table are nothing like strange linked lists in <code>DT_HASH</code>, they are contiguous sequences of hashes for symbols with the same index (remember that chains' indexes are shifted by <code>symoffset</code> relatively to the symbol table). The last bit in chains' element is discarded and instead used for indicating the chain's end. If it is set then the element is the last one in the chain.</p><p><code>bucket</code> array holds indexes of the first symbols in the chains. Note that those are not indexes for the <code>chain</code> array. Indexes for it will be <code>bucket[foobar] - symoffset</code>.</p><p>Chains being contiguous sequences imply that symbols within the same bucket must be stored contiguously. Order of buckets in the symbol table does not really matter but usually they're stored in an ascending order.</p><p>While looking extraneous, creating such restriction over the symbol table gives great advantage: a hash table now can store almost full hash (without the lowest bit) of a symbol within the same 32 bits. This allows linkers to compare hashes before comparing strings. Also, because <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> requires symbol table ordering and <code>DT_HASH</code> doesn't, you can fit both into a single binary. This way both standard and GNU linkers can look up symbols in it.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Nothing is better than a visual representation of the rules. So, let's create one.</p><p>I took the same symbols as in <a href="https://flapenguin.me/2017/04/24/elf-lookup-dt-hash">ELF: symbol lookup via DT_HASH</a> and created <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> table from them. The example is for 64-bit ELF binaries, for 32-bit you'll need to recalculate bloom word and bits.</p><pre>nbuckets = 4      (because I decided that there will be four buckets)
symoffset = 1    (STN_UNDEF is not a part of the hash table)
bloom_size = 2   (because I decided that 16 byte bloom filter is sufficient)
bloom_shift = 5  (again, just because I can)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post" itemprop="articleBody">

    

<p>In this benchmark test, we compare three web application servers—Go, Node, and Elixir (<a href="https://ninenines.eu/">Cowboy</a>)—by subjecting each to a synthetic workload, first with 10k, and later with 100k connections.</p>

<p>To simulate a generic web application client and server behavior, we have devised the following synthetic workload. The client device opens a connection and sends 100 requests with 900±5% milliseconds in between each one. The server handles a request by sleeping for 100±5% milliseconds, to simulate a backend database request, and then returns 1 kB of payload. Without additional delays, this results in average connection lifetime of 100 seconds, and average load of 1 request per second, per device.</p>

<p>In the first test, we set the target to simulate 10k devices on a c5.2xlrage AWS instance that has 8 vCPUs and 16 GiB of RAM.</p>

<p>In the second test, we set the target to simulate 100k devices on a c5.9xlarge AWS instance that has 36 vCPUs and 72 GiB of RAM.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, our target load was 10k and 100k requests per second. The test run consisted of a 20-minute rampup from 0 to the target device count and load, then 20 minutes of sustained target device count and load, and, finally, a 20-minute rampdown back to 0. Each test takes 1 hour to complete.</p>

<p>The metrics were collected from two sources. First, we collected the following metrics from each client device: the time to open a connection, the time from sending a request to receiving HTTP headers of the corresponding response, and the time from receiving HTTP headers to receiving the entire HTTP body.</p>

<p>These metrics were aggregated from all client devices into histograms to retain distribution characteristics. In addition, summary metrics such as the total number of open connections and average requests per second were collected.</p>

<p>The second source of metrics was the target server itself, where we collected network and CPU utilization.</p>

<p>We used Ubuntu 18.04 with 4.15.0-1031-aws kernel, with sysctld overrides seen in our <a href="https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/blob/dbcc59ce83234bb55d6766ea914f116761bfe9e7/etc/sysctl.d/10-dummy.conf">/etc/sysctl.d/10-dummy.conf</a>.</p>

<p>Our test webservers were Go version 1.10.4, Node version 10.14.2, and Erlang 21.2.4-1 with Cowboy 2.6 and Ranch 1.7. The source code for each test application is available at <a href="https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/tree/dbcc59ce83234bb55d6766ea914f116761bfe9e7">https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-10k-connections-test">The 10k Connections Test</h2>

<p>In the 10k test, all test webservers achieved their target connection count.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-active.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-active.png"></a></p>

<p>Go and Elixir both were mostly keeping up with the target load of 10k requests per second. Node, due to latencies we will see later, was maxing out at slightly below 10k requests per second.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-rps.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-rps.png"></a></p>

<p>The time to open a connection averaged out in single-digit milliseconds. It is mostly the same across the three subjects, with the exception of Go having a few hiccups during the rampup phase.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-conn.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-conn.png"></a></p>

<p>The time to receive request headers includes our artificial delay of 100 milliseconds and randomization of ±5%. Both Go and Elixir are very similar in reflecting this delay, in addition to constant network latency. The story with Node is very different, as we observe it adding latency immediately, followed by a big jump in both latency and latency deviation about 12 minutes into the run, when the rampup hits 5750 requests per second.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-headers.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-headers.png"></a></p>

<p>The time to receive request body averaged out in single-digit microseconds. In the sustained phase, Go, Node, and Elixir are very similar.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-body.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-body.png"></a></p>

<p>Inbound network utilization is very similar for all three test applications. In the sustained phase, it is 1.75 MB per second, which makes one request be around 175 bytes. Outbound network utilization is closely correlated to requests per second, with Node somewhat lagging behind. In the sustained phase, it is around 12.5 MB per second, which means for every 1kB of payload there is about 250 bytes of protocol overhead.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-network.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-network.png"></a></p>

<p>CPU utilization is where things get interesting. The Node application utilized the least amount of CPU time and achieved its maximum CPU utilization while still in the rampup phase. We’ve seen that Go and Elixir demonstrated very similar performance characteristics from a client’s perspective, yet Elixir achieved this result with <em>significantly</em> higher CPU utilization.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-cpu.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-cpu.png"></a></p>

<h2 id="the-100k-connections-test">The 100k Connections Test</h2>

<p>In the 100k test, only Go and Elixir reached the target connection count. Node peaked at about 60k connections.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-active.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-active.png"></a></p>

<p>Both Go and Elixir were also able to keep the sustained target load of 100k requests per second. Node maxed out at about 25k requests per second.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-rps.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-rps.png"></a></p>

<p>12 seconds into the rampup phase, at about 60k connections, Node became severely overloaded with connections taking single-digit seconds to open.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn.png"></a></p>

<p>Go and Elixir remained in low single-digit milliseconds to open connection, with a few hiccups.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn2.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn2.png"></a></p>

<p>As Node overloaded, the average time to receive request headers grew to 1.5 seconds.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-headers.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-headers.png"></a></p>

<p>For both Go and Elixir, the time to receive request headers remained at around 100 milliseconds. Notably, Elixir maintained a nearly-constant performance throughout the entire test. Go’s average slowed by a few milliseconds after reaching about 70k connections.</p>

<p>The time to receive request body remained in single-digit microseconds, with a distribution very similar to the 10k test. This likely means we are testing the client side :-)</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-body.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-body.png"></a></p>

<p>Network utilization grew proportionally to the 10k test. Go and Elixir both peaked at 125 MB/s on the outbound network, which is about 1 Gigabit per second. This means that if we wanted to achieve 10x of the workload, we would come close to saturating a 10 Gb/s link. Node, by peaking at below the target workload, also showed network utilization corresponding to the handled load.</p>

<p>CPU utilization confirms the findings from the 10k test. Go was very efficient in using CPU and would have headroom, had the application been more compute-intensive. Elixir nearly saturated all 36 cores while delivering a surprisingly consistent performance. Node exhausted its scalability limit while utilizing only single-digit percent of available CPU resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-cpu.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-cpu.png"></a></p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>To run this test, we used the <a href="https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/stressgrid">Stressgrid</a> framework with 2 c5.2xlrage generators for 10k devices and 20 c5.2xlrage generators for 100k devices. Stressgrid monitors CPU utilization of the generators, so we can avoid skewed results due to generator oversaturation. In this test, all generators stayed below 80% CPU utilization.</p>

<p>Both target and generator instances were placed into a single VPC with two availability zones, using the internal IP network for communication. With this approach, we tried to simulate the typical behavior of a load balancer. With on-demand instances, the 10k test cost was around $10 and the 100k test cost was around $40, including data transfer.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The goal of this benchmark was <em>not</em> to analyze why Go, Node, and Elixir exhibit the observed behavior. Instead, we wanted to quantify their behavior so that readers familiar with the internal workings of each system can reflect on the strong and the weak sides. For those readers already using one of the systems, or those planning to migrate from one to another, we hope to provide some back-of-the-napkin guidelines to help with capacity planning. We also welcome suggestions on how to improve our benchmarking approach.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Workers get set to pour cement from a truck at the GO train station in Oakville, Ont., Tuesday, Jan.28, 2020. A new report by the Angus Reid Institute suggests the majority of Canadians support the idea of a shorter work week. (Richard Buchan/THE CANADIAN PRESS)</p><div>
                    <p>Support for the idea of a shorter work week is growing in popularity in Canada as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to upend the working lives of Canadians, according to a <a href="http://angusreid.org/four-day-work-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study by the Angus Reid Institute</a>.</p>
<p>More than half of Canadians (53 per cent) surveyed by the non-profit research centre said it would be a good idea to make a new 30-hour work week standard in Canada, the study found.</p>
<p>That’s a six-point increase compared to 2018 and more than twice the number of people who feel the present 40-hour workweek is just fine, the survey said.</p>
<p>Researchers at the institute speculate that the increase in support for a shorter workweek is perhaps driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and difficulties it has presented for many out of work Canadians.</p>
<p>The proportion of supporters of a 30-hour workweek rises to 58 per cent among those who have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. This is eight-points higher than those who have not applied for the program, the study found.</p>
<p>Support for a shorter workweek is highest at the lowest levels of household income (64 per cent) and lowest among those with incomes over $150,000 per year (47 per cent).</p>
<p>Past Conservative voters are the most fervent in their opposition to the idea of a shorter workweek.</p>
<p>This group is most likely to say that shortening the work week is an ill-conceived idea, 40 per cent feel this way, while two-thirds of past Liberal and New Democratic Party voters voice support for the measure.</p>
<h5>‘An interesting notion’</h5>
<p>Ricardo Tranjan, senior researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said “30 for 40”, thirty hours work for forty hours pay, is an interesting notion, and one that should be widely discussed, even beyond the COVID-19 context.</p>
<p>Shorter working weeks would allow workers to participate more actively in their children’s education, spend more time caring for their own parents and engage in leisure and physical activities that would have a positive impact on their health, Tranjan said.</p>
<p>Ten additional hours at home could go a long way in alleviating “double shifts,” which burden women disproportionately more than men, he said.</p>
<p>“But I have two critical concerns,” Tranjan said. “First, this can’t happen unless wages are adequate. We would absolutely need to maintain the same wage levels for shorter weeks, but for some workers, that wouldn’t be enough.”</p>
<p>People who work 40 hours a week at the minimum wage are very likely to have household incomes close to the poverty line, he said.</p>
<p>“If we reduce hours for these workers, they’re likely to pick up extra shifts, hoping that will allow them to afford things like new winter jackets for the kids or more and healthier food for the family,” Tranjan said.</p>
<p>“Meantime, higher-wage workers will be enjoying all the benefits of shorter weeks, so we’ll be just exacerbating social inequalities.”</p>
<p>Tranjan said his second concern has to do with eligibility for income supports, which is often tied to working hours.</p>
<p>“For example, will employment insurance eligibility be reduced if weeks are reduced? Or will we end up with even fewer people qualifying for EI benefits?” Tranjan said. “We need to tackle these questions heads on, but we should continue to have this conversation.”</p>
<h5>Business owners not buying it</h5>
<p>Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), which has more than 100,000 members, said it should surprise no one that the majority of Canadians like the idea of a four-day work week.</p>
<p>“The only people who would say no to such an idea are those that immediately recognize that this would likely require a 20 per cent reduction in their weekly pay or the massive unemployment that would occur if businesses were required to pay the same for fewer working hours,” Kelly said. “I would like six months of vacation and double my salary – that doesn’t mean it would be a reasonable request.”</p>
<p>Half of small Canadian businesses remain fully or partially closed due to the pandemic and most of those open now will be losing money every week they are open for months and months ahead, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Businesses have been hit with multiple months of lost productivity, rising debt and the costs of the personal protective equipment they now have to procure, Kelly said.</p>
<p>“Shorter work weeks at the same rate of pay for their staff would be an impossibility for nearly every business at this time,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Twelve per cent of independent businesses report they are considering winding down or going bankrupt, he added.</p>
<p>“There could be 100,000 fewer small businesses before this is over,” Kelly said. “Let’s not push that number even higher.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Server cost is usually not a concern for most funded startups, but for a boot strapped SaaS product like ours,&nbsp; it was important to have an AWS bill that is easy on the pocket and a little more proportional to the MRR.</p><p>‍</p><p>To that end when we started<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> superlemon.xyz</a> one of the first things I did was to find ways to consume the least amount of resources on the cloud. We currently serve a traffic of ~ 250 requests per second with our AWS setup.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Most applications require certain common cloud resources and these include</p><p>‍<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Compute instances</li><li>Database instances</li><li>Caching instances</li><li>CDN&nbsp;</li><li>A web server that acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><div><p>I will now go through each of these resources and talk about both the expensive way and the cheap way to implement them</p></div><p><strong>Compute instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>When it comes to compute instances, most people go with AWS EC2 instances. EC2 instances are the safest choice to make for running server applications as they are highly configurable, scalable and you can change the configuration on demand according to your needs. However, sometimes you do not really need this level of control on your compute instances and that brings us to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/" target="_blank">AWS Lightsail</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Lightsail as the name suggests is a lightweight version of EC2. Under the hood Lightsail instances are actually EC2 instances, but this is not apparent to the user and unlike the highly configurable EC2, Lightsail comes with a fixed configuration that once you provision cannot be changed. The billing is also a fixed amount per month as opposed to EC2 which is billed by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To give you a sense of how much less complicated Lightsail is, please take a look at these screenshots of the EC2 dashboard and Lightsail dashboard.</p><figure id="w-node-7afe1c2bdee3-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef82a451ea3cd05dfd4c146_x93boOZlEeQGL9kcVSXPZyGOX3SNQJfDNyRC0qG3jNDCYeySdZpIgBzYgkVDZqq3DhR92f_Eqdp8sG-vIgkwltIW9ExWhshfDSsb-gd2qCah6E5VjydVhGxO4QFRA5qCR2KXqhP5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-2074947a61a8-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef737f4a33047deb1c0a4a6_ZMr0t2QqxGgPZ-Grg-TIHjpok_ujhoYzyHLQnsGzlSfLJj0wRrKWFMKNnVDwCoOorYJHs6j4aqKz_NgztOFGNSNc9Fw4nKGrwSRVK7E4hQtDkzE7OXIVaQp0lDjXxwjiKkHN1e3c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>EC2 dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>But we are not here to debate the complexity of EC2 vs Lightsail, so let’s let us talk about the cost.</p><p>An EC2 instance with 2 virtual cores, 4GB RAM and a storage of 80GB costs roughly 37$ a month and a Lightsail instance with the exact same configuration costs 20$ a month which is almost half the cost!</p><p>‍<br></p><p>The only drawback here as previously mentioned is that the instance is fixed and neither the storage nor the compute power can be tweaked later according to spikes in traffic and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>In our case we do not have a need for too much storage on the compute instance, and as for the computing power it was easy for us to simply provision another Lightsail instance when there is an increase in traffic and set it up behind a load balancer. This way our system is still scalable.</p><p><strong>Database instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Choosing a database provider for your application can be a tricky decision, but on a high level there is just one thing that is absolutely required for any database provider - the ability to take regular backups of the DB automatically and the ability to restore the database from one of the backups.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this functionality is provided by AWS RDS along with an array of other capabilities like autoscaling of storage, multiple availability zones, etc. However we did not not really need this level of control over the DB for our simple SaaS product, not to mention the fact that RDS would cost us a minimum of 200$ a month with the lowest acceptable configuration.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again our saviour was Lightsail which provides managed Databases with a fixed storage at very cheap prices. Only MySQL and PostgreSQL are available though which was fine with us since I am quite comfortable with MySQL. We have currently provisioned one MySQL DB with 2 vCPUS, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD and it costs us 60$ a month.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>And as mentioned before Lightsail provides the basic capabilities of backups and restoration.</p><figure id="w-node-e1f43dee380f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef731c812136072299e133c_Q2n6wprxbcqgh5vI97YqjWYkOYV52HGzRtHXIQFfpgxwlHkGaO8YDv3aO3V-PwM2SI4qxPty6ZMlK0siv1-lAizSl9hf_6RASDqzNrSfEmIeMdu8UeSTsRhu4Sk1Ofg6Uw8CPPuK.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Database restoration from recent backup</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>The drawback here is that the DB will not scale automatically so your will have to make sure that your application does not use storage beyond what is available in the instance you select. We do this by regularly purging our Database of data that is older than X days and data that belongs to users who churned from our app more than X days ago and haven’t come back since.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Caching instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>For our application we needed a Caching layer as well as the ability to queue up jobs that can be executed asynchronously. The seasoned folks here might have realised that the best tool to use for this is Redis and AWS has a service called ElastiCache which is Redis under the hood.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again this would be a very safe choice to make because it is completely managed and scalable. Our need was a Redis instance with at least 6GB of memory and 2vCPUs and if we went with ElastiCache our cost would roughly come out to be 112$ a month, not to mention the additional cost of running our async workers somewhere else.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>I might sound like a broken record at this point but what we ended up doing was to provision a Lightsail instance with 2vCPUs and 8GB of memory for the cost of 40$ a month and installed an open source version of Redis on this instance. We also use the same instance to run our asynchronous workers which read from the Redis queue and execute jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So what is the drawback? Well since it is not a managed service, you would have to monitor the Redis server yourself. There are many tools out there that help you do this and the one I would recommend is<a href="http://prometheus.io/" target="_blank"> prometheus.io</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This means that you have to do a little bit of extra work to setup metrics collection from your Redis instance and use a grafana dashboard where you can view these metrics, but this extra work saves a lot of money in the long run and you get to look at a super cool dashboard like this one</p><figure id="w-node-ed9ef23d383f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b6832df460f9189c1ef_8fAYGJqB0CXvglSTkg-wXPXqpKi2e3fusNyMcOaiepfnZ-dC1kjn2Do44sILw5lbKOSISB1CMTEdCzyqBcyggDwK4tJcDEA17xkWXb2J1tUjLHBJgtMa_t3ekfIUfOiImx5IaZd6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Grafana dashboard for monitoring redis instance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>CDN</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Our application requires a javascript file to be loaded into the websites of our customers. This JS file gets a ton of traffic because this traffic scales according to how many visitors our customers get. Now this can be scary because it means we really had no idea how many requests the JS file might actually end up receiving so we hesitated to go with CloudFront which is the goto solution for a CDN on AWS.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So we ended up taking an entirely different approach for this. Our application is a Shopify app and during the process of building the application we created a Shopify store. Every Shopify store gets its own personal CDN where you can manually upload anything and it will be served over the Shopify CDN. So we minified and uploaded our JS file to the CDN of our Shopify store and now we serve 20000 Shopify stores using this method at zero cost.</p><figure id="w-node-78b80f124ebd-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b68374cfd3932d127f5_z2vfALB6_5FJXMp4al-65PIczwKOE-wUb0TubqBXAFMiu0rnqPEKGAOl12Saf0Xn-Ay1DjWL7wIj7Vby1sNPfLHkpuXzHf17ytoJ5gQvql13DZl1BsIV2rJPeHgfnCnIdezWiddG.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Shopify CDN&nbsp;that is free of cost</figcaption></figure><p>There is a glaring drawback to this approach. The Shopify store CDN does not provide an API that you can use to programmatically upload files and it has to be done manually. Also unlike CloudFront, there is no option of invalidating a file once it is uploaded. So If you have to make updates to your file you would have to upload a new file and migrate all of your existing users to this new file.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This might sound like a big drawback, but it actually took me an hour to whip up a script that updates the JS file for all our existing 20000 stores to the updated JS file that I provide. So whenever I make a new release to this JS file, I simply upload a new file manually to the CDN, then take that file as the input and run this script and we re live! This approach works for us because we do not make too many releases to the JS&nbsp;file to begin with.</p><p><strong>Web server + load balancer</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Every application requires the ability to route requests coming to their domain or subdomain to various applications running under the hood. The best way to do this is to use AWS ELB which can be used to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This sounds quite fancy, but all we needed for our product was 4 things</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Serving static files for our application dashboard</li><li>Distribute traffic among different Lightsail instances based on the path of the incoming URL</li><li>Load balance traffic that comes from our Merchants Shopify stores amongst N identical Lightsail instances.</li><li>Rate limiting of requests to prevent DDOS attacks.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this can be done using NGINX which is a great piece of software and is quite robust even with the default settings that it comes with.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we simply installed a stable version of NGINX on one of our existing Lightsail instances which was already being used to host one of our server applications. We also use<a href="http://amplify.nginx.com/" target="_blank"> amplify.nginx.com</a> for monitoring it. This setup is pretty much equivalent to using a managed service at zero cost.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-26b2c44e15ee-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef730c34b26677e785fa7ea_w67-tKkFsy_LekSEhO_PXqnHGxDiREqENBgMBaEAOqotyjEDJoKXRk6Wpd5K86OOv2z_S-ejGOnL37l6lj6MWqE_x2ZvrIZ4FCQraAC1uDWMne7yi0Fme4Jap2sp2uH2zrKdvpTz.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Amplify dashboard for monitoring health of the NGINX server</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Use lightsail instances (20$ per instance) instead of EC2 instances (37$ per instance)</li><li>Use a lightsail database (60$ per DB) instead of RDS (200$ per DB)</li><li>Use a self hosted redis server on a compute instance (40$) instead of ElastiCache (112$)&nbsp;</li><li>If feasible, use a free CDN (cost savings depends on traffic size)</li><li>Use a self hosted NGINX server (20$ fixed cost) instead of ELB (cost depends on traffic and usage)</li></ul><p><strong>Closing notes</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I would like to put emphasis on the fact that we are a micro-SaaS product that solves a small and specific use case and therefore this kind of AWS setup worked for us. This may not work for big organisations or products where the traffic is erratic.&nbsp;</p><p>This setup will also not work for folks who have a ton of stuff to do already and would prefer to use managed services and not take the additional headache of monitoring, maintaining and provisioning hardware resources on a regular basis because this has a time cost to it.</p><p>We are a team of 2 people with a product that is not computation heavy and has cloud requirements that are quite straightforward. We have been running this product for a little over 1 year with this AWS setup and so far we have not encountered any problems.</p></div></div>]]>

      <p>SwiftUI feels very young when it first announced last year in WWDC19. It shows a promising future, but it has a rough edge here and there, and it quite hard to predict what it will be like in a year. The year has passed, and here is my thought on Apple's new declarative UI framework SwiftUI.</p>
<h2 id="the-gap-is-getting-closer">The gap is getting closer <a href="#the-gap-is-getting-closer">#</a></h2>
<p>My arguments around SwiftUI are always like, "You can't do x (UIKit features) in SwiftUI". This year, Apple show an incredible pace of SwiftUI development. The missing UI elements from last year already have a SwiftUI counterpart, e.g., <code>UIColelctionView</code> and <code>UITextField</code> already have a SwiftUI counterpart of <code>LazyH/VGrid</code> and <code>TextEditor</code>.</p>
<h2 id="first-class-citizen">First-class citizen <a href="#first-class-citizen">#</a></h2>
<p>It looks like SwiftUI doesn't want to be just a view for UIKit anymore. Now, you can write an entire app using pure SwiftUI.</p>
<p>The following is a working SwiftUI app code.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>import</span> <span>SwiftUI</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@main</span><br><span><span>struct</span> <span>SwiftUIApp</span><span>:</span> <span>App</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> some <span>Scene</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>WindowGroup</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello! SwiftUI"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And the code above not just works on iOS, but the same code can make an iPad and Mac app. You can write a multiplatform app entirely with SwiftUI. Seem like the concepts of SwiftUI are far more powerful than I first thought.</p>
<h2 id="exclusive-deal">Exclusive Deal <a href="#exclusive-deal">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WidgetKit</a>, a new framework in iOS 14 for writing a Widget can only write using SwiftUI. This means you can't run away from it, even you love UIKit, it seems like you have no choice, but to also learn SwiftUI.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/29ba6373e9bf92bbbc301e0f6fb491f3cf51920a/819cd/images/swiftui-2-widget.png" alt="Widget">
  <figcaption>Widget</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="is-uikit-going-to-die%3F">Is UIKit going to die? <a href="#is-uikit-going-to-die%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>Nope, it is far from over. I don't think Apple has a plan to drop UIKit in the foreseeable future. As working on UIKit for years, SwiftUI feels like magic to me. It can replicate UIKit function with a single line of code (or no line of code since it builds right into SwiftUI). The bad thing about magic is that when things are not going as you want, it is hard to figure out what's wrong, and it might not be possible to fix it. That's when you need to go back to UIKit. UIKit is a foundation of iOS, and Apple still keeps adding new features to it (UICollectionView and UISplitViewController got a lot of cool features this year, you should check it out).</p>
<p>I see UIKit as a secret sauce behind all SwiftUI magic. Both UIKit and SwiftUI have their strength, and Apple picks the right tool for the right job (they use SwiftUI for WidgetKit because it suits the constraint that Widget has right now). I think these two will coexist for a very long time.</p>
<p>Apple put years of experience in their UIKit and tools into SwiftUI. It is enjoyable to work with, and the outcome is phenomenal. Apple can do this because they set up a way to bridge SwiftUI to UIKit, so they know that even when SwiftUI fails to do some tasks, there will always have UIKit there.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Here comes the important question. Should you learn UIKit or SwiftUI?</p>
<p>My short answer would be <strong>SwiftUI</strong>.</p>
<p>And here is my long answer. From all the facts I point out in this article, SwiftUI is ready now. I think in the end you would end up learning both of them.</p>
<p>If you know UIKit, you are forced to learn SwiftUI since it is exclusive to a new framework like WidgetKit. Even not for that reason, I think you probably the one who appreciates SwiftUI the most. SwiftUI can do many great things right out of the box, things that we always want to do in UIKit, but don't have the opportunity and time to do it.</p>
<p>If you know SwiftUI, there would be a time that you want extra customization or hit some roadblock. When the time comes, UIKit will always there for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantum entanglement has attracted some attention from the public that this mysterious process might be useful for lots of future applications, such as quantum computing and teleportation.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss quantum entanglement superficially using mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-entanglement">Quantum Entanglement</h3>

<p>Assume we have two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$, represented respectively by the vector spaces $\mathbb{V}$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime}$. The quantum system obtained by merging $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ will have the tensor product $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime}$ as a state space.</p>



<p>If $\mathbb{V} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ with basic states $| x_0 \rangle, | x_1 \rangle, \cdots, | x_{n-1} \rangle$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^m$ with basic states $| y_0 \rangle, | y_1 \rangle, \cdots, | y_{m-1} \rangle$, the tensor product state space would be $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times m}$ with basic states $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ and $0 \leq j \leq m-1$. Here, the basic state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ means the first quantum systems $Q$ is in the state $| x_i \rangle$ and the second quantum system $Q^{\prime}$ is in the state $| y_j \rangle$.</p>



<p>More independent quantum systems $Q_0, Q_1, \cdots, Q_{k-1}$ could be merged together and the state space of the merged quantum system would be $\mathbb{V}_0 \otimes \mathbb{V}_1 \otimes \cdots\ \otimes \mathbb{V}_{k-1}$.</p>



<p>The system state of the merged quantum system from two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ could be expressed using basic states.</p>



<p>The probability of the system being in the state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ after measurement, according to quantum mechanics, would be</p>



<p>If $c_{i,j} = 0$, then $P(| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle) = 0$</p>



<p>We further consider the merged system whose $n = 2$ and $m = 2$.</p>



<p>Suppose $c_{0,0} = 0$, $c_{0,1} = 1$, $c_{1,0} = 1$, $c_{1,1} = 0$, i.e.,</p>



<p>When we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| x_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle$. Similarly, when we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q^{\prime}$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| y_0 \rangle$ or $| y_1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>If we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_0 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_1 \rangle$ even without measurement. Similarly, if we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_1 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_0 \rangle$ even without measurement. This is because the probability of observing $| x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle$ is 0.</p>



<p>This is called quantum entanglement.</p>



<p>In this case, no matter how far the two subsystems in the entangled system is, we know the system states of both subsystems by just observing one single subsystem.</p>



<p>The quantum entanglement is simultaneous and instantaneous. If we describe this process using “velocity”, we would find the “velocity” is infinitely large, faster than light speed, which is the fastest “velocity” we are currently using for information transmission. However, we prefer not to describe this process using velocity, since it is not a conventional physical “travel” process.</p>



<p>Formally, if a merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ can be broken into the tensor product of states from the constituent subsystems, i.e.,</p>



<p>We call this merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ separable state. Otherwise we call it entangled state, as we would find there is no solution to solve the above equation for an entangled state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Some people who did not study physics sometimes described the process of quantum entanglement as if there is a causation relationship, which means that it is the state of one subsystem affecting the other subsystem. However, from our mathematics analysis, we know this causation relationship does not exist.</p>

            <span> Jun 26, 2020</span>

                <a href="https://blog.mostlypointless.dev/tags/raspberry-pi">raspberry pi</a>
            
        
        <p>Almost two months ago, I started building a four node Raspberry Pi 4 cluster for a project I’m working on. Figuring out the best way to get Linux on each node lead me down a rabbit hole and I spent the next four weeks <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html">yak shaving</a>.</p>
<p>The most common way to boot a Pi is from an SD card. But they are slow and unreliable - I don’t like them. Certain models of Pi 2 and Pi 3 support <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md">booting from USB storage</a>, but Pi 4 cannot do that yet. So, I’m stuck with using an SD card for each Pi. Or so I thought.</p>
<h3 id="enter-pxe-boot">Enter PXE boot</h3>
<p>Turns out, Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net.md">support network booting</a>. A beta firmware was released late last year that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a> for Pi 4. I found <a href="https://linuxhit.com/raspberry-pi-pxe-boot-netbooting-a-pi-4-without-an-sd-card">an article on LinuxHit</a> detailing the process of installing the firmware and setting up network boot.</p>
<p>Just to test this out, I updated the firmware and configured PXE server on one of the Pis. I tried booting another Pi over the network and…it worked!
Here is the gist of PXE server setup process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the contents of <code>/boot</code> and the rest of <code>/</code> into separate folders on your local filesystem. I copied mine to <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Install and configure <code>dnsmasq</code> to enable TFTP and use <code>/tftp</code> as <code>tftp-root</code></li>
<li>Install and configure NFS server to share <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code></li>
<li>Edit the contents of <code>/nfs/raspbian-root/fstab</code> to mount the boot partition.</li>
<li>Edit <code>/nfs/raspbian-boot/cmdline.txt</code> to</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/raspbian-root,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><h3 id="pxe-booting-3-nodes-using-overlayfs">PXE booting 3 nodes using OverlayFS</h3>
<p>I cannot just boot all three nodes from the same boot and root filesystems since they are not read-only. And I don’t want to maintain a copy of these for each node. But this is a solved problem - Docker already lets you spin up multiple containers from a single base image. So I’ll just do <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#how-the-overlay2-driver-works">what Docker does</a> - create <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html">OverlayFS</a> for each node using raspbian-root and raspbian-boot as my lower directories. I’ll share them over NFS like before.</p>
<p>Configuration for one of the nodes is below. Other two nodes follow the same pattern. Note that I moved raspbian-root and raspbian-boot to a USB hard drive (mounted at <code>/mnt</code>) to get better r/w performance. dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX is the MAC address of the node. I’m using <code>tftp-unique-root=mac</code> option in <code>dnsmasq</code> to maintain a separate boot environment for each node based on its MAC address.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mount -t overlay nog-boot -o lowerdir<span>=</span>/mnt/raspbian-boot,upperdir<span>=</span>/mnt/upper/nog-boot,workdir<span>=</span>/mnt/work/nog-boot -o nfs_export<span>=</span>on -o index<span>=</span>on -o redirect_dir<span>=</span>nofollow /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX

</code></pre></div><p>(In case you are wondering what <code>nog</code> is: I name my servers after planets from the Star Wars universe. Following this tradition, I’ve named the Pis Mandalore (PXE server), Nog, Ordo and Werda)</p>
<p>You are probably thinking that this worked. It did not.</p>
<p>NFS and OverlayFS did not play nice with each other. After a weekend trying to work around some weird issues, I gave up.</p>
<p>But OverlayFS is not the only copy-on-write filesystem in existence, is it? ZFS and BTRFS offer <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume">subvolumes and snapshots</a> that I can use instead. But not before I <del>procrastinate</del> spend 2 weeks deciding which one to use.</p>
<h3 id="moving-to-btrfs">Moving to BTRFS</h3>
<p>The plan is simple: I’ll create a subvolume each for raspbian-root and raspbian-boot. I’ll then create three snapshots of each subvolume - one for every node. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">btrfs file system</a> on my external drive and ran the following commands</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-root
$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-boot

<span># Repeat the following for each node changing folder names as necessary</span>
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-boot nog-boot
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-root nog-root
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-boot /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-root /nfs/nog

<span># Don’t forget to edit cmdline.txt for each node</span>
$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt
console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/nog,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><p>Well, this worked! I have a Pi running without an SD card!! Now all I have to do is create systemd unit files to start all required services and mount snapshots. I can finally start working on my project.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Take a closer look at the output of <code>cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.
If you are like me, you will realize for the first time that <code>root=</code> in this file defines where the root filesystem will be mounted from. Right now, we are telling it to mount from <code>/dev/nfs</code>. What if I attach an external drive and set <code>root=</code> to point to the external drive?</p>
<h3 id="network-booting-into-a-usb-hard-drive">Network booting into a USB hard drive</h3>
<p>RPi 4 cannot directly boot from a USB drive. As in - it cannot find <code>/boot</code> on a USB drive when powering on. But what if we provide <code>/boot</code> with network boot and mount <code>/</code> from a USB drive using <code>cmdline.txt</code>? Time to test.</p>
<p>I copied raspbian-root to a USB drive, edited <code>fstab</code> to mount <code>/</code> using the partition’s PARTUUID and connected it to Nog. I then updated the contents of <code>/tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt

</code></pre></div><p>After a couple of reboots, it worked! I now have a RPi 4 running off a USB hard drive!</p>
<h3 id="what-did-i-gain">What did I gain?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with what I was looking for. All I wanted was to not deal with SD cards because they are slow and unreliable. Reliability is relative - everything fails at some point. But a decent quality USB hard drive will likely outlive an SD card. So let’s just look at some read/write performance numbers and see how they compare.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sync; dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero of<span>=</span>twogeefile bs<span>=</span>1M count<span>=</span>2048; sync  <span># Write performance</span>

$ dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>twogeefile of<span>=</span>/dev/null bs<span>=</span>1M count<span>=</span><span>2048</span>              <span># Read performance</span>

<p>With network boot, I was able to get read and write speeds similar to a class 10 SD card. Note that the boot images are hosted on a USB hard drive connected to Mandalore (PXE server). NFS seems to be the bottleneck here - raw r/w speeds of the hard drive are much better than this. All Pis are connected to Netgear’s 8 port gigabit ethernet switch.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, things improve considerably when Pis are running off a USB hard disk. Note that the external drives I used are 5400RPM hard disks repurposed from very old MacBooks. I bought them on eBay for $10 a pop. YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="current-setup">Current setup</h3>
<p>Right now, I have Mandalore booting from an SD card and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk. Nog, Ordo and Werda fetch <code>/boot</code> from Mandalore over the network and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk.</p>

<p>I can finally start working on my proj… wait, what?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/boot-raspberry-pi-4-usb">A new beta firmware is out for RPi 4 that lets you boot from USB drives directly.</a></p>
<p>Oh well…</p>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This post was discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23666564">Hacker News</a>. As jordybg <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23667247">points out</a>, USB boot is no longer “beta” and is available in the latest (2020-06-15) “stable” firmware release.</em></p>

   <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
   <p>This specification uses pluggable protocols, with QUIC <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-quic-transport">[QUIC-TRANSPORT]</a> as
one such protocol, to send data to and receive data from servers. It can be
used like WebSockets but with support for multiple streams, unidirectional
streams, out-of-order delivery, and reliable as well as unreliable transport.</p>
   <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> The API presented in this specification represents a preliminary proposal
based on work-in-progress within the IETF QUIC WG. Since the QUIC transport
specification is a work-in-progress, both the protocol and API are likely to
change significantly going forward.</p>
   <h2 data-level="2" id="conformance"><span>2. </span><span>Conformance</span><a href="#conformance"></a></h2>
   <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines,
diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
   <p>The key words <em>MUST</em> and <em>SHOULD</em> are to be interpreted as described in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
   <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product:
the user agent that implements the interfaces that it contains.</p>
   <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
   <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this
specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript
Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-webidl">[WEBIDL]</a>, as this
specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

 many datagrams are queued because the stream is not being read quickly
 enough, drop datagrams to avoid queueing. Implementations should drop older
 datagrams in favor of newer datagrams. The number of datagrams to queue
 should be kept small enough to avoid adding significant latency to packet
 delivery when the stream is being read slowly (due to the reader being slow)
 but large enough to avoid dropping packets when for the stream is not read
 for short periods of time (due to the reader being paused).</p>

This is a <strong>quick</strong> overview about: the architecture, the components, the pain, the learning, the open source and etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>GER 7×1 BRA (yeah, we’re not proud of it)</li>
<li>0.5M&nbsp;simultaneous&nbsp;users @ a single game – ARG x SUI</li>
<li>580Gbps @ a single game – ARG x SUI</li>
<li>=~ 1600 watched years @ the whole event</li>
</ul>

<p>The project was to receive an input stream, generate&nbsp;<a title="hls" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming" target="_blank">HLS</a>&nbsp;output stream for hundreds of&nbsp;thousands and to&nbsp;provide a great experience for final users:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch the RTMP input stream</li>
<li>Generate HLS and send it&nbsp;to <a title="cassandra" href="http://cassandra.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cassandra</a></li>
<li>Fetch binary and meta data from Cassandra and rebuild the HLS playlists with Nginx+lua</li>
<li>Serve and cache the live content&nbsp;in a <a title="how to learn high scalability" href="http://leandromoreira.com.br/2014/11/20/how-to-start-to-learn-high-scalability/" target="_blank">scalable way</a></li>
<li>Design and implement the player</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to understand why we chose HLS&nbsp;check&nbsp;<a title="Live Streaming @ Globo.com" href="http://www.slideshare.net/leandro_moreira/fisl15-streaming-de-video-ao-vivo-na-globocom" target="_blank">this presentation only in pt-BR</a>. <strong>tip</strong>:&nbsp;sometimes we need to rebuild some things from scratch.</p>

<p>The live stream comes to our servers&nbsp;as <a title="rtmp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol" target="_blank">RTMP</a> and we were using <a title="ems" href="https://evostream.com/" target="_blank">EvoStream</a> (now we’re moving to <a title="nginx-rtmp" href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module" target="_blank">nginx-rtmp</a>) to <strong>receive this input and to generate HLS</strong>&nbsp;output to&nbsp;a <strong>known folder</strong>. Then we have some<strong>&nbsp;python daemons</strong>, running at the same machine, <strong>watching this known folder</strong> and <a title="python m3u8" href="https://github.com/globocom/m3u8" target="_blank">parsing the m3u8</a> and&nbsp;<strong>posting&nbsp;the&nbsp;data&nbsp;to Cassandra</strong>.</p>
<p>To watch files modification and to be notified by these events, we first tried watchdog but for some reason we weren’t able to make it work as fast as we expected and we changed to&nbsp;pyinotify.</p>
<p>Another challenge we had to overcome was to make the&nbsp;python program scale to x&nbsp;cpu cores, we ended up by creating multiple Python processes and using <a title="cassandra async" href="http://datastax.github.io/python-driver/api/cassandra/cluster.html#cassandra.cluster.Session.execute_async" target="_blank">async execution</a>.</p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>:&nbsp;maybe the best language / tool <a title="joke another castle" href="http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/05/27/your-princess-is-in-another-castle-misogyny-entitlement-and-nerds/jcr:content/image.crop.800.500.jpg/1405354940376.cached.jpg" target="_blank">is in another castle</a>.</p>

<p>We previously were using Redis to store the live stream data&nbsp;<a title="moving from redis to cassandra" href="http://planetcassandra.org/blog/interview/globo-rewinds-redis-for-their-dvr-system-fast-forwards-to-apache-cassandra-for-increased-availability/" target="_blank">but we thought&nbsp;Cassandra was needed</a>&nbsp;to offer DVR functionality easily (although we still uses&nbsp;Redis a lot). Cassandra response time was increasing with load&nbsp;to&nbsp;a certain point where&nbsp;clients started to timeout and the video playback completely stopped.</p>
<p>We were using it as <a title="cassandra anti-pattern" href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cassandra-anti-patterns-queues-and-queue-like-datasets" target="_blank">Queue-like</a> which turns out to be a anti-pattern. We then denormalized our data and also changed to <a href="http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/tabProp.html?scroll=tabProp__moreCompaction" target="_blank">LeveledCompactionStrategy</a> as well as we set <strong>durable_writes</strong> to false, since we could treat our live stream as ephemeral data.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, but most importantly, since we knew the maximum size a playlist could have, we could specify the start column (filtering with id &gt; minTimeuuid(now – playlist_duration)). This really mitigated the effect of tombstones for reads. After these changes, we were able to achieve a <strong>latency in the order of 10ms</strong> for our 99% percentile.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: limit your queries + denormalize your data&nbsp;+ <a href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/pluggable-metrics-reporting-in-cassandra-2-0-2" target="_blank">send instrumentation data to graphite</a> + use SSD.</p>

<p>With all the data and meta-data we could build the HLS manifest and serve the video chunks.&nbsp;The only thing we were struggling was that we didn’t want to add an extra server to fetch and build the manifests.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;we already had&nbsp;invested a lot of effort into&nbsp;<a title="nginx + lua" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pushing-nginx-to-its-limit-with-lua/" target="_blank">Nginx+Lua</a>, we thought it could be possible to use lua to fetch and build the manifest. It was a matter of building a <a title="cassandra lua driver" href="https://github.com/jbochi/lua-resty-cassandra" target="_blank">lua driver for Cassandra</a> and use it. One good thing about this approach (rebuilding the manifest) was that in the end we realized that we were almost ready to serve <a title="dash" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP" target="_blank">DASH</a>.</p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: <a title="busted" href="https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/busted" target="_blank">test your lua scripts</a> + check the&nbsp;lua global vars + <a title="cache stale" href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_use_stale" target="_blank">double check your caching&nbsp;config</a></p>

<p>In order to provide a better experience, we chose to build <a title="brief explanation about clappr" href="http://blog.flavioribeiro.com/clappr-an-extensible-media-player-for-the-web/" target="_blank">Clappr</a>, an extensible open-source HTML5 video player. With Clappr – and a few custom extensions like PiP (Picture In Picture) and Multi-angle replays – we were able to deliver a great experience to our users. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.flavioribeiro.com/content/images/2014/Nov/06_player_multicamera-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: open source it from day 0 + follow to flow issue&nbsp;-&gt; commit FIX#123</p>

<p>To keep an eye over all these system, we built a monitoring dashboard using&nbsp;mostly open source projects like: logstash, elastic search, graphite, graphana, kibana, seyren, angular, mongo, redis, rails and many others. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/image.slidesharecdn.com/fisl15-streamingdevideoaovivonaglobo-140509123535-phpapp01/95/fisl15-streaming-de-video-ao-vivo-na-globocom-22-638.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="359"></p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: use SSD for graphite and elasticsearch</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" id="item-5ef7bc76e6aaf04d0e009f94"><div><div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-af03afdb075005d5c151"><div><p>Like many software engineers in the industry, I don't have a Computer Science degree.
I spent my college years in music school, doing an undergraduate degree in jazz guitar performance and most of a graduate degree in music technology.
I've had the conversation about how music is like software a few times, and recently <a href="https://twitter.com/CatMcGeeCode/status/1272097365764300802?s=20">this tweet</a> got me reflecting about the things I apply in my technology career that I learned in music school.
While I might not have gone on to be a professional musician, it turns out that music school taught me many things that I still find valuable today.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the (important) fundamentals</strong></p>
<p>Few classes in the traditional music school curriculum are as polarizing as the pair of music theory and ear training.
In a music theory class, you study the structural underpinnings of what most people refer to as Classical Music¹, and ear training is where you teach your brain to put names to the sounds that your ears hear.
I personally loved music theory and wasn't fond of ear training, and in hindsight I should have worked harder on the latter and less on the former.
Music theory tickled the same part of my brain that programming does because it's all about breaking down structures into understandable units, giving names to abstract concepts, categorization, and analysis.
In short, it's a puzzle, and it almost certainly didn't make me a better musician².
At no point when creating improvised music do you have time to think "haha, I know, I'll use an altered dominant chord here, that'll be great," and if you do you're likely not listening to the people you're playing with very closely.
Instead, you hear a sound in your head, and at the best of times your brain knows exactly how to translate that into notes on your instrument.
As you probably guessed, the class that teaches that is the one that I wasn't particularly fond of.</p>
<p>There's a similar split in usefulness when dealing with the fundamentals of programming and Compute Science.
Is it important that the average programmer can rattle off the finer points of Von Neumman architecture?
Probably not.
But it's infinitely useful to be able to pattern match problems against known-good patterns for solving them.
If I can see that a problem models well as a finite state machine in a funny hat, then a good portion of solving the problem is already done for me.
The useful fundamentals are the ones that build your ability to pattern match a problem against a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Practice what you don't know</strong></p>
<p>There's a not-so-fine line between practicing and playing what you already know is going to sound good on your instrument.
The former involves meticulously working on making new musical concepts familiar, and the latter generally sounds good.
"Noodling" on one's instrument is fun, but it's not likely to make you much better³.
In contrast, practicing new songs, scales, etc. will almost certainly make you a better musician overall.
It will just as certainly sound terrible until you've worked on it for far longer than is likely comfortable.
A little-known fact about being a professional musician is that you spend most of it sounding terrible in private so that you sound good in public.</p>
<p>There's a particular type of musician⁴ who spends all of their time running scales that they already know at faster and faster speeds.
When they play on stage you can tell what they've practiced, because their music consists of scales played really really fast.
There's a certain physicality to that that's impressive, but I've never particularly found it musically interesting.
Likewise, if I spend my career going company to company building the same application, I'm likely not to grow much as an engineer after a certain point.
It's totally reasonable to become a master at building a particular kind of thing, and I'd never begrudge anyone the economic security that can come with being able to build something that companies need really fast because you've done it a hundred times, but it's important to recognize that that's likely <em>not</em> a path towards building one's technical chops.
If you want to get better, sometimes you have to do something new.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to others</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I look back on most fondly about music school is its culture of sharing influences.
A frequent topic of conversation is what you and your friends are listening to, and what ideas you're taking from them.
The best musicians I know take in a wide variety of influences and find things to appreciate about music they don't necessarily like.
Most programmers--myself included--could stand to do more of that.
Explore outside of your own ecosystem, and if you find yourself less-than-enamored with a language or tool, try to find some good ideas in it.</p>
<p><strong>Learn your history</strong></p>
<p>From talking with people who have done them, one thing that music school does better than CS programs is the study of the history of the field⁵.
Every music school student is required to take a certain number of music history courses, and composition students--the Enterprise Architects of the music world--generally have a pretty firm understanding of when they're being imitative vs innovative.
And even in the most basic history classes--the kind that non-majors take when they think it's going to be an easy elective, not realizing that the tests are basically a game of music trivia where you've just heard all of the songs for the first time this week--there's at least an attempt to contextualize innovation even if it sounds old to us now.</p>
<p>I took a history of opera class as a sophomore, and at no point was Verdi referred to as "legacy" or "deprecated"⁶.
Contrast that with how history is viewed in tech, if it's learned at all.
Chapters in a history book written by the comments sections of popular tech industry sites would contain passages like "HTTP was originally developed by Tim Berners Lee at CERN in 1989, but no one uses that anymore because Google came out with gRPC and it's much more performant."
Taking the time to learn and contextualize the history of programming languages and tools will almost always make you better at assessing new technologies and techniques.</p>
<p><strong>There's no substitute for learning from an expert</strong></p>
<p>I was mostly a self taught guitar player until my first semester of music school, and I'm pretty sure that I improved more in those first few months than at any other point.
Experts who are good teachers will be able to watch you play and pick out the one thing that you need to do right now to improve, and then give you a bunch of other things to work on that will keep you improving for months.
You can teach yourself a lot of things, both in music and in programming, but there's no substitute for sitting down one on one with an expert and learning from them, even if you don't do it regularly.</p>
<p>If you have the chance to pair program with an expert, do it, and ask for feedback.
One of the best pairing experiences that I've ever had was with my former colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/jmileham">John Mileham</a>, who at the time was the head of architecture and interim lead of the security team at the company that we worked for.
He was working on some security code written in Go, and because I had a burgeoning interest in the language he was nice enough to invite me to pair on it together.
I was "driving", and after we implemented the feature I went through my normal process of interactively adding chunks to the git diff with <code>git add -p</code>.
After I added the second or third diff, he stopped me and said something to the effect of "Can I make an observation? You go way too fast when you code."
It was feedback that I'd never received before, and it was exactly what I needed to hear to get better.
I'd gotten to the point where I was a relatively competent programmer, but made mistakes often enough because I didn't slow down to consider code before committing it, and nobody had sat with me to watch me code so it just seemed like I was careless.
If I hadn't gotten that one on one time with an expert, I likely would have kept making the same mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching others makes you better</strong></p>
<p>One of the hardest things I've ever tried to do is teach the difference between major and minor to a child learning to play the guitar.
While programming as a career tends to be a fairly applied discipline, its foundations are largely mathematical, and that shows when you're able to explain things with relatively precise language without too many exceptions.
In contrast, major and minor are labels that were applied to patterns of sounds long after they were in common use, and as such basically every explanation has some sort of exception to it.
Major is happy, except that "happy" isn't really a universal reaction, and some "major modes" are more "floaty" or "bluesy," and the sound of a chord is all contextual anyway so major after minor might be interpreted as "triumphant" or "ironic" instead of happy, and so on.
Every explanation besides the technical one is squishy and filled with squishy exceptions, and the technical one is both likely to be uninteresting to a child--and most adults--and won't help them be a better musician.</p>
<p>Having to come up with these explanations gave me a much better understanding of the thing I was explaining, and the same is true of programming.
When you learn something, one of the barometers for how well you've learned it is how well you can teach it to others.
If you really want to learn something well, schedule a talk about it some number of weeks in the future.
It doesn't have to be a high-stakes speaking engagement; a lunch and learn with your team arguably works better.
During the course of practicing your talk, act out audience questions and regularly check in with yourself as to whether you're parroting phrases or really understand them.
By the time you give your talk, you'll either know the topic well, or be able to identify where you need more study.</p>
<p><strong>Know your audience</strong></p>
<p>Ask any working musician to play a "wedding gig," and they'll know exactly what you mean: show up early, dress nicely, …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with security by default. Deno tends to substitute Node.js with a simpler, modern, and more secure runtime.</p>
<p>Deno is built on V8, Rust, and <a href="https://tokio.rs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tokio homepage">Tokio</a>, a Rust asynchronous runtime environment. It aims to be a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern world of programming, Deno is for you!</p>
<p>If you want to learn Deno you are in the right section.</p>
<p>Our Deno tutorial is designed for simplicity. We also have tons of examples to get you in the game.</p>
<h2>Deno Example Code</h2>
<pre><code>function generateRandom(max_number) {
  return Math.ceil(Math.random() * max_number);
}

console.log(generateRandom(5));</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://lyty.dev/diy/deno-typescript-random-number-example.html" target="_blank"><i>launch</i>&nbsp; Do It Yourself</a></p>
<h2>What Can Deno Do?</h2>
<p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime environment, this means that you can use Deno to process server-side actions by writing JavaScript or TypeScript. Think of anything that other server-side programming languages can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deno can <strong>serve</strong> web pages dynamically (like PHP, NodeJS, ASP, and other server-side languages).</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>create</strong>, <strong>open</strong>, <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>, <strong>delete</strong>, and <strong>close</strong> files on the server</li>
<li>Deno can be used to <strong>build</strong> command-line based applications</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>interact</strong> with any kind of database</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Use Deno?</h2>
<p>Think of anything other server-side programming languages can do, then think <strong>security</strong>, <strong>simplicity</strong>, and <strong>modernization </strong>with Deno.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security by default. No file, network, or environment access (unless explicitly enabled).</li>
<li>It is a TypeScript runtime, which means it supports TypeScript out of the box.</li>
<li>Comes with a single executable (<code>deno</code>).</li>
<li>Ships with built-in tools that make code inspection and formatting easy,&nbsp; the <code>deno info</code> and <code>deno fmt</code>.</li>
<li>You can bundle scripts into a single JavaScript file and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who Can Learn Deno?</h2>
<p>Deno can be learned by anyone, provided that you have the basic knowledge of <strong>JavaScript </strong>especially about <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>
<h2>Comparisons to Node.js</h2>
<div><table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Deno</td>
<td>NodeJS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No package manager. Uses modules referenced as URLs or file paths</td>
<td>Has a package manager called <code>npm</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno does not use <code>package.json</code> in its module resolution algorithm</td>
<td>Uses <code>package.json</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All async actions in Deno return a promise. Thus Deno provides different APIs than Node.</td>
<td>In Node.js, async can be promise or function-based</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno requires explicit permissions for file, network, and environment access (for security purposes).</td>
<td>Node.js does not require this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno always dies (exits) on uncaught errors</td>
<td>Node.js may not die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uses "ES Modules" and does not support <code>require()</code>. Third-party modules are imported via URLs: <code>import * as log from "https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts";</code></td>
<td>Node.js uses both <code>require()</code> and the ES <code>import</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>You can start our Deno Tutorial by clicking the 'Next Chapter' button below.</p>
<h2>What You Should Know at the End of This Lesson</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should understand when <strong>Deno</strong> is.</li>
<li>You should understand the core value of <strong>Deno </strong>(security, speed, and modern).</li>
<li>You should know that <strong>Deno </strong>is TypeScript-code and the standard file extensions are <code>.js</code> and&nbsp;<code>.ts</code></li>
</ul>

            <p>OSLO, NORWAY -- 
	Norway began work on Friday to excavate the first Viking ship to be unearthed in the country in more than a century, with experts hoping it will shed light on the era of the Nordic seafarers.</p>
<p>
	Ground-penetrating radar detected the ancient vessel, buried about 50cm below ground in a mound covering a burial site, in 2018 in the south east near the Swedish border.</p>
<p>
	Initial observations suggested the remains were in very bad shape, forcing the authorities to launch excavations quickly before the ship was completely degraded.</p>
<p>
	Only three well-preserved Viking ships have been found in Norway, the last excavation dating back to 1904. All three are now on display in a museum near Oslo.</p>
<p>
	"With so few ships discovered, a new Viking ship will have a great impact on understanding the ships themselves, but also provide valuable information to understand the historical era as a whole," said archaeologist Knut Paasche of the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research.</p>
<p>
	Viking warriors and merchants who sailed the seas between the eighth and eleventh centuries often buried kings and dignitaries with ships hoisted ashore.</p>
<p>
	"The Gjellestad ship is a discovery of outstanding national and international importance," said Culture Minister Sveinung Rotevatn.</p>
<p>
	The excavation is expected to last five months.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>It's a bit of a counterpoint.</p><p>I am a tech entrepreneur. I am supposed to dream Hypergrowth.</p><p>But lately, disturbed as I am with 2020 itself, I started to think - why are things the way they are. </p><h2 id="two-types-of-companies">Two Types of Companies</h2><p>There are two types of companies. Those that are designed to create wealth for founders and employees, and the others designed to create wealth for a Fund. Don't get me wrong - most companies end up doing neither - and some will do both. But every company is <em>designed</em> to do ONE and ONLY ONE of those things.</p><p>This is not just my opinion.</p><p>Paul Graham wrote in "Startup = Growth" that a startup is a company <em>designed</em> to grow very fast. One question to ask is - to what destination exactly? And why should a company <em>want</em> to grow so fast?</p><p>Let's try to unpack Hypergrowth. And let's borrow the framework from Daniel Kahneman, to do so.</p><h2 id="hypergrowth-tickles-the-market-s-fast-thinking-brain">Hypergrowth Tickles the Market's Fast Thinking Brain</h2><p>Hypergrowth is the business equivalent of your fast brain - the market reacts as if by instinct. Growing &nbsp;fast helps the company cover a good market share before competitors take note and 'copy-cats' come into the picture. Growing fast leads to a new behaviour (or a slight modification in the old one) getting adopted by a very large number of people, in a pretty short time. </p><h3 id="just-f-g-download-the-app-stop-thinking">Just F*****G Download The App, Stop Thinking</h3><p>The slow brain of the market would pause, think, analyse, and might decide NOT to adopt the new behaviour. It might ask questions about privacy, addiction, security, safety, life ... the fast brain of the market does not analyse. </p><p>It jumps instinctively to the shiny new app because it's trendy to do so. From a business perspective, you do not want the market to critique what you have built, you want them to adopt it.</p><p>What happens when the slow brain does kick in and start asking questions later? By that time, the behaviour is so well set, that it is hard to break. So it is likely to stick. Think about people criticising, and then using Facebook. As if they're addicted.</p><blockquote>Without hypergrowth and it's related behavioural sciences, we would still have Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, but probably with lesser adoption, and in slightly different avatars.</blockquote><h2 id="hypergrowth-leads-to-winner-take-all-markets">Hypergrowth Leads to Winner Take All Markets</h2><p>Another thing that hypergrowth helps do is make money. To understand what speed has got to do with capital, we need to understand <em>Extrapolation</em>.</p><p>We love to extrapolate. From debates about race, to forest fires to climate change - everywhere you can see this happening. An easy way to detect careless extrapolation is the phrase "at this rate ... X will happen" - assuming that "the rate" is a universal constant.</p><p>We love extrapolation so much, that with took this word and created a special symbol to represent it. And then we made it the most important symbol of modern times. That symbol, of course is "@" or "at the rate of.." . Yeah yeah. I know, it was meant for some other purpose - but even in the old definition, the rate is implied to be a constant - even if for a small duration. But I digress.</p><p>So extrapolation.</p><p>This is how it works - you grow fast - say 8x a year. That growth 'activates' a multiplier to your valuation in the private markets. That multiplier is super handy because as larger and larger funds get in on the action, smaller investors are able to exit at a profit.</p><p>And it's all great except for one thing - it creates Winner Take All markets.</p><h3 id="stop-minding-your-business-and-come-work-for-me">Stop Minding Your Business and Come Work For Me</h3><p>Hypergrowth, when adopted at large scale, creates 'Winner Take All' markets. In these markets, every small company that does something similar to the big guy, tends to die out. This leads to a large number of people, who were literally minding their own businesses, to crash, burn and work for the large corporations. </p><p>Do a few cycles of this, over a few decades, and you get an economy that is seriously debt ridden, afraid that even the remaining jobs will be taken away in the name of innovation. This society responds with mass scale knee-jerk reactions, even if for the right causes. This society gets divided into "Heroes" and "Zeroes". And when there are enough Zeroes and they are unhappy enough, it's easy for chaos to ensue. An incompetent leadership is just an icing on the cake.</p><blockquote><strong>This society responds with mass scale knee-jerk reactions, even if for the right causes. This society gets divided into "Heroes" and "Zeroes". And when there are enough Zeroes and they are unhappy enough, it's easy for chaos to ensue. An incompetent leadership is just the icing on the cake.</strong></blockquote><h2 id="hypergrowth-einstein-works-3-jobs">Hypergrowth = Einstein Works 3 Jobs</h2><p>Hypergrowth is a great concept, intellectually. But, if it is force fed to a society, it kills innovation. Because in these economies, Einstein does not work at a Patent Office. He works 3 jobs to pay his debts, and never has a moment to think about "light, energy and matter".</p><p>Other than large scale internet companies helping us take selfies, we haven't innovated much. The situation is so bad that it takes a crazy right wing billionaire (another one of my heroes) to build a battery powered car mainstream. Ford built his MVP in a f****ing garage.</p><h3 id="a-world-without-winner-take-all-markets">A World Without Winner Take All Markets</h3><p>There isn't a quick fix solution to this. But if fixed, here's what the world would look like.</p><p>There would be 10-15 Facebooks, for different niches. Most subreddits would be dedicated communities, and companies, of their own. Most markets won't be winner take all. There will be way way way more entrepreneurs than today - mostly small, and mostly "businesspeople" not innovative. Lesser debt, more healthcare. Less stress, more time. Less "me too" disruption, more real innovation. &nbsp;Less noise, more signal. But also, way lesser companies for VCs to invest in, way lesser organised Funds, way lesser ways for rich people to invest in and make even more money.</p><p>Consequently, many smart people will fill these gaps, start new funds. Invest in "me too disruptive" companies. And in a few decades, the world will be back to "let's grow fast".</p><p>But in those decades, Einstein would happen, again.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

      <h2>Why I joined Coiled</h2>
      
      <h5><i>by Hugo Bowne-Anderson</i></h5>

    <div>
      <p>I recently joined <a href="https://coiled.io/">Coiled</a> as Head of Data Science Evangelism and Marketing. In this post, I’ll tell you why.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-me">A bit about me</h2>

<p><em>I am restlessly interested in promoting data literacy, broadening access to computation, and lowering barriers to data tooling.</em></p>

<p>To understand why I joined Coiled, a company that builds products and provides support for data scientists and teams working in Python with data at scale, it’s worth providing some context on who I am, where I’ve been, and what I do. Most recently, I worked at DataCamp, an EdTech company whose mission is to democratize data science education. An early employee there, I built out the foundational Python data science curriculum and wore other hats in marketing, product, data science and analytics, evangelism, and professional services. Prior to this, I worked in academic research (cell biology, applied mathematics, biophysics) at Yale University and the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, where I also taught workshops on Practical Data Science for Researchers. I am restlessly interested in promoting both data and computational literacy, reducing “computational anxiety,” lowering barriers to data tooling, and increasing both the adoption and development of open-source software (OSS).</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-coiled">A bit about Coiled</h2>

<p>Coiled is a company born from the open-source ecosystem to meet the increasing needs of teams, organizations, and the enterprise to use OSS. For data scientists, analysts, and engineers using Python at scale, the package <a href="https://coiled.io/blog/dask.org/">Dask</a> (which “provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at scale for the tools you love”) is an attractive option but doesn’t meet the growing needs of teams and the enterprise. <a href="https://coiled.io/blog/hello-world.html">This is why we founded Coiled earlier this year</a>: to build products to meet those pressing needs.</p>

<p>So, then, why did I join Coiled? To answer this, I think it’s key to answer a set of sub-questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why a company based around open-source software?</li>
  <li>Why a Python company?</li>
  <li>Why a seed stage startup?</li>
  <li>Why evangelism and marketing?</li>
  <li>Why Coiled?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-a-company-based-around-open-source-software">Why a company based around open-source software?</h2>
<p><em>I’m excited to play a part in the next level of OSS adoption around the world, both in academic research and industry.</em></p>
<p>
<img src="https://coiled.io/images/black-hole-katie-bouman.jpg" width="50%">
</p>
<p> <span size="-1">Dr Katie Bouman with the Event Horizon Telescope  <br> team's first ever image of a black hole, the creation  of <br> which  used the OSS PyData stack (look closely, it's matplotlib!) </span> </p>

<p>It is unquestionable that open-source software and tooling have changed the nature of business, academic research, and data science. I came of age in academic research at a time when there was a serious shift in moving away from proprietary software, such as MATLAB and Mathematica, to tools such as Python and R. The collaborative, open, and transparent nature of OSS, when done correctly, results in software that meets individual end-user needs and software that evolves as these needs evolve. As Eric Raymond notes in his seminal essay <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” This OSS mantra was named Linus’ Law in honor of Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. The eponymous “Cathedral” refers to software with development cycles restricted to exclusive groups and  “Bazaar” to software developed in public view. Moreover, as <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-p%C3%A9rez">Fernando Perez</a>, creator of IPython and co-lead of Project Jupyter, stated in his keynote at the inaugural JupyterCon,</p>

<p><em>If science is about opening up the black box of nature, we shouldn’t be doing science with tools that we are not legally allowed to open up and understand.</em></p>

<p>It was the burgeoning impact of the open-source on data work of all kinds that led me to join DataCamp in early 2016 to build out their foundational and scalable Pythonic data science curriculum.</p>

<p>There are at least two related challenges in the OSS space:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The need for sustainable sources of funding for open-source software development;</li>
  <li>OSS meets the needs of individual end users, but cannot always meet those of teams, organization, and the enterprise.</li>
</ol>

<p>With respect to the second point, it’s key to note that, as <a href="https://physics.calpoly.edu/bgranger">Brian Granger</a>, co-lead of Project Jupyter, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/project-jupyter-interactive-computing">has stated</a>,</p>

<p><em>Open-source software is undergoing a phase transition from having individual users in organizations to having large scale institutional adoption.</em></p>

<p>Here are some examples across several verticals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a>’s discovery of gravitational waves in 2016 used <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/">many OSS tools from the PyData ecosystem</a>;</li>
  <li>JP Morgan’s trading platform Athena contains <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/jpmorgans-athena-has-35-million-lines-of-python-code-and-wont-be-updated-to-python-3-in-time/">35 million lines of Python code</a>;</li>
  <li>Walmart uses Python, Dask, and XGBoost (a popular machine learning framework) to “<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/07/11/walmart-nvidia/">tear through their massive-scale data analytics and machine learning</a>”;</li>
  <li>Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233">runs over 150,000 batch Jupyter notebook jobs a day</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/r-tensorflow-api/">T-Mobile uses R and TensorFlow</a> to deploy machine learning models with the aim of  building conversational AI to improve the customer experience;</li>
  <li>The Event Horizon Telescope team used the OSS PyData stack <a href="https://numfocus.org/case-studies/first-photograph-black-hole">to create the first ever image of a black hole</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>However, OSS is not always organization or enterprise ready, nor should it be. In the gap between OSS and the enterprise, we find the need for companies such as Coiled. This is why <a href="https://coiled.io/blog/founding.html">we built it</a>: to help Dask meet the needs of modern teams doing data science at scale. These needs include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data analysts, scientists, and engineers being able to have one-click hosted cloud deployments and seamless integration between their local workstation configurations and their at-scale data work on cloud clusters;</li>
  <li>Data team leads having insight into data infrastructure usage and spend across their team and the larger organization;</li>
  <li>IT requirements for security and authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without companies that build products and provide support for organizations to use OSS, there will simply be less adoption of OSS. I joined Coiled because I’m excited to play a part in the next level of OSS adoption around the world, both in academic research and industry.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-python-company">Why a Python company?</h2>
<p><em>Data Science, impact, and community.</em></p>

<p>The reasons for joining a company in the Python ecosystem are simple: data scientist needs, impact, and community. Dave Robinson’s 2017 post <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/"><em>The Incredible Growth of Python</em></a> made it clear, if it wasn’t before, that Python was growing… well… in an incredible fashion… and it still is (you can play around with <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends">Stack Overflow Trends</a> to see this yourself). There is simply a huge amount of demand for companies built around the PyData stack and, as a Pythonista, I’m in a position where I hope to have impact by meeting those needs, which I predict will only increase over the coming years.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://coiled.io/images/stack-python-growth.png" width="75%">
</p>


<p>The other reason for joining a Pythonic company is the PyData community, many of whom I’ve enjoyed working with over the years and many of whom I consider friends and mentors. In many ways, the PyData community feels like family and gives me a sense of a home away from home. PyData conferences are some of my favorite conferences to go to, as is SciPy (and there’s also something about Austin in the summertime!). Anybody who tuned in to DataFramed, the DataCamp podcast I hosted, would have noticed a recurring emphasis on the PyData community and its impact (among other patterns, of course), including early interviews with <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-science-astronomy">Jake VanderPlas</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-science-nuclear-engineering">Katy Huff</a>, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-security-privacy-gdpr">conversations</a> with <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/Data-Privacy-Age-of-COVID-19">Katharine Jarmul</a>, and interviews with PyData tool creators and builders <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-science-tool-building">Wes McKinney</a> (pandas), <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/credibility-crisis-in-data-science">Skipper Seabold</a> (statsmodels), and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/project-jupyter-interactive-computing">Brian Granger</a> (Project Jupyter). It is also worth mentioning how important academic research and educational communities, where I feel at home due to my research background, have been to the PyData stack, which has largely grown out of academia in the past (there is now much more diverse organizational coverage).</p>

<h2 id="why-a-seed-stage-startup">Why a seed stage startup?</h2>
<p><em>Leadership, learning, and a bias for getting things done.</em></p>

<p>There are 2 major reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I love the hustle and bustle, the do-what-needs-to-be-done, the problem-solving, and bias-for-action that’s required at smaller companies, and the necessary learning that then occurs;</li>
  <li>I am excited to be end-responsible for a business function and look forward to growing into a leadership position as we scale Coiled.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are so many examples of early-stage startup problem-solving and bias-for-action that I love but one stands out:</p>

<p><em>When I started at DataCamp, my mandate was to build out as many high quality Pythonic data science courses as possible. Company leadership told me that collaborations with RStudio had been successful on the R curriculum side and asked me who the RStudio of PythonLand was. I told them it was Continuum Analytics, now Anaconda Inc., although there were key distinctions between them. We had breakfast early one morning with Peter Wang, then CTO of Continuum, in Cambridge, MA. Peter seemed to really dig the product and introduced us to Travis Oliphant, then CEO of Continuum. We had some great calls with Travis but, in order to get 4+ courses on the roadmap with Continuum, we needed to get in the same room. So one Friday afternoon in mid-June of 2016, I called my CEO and said, “why don’t we just fly to Austin on Sunday and pop into the Continuum office on Monday to say hi?” He loved the idea but rightly suggested that I email Travis to let him know we were planning to visit. Travis replied generously, as always, that he’d be happy to see us but he may not have a lot of time as it was his birthday! En route to the Continuum office on West 6th St in downtown Austin, I decided to swing by a great hot sauce shop (with the great name <a href="https://www.tearsofjoysauces.com/">Tears of Joy</a>) and bought Travis a birthday hamper of hot sauces and salsas. Travis spent hours with us that day, talking shop, both business and technical, and took us to an early dinner before joining his family for his own birthday dinner. Two days later, as we were in a taxi heading for Austin Bergstrom Airport, we received a signed contract from Travis for our first 4 collaborative courses …</em></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Nearly two dozen African nations are now committed to build and maintain the “Great Green Wall,” a chain of forests and woodlands spreading across the entire continent at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, in the region known as the Sahel. Initially launched in 2007 by 11 countries, the initiative has now been joined by ten more. It is considered the world’s largest ecosystem restoration project by the <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/worlds-biggest-ecosystem-restoration-project" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">UN Environment Programme<span></span></a>.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The project aims to address many of the continent’s core challenges at once. Most directly, it provides a physical barrier to ward off the spread of the Sahara. The Sahara has been moving gradually south for millennia, encroaching on and disrupting local livelihoods. However <a href="https://kindling.xyz/tag/climate-change/" data-wpel-link="internal">climate change</a> has accelerated this process, creating a major economic and environmental threat to the nations of the Sahel, many of which are already among the world’s poorest and least developed. </p>
<figure><img src="https://797230.smushcdn.com/1547441/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Least-Developed-Nations.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1" alt="" srcset="https://797230.smushcdn.com/1547441/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Least-Developed-Nations-150x84.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 150w, https://797230.smushcdn.com/1547441/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Least-Developed-Nations.jpg?size=234x132&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 234w, https://797230.smushcdn.com/1547441/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Least-Developed-Nations.jpg?size=468x263&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 468w, https://797230.smushcdn.com/1547441/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Least-Developed-Nations.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/to-prosper-poorest-countries-need-avenues-to-electricity/a-41472049" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">DW<span></span></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wall will reclaim 247 million acres of land by the year 2030, which can then be used for more economically productive purposes like agriculture and livestock. More trees will result in more rainfall being diverted back into the land, and therefore more water available to communities and ecosystems. The new trees will capture around <a href="https://time.com/5669033/great-green-wall-africa/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">250 million metric tons of carbon ever year<span></span></a>, roughly equivalent to removing all of California’s cars from the road for more than three year. The process of planting and maintaining the wall will also create hundreds of thousands of jobs over the course of the next several years.</p>
<p>It’s a win-win-win-win!</p>
<p>The effort is estimated to cost $8 billion USD and be completed by 2030. It is currently about 15% complete.</p>
<p>I love projects like these. They just make so much sense. They provide incredible economic bang for their buck, ensuring the <a href="https://kindling.xyz/tag/sustainability/" data-wpel-link="internal">sustainability</a> of livelihoods for decades, while also employing people in the process and offering a critical solution to the <a href="https://kindling.xyz/tag/climate-crisis/" data-wpel-link="internal">climate crisis</a>. But more than that, they demonstrate the importance and viability of international cooperation at a time when nearly all of humanity’s deepest challenges are trans-boundary, requiring us to collaborate with one another, even to re-envision ourselves as all part of the same team.</p>
<p>What other major development projects might we be able to make a reality if more countries acknowledged their shared challenges and pooled their resources together toward a common goal?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The language of mathematics is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity. As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p> <p><span><a href="#" target="_self"><span><strong>Download the 4-Page Higher Mathematical Jargon Mindmap</strong></span></a></span></p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png 1130w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-600x308.png 600w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-768x395.png 768w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-1024x526.png 1024w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" title="Math Glossary Header Image" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201366%20702'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png 1130w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-600x308.png 600w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-768x395.png 768w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-1024x526.png 1024w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-300x154.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png"></p><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>This post is spurred by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597805394/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1597805394&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hiddevaria-20&amp;linkId=2AWNAXTWHGOHWXWS"><cite>Permutation City</cite></a>, which is excellently thought-provoking. <a href="http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/">Greg Egan</a> is now one of my favorite authors.</em></p>

<h2 id="thought-experiments">Thought Experiments</h2>

<p>I hold no dualist notions, and do not find philosophical zombies very convincing either. As such, I am fully prepared to believe that if you were to create a sufficiently-detailed simulation of my brain, and run it inside a sufficiently-powerful computer, it would experience consciousness. There are certainly short- and medium-term practical obstacles to this, in terms of our poor understanding of what is necessary for a sufficiently-detailed brain simulation. But I see no reason this wouldn’t be possible eventually.</p>

<p>Let’s consider what this simulation really is: a program, which generates a series of (very long) numbers. Each number represents the state of the computer’s memory at that point in the simulation. Let’s take the sequence of numbers representing ten simulated minutes of brain time. As the machine’s memory evolves according to these numbers throughout ten minutes, we have a simulacrum of me experiencing consciousness.</p>

<p>What would happen if we evolved the computer’s memory a bit more slowly? Say, instead of holding these numbers in memory at their original rate, we took twice as long—twenty minutes. What does the simulacrum-me experience? Obviously, it still experiences ten minutes of consciousness; it has no frame of reference that tells it that “out there” twenty minutes have passed.</p>

<p>Let’s try something else. What if we got rid of the program simulating the brain, and simply replaced it with a dumb program that read the ten-minutes-of-numbers off disk and loaded them into memory, in sequence. This should be functionally identical; it doesn’t matter whether the memory was computed ahead of time or in real time. The system will still have a conscious experience. It can’t tell whether those numbers came from the CPU or the hard disk.</p>

<p>What if I, the physical human, wrote down all those numbers on pieces of paper in sequence? Does that written-on paper now experience consciousness? It seems like it should; there’s nothing magical about transistors. Remember, no dualism allowed.</p>

<p>Does it make a difference how good my handwriting is?</p>

<p>What if I only wrote down the first such number? Assuming a deterministic universe, there is a set of rules that will evolve that single number forward in time, to live a full life (even beyond the ten minutes we originally ran the computer program for). Maybe I’d need to write down some encoding of those deterministic rules, too—although I’m not sure why. Does that single written-down number experience consciousness?</p>

<p>What if we never involved computers, computer memory, or paper at all? The number still exists, even without me writing it down, as do the rules for evolving it. (Even without humans around to count, the number five still exists.) Does … something … still experience consciousness?</p>

<h2 id="thought-conclusions">Thought Conclusions</h2>

<p>I imagine there are two reactions to this. Perhaps the more common will be to assume I’m performing a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> on the idea of simulating conscious experience. I started from that premise, and came to the conclusion that my (simulated?) consciousness exists and experiences things independent of any physical substrate. Seems absurd, so something must have gone wrong, right?</p>

<p>I don’t think so. Not only is the chain of logic inescapable, but this line of thinking also points toward a sublime solution to some of the biggest questions around. Namely, why does anything exist at all? And, why is mathematics so spectacularly effective at describing the physical universe?</p>

<p>The answer is that the universe itself is simply a timeless mathematical construct. Of what type, we’re not exactly sure yet; it’s looking like it’ll be some kind of mashup of a 3+1-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold with tensor fields obeying certain partial differential equations, plus operator-valued fields on ℝ<sup>4</sup> with certain commutation relations acting on an abstract Hilbert space. But when we do have our theory of everything, plus the initial conditions of the universe, it’s clear to me that within its Platonic mathematical structure lies all of the manifest complexity and consciousness we observe around us.</p>

<p>There’s no need to run a simulation. The mathematical structure exists, independent of human discovery, or of computers to run it. And that’s why you and I exist.</p>

						<blockquote><p>
Human history has an unfortunate record of discrimination and biases against each other that follow us from ancient times. A conscious effort towards developing inclusive and equal social systems is a necessity. In the increasingly automated world, where computers interact with humans, Artificial Intelligence gives us another shot at making the world a fairer place with equal opportunities.</p>
<p>However, machines are built by people. We are obliged to put conscious effort into making sure the AI solutions won’t carry over our mistakes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The appeal of AI is tremendous: it can search through millions of pieces of data and use it to make forecasts that are often more accurate than ours. Automating processes with AI also seems more objective than relying on subjective (and slower) human analysis. After all, the AI  algorithm will not “dislike” your picture or assume anything based on it, especially when it is taught to ignore it completely.</p>
<p>The problem is, AI algorithms are not necessarily human-bias free. AI is designed and trained on human data, and human thinking is characterized by bias. Therefore bias is also a built-in byproduct of human-designed systems. These AI biases can echo problematic perceptions, such as the perceived superiority of certain groups. Even well-designed AI systems can still end up with a bias, entirely by accident.</p>
<p>The question is: can we prevent AI from being racist and sexist? And if we can, then could machines help us create a fairer society?</p>

<h2> People and biases </h2>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning: before the machines were biased, people were. Why is that? According to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionary</a>, bias is <em>“the action of supporting or opposing a particular person or thing in an unfair way, because of allowing personal opinions to influence your judgment.”</em></p>
<p>Biases can be innate or learned. People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief. It does not have to be limited to ethnicity and race; it is also gender, religion, sexual orientation, and many other characteristics that are subject to bias. </p>
<h3>Are all biases conscious?</h3>
<p>There are two types of bias: conscious (also known as explicit bias) and unconscious (also known as implicit bias). The <a href="http://perception.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Transforming-Perception.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conscious bias</a> refers to the attitude we have on a conscious level, and most of the time, it arises as to the direct result of a perceived threat.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://diversity.ucsf.edu/resources/unconscious-bias#:~:text=Unconscious%20bias%20is%20far%20more,or%20working%20under%20time%20pressure." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unconscious bias</a> is a social stereotype about certain groups of people that a person form outside their conscious awareness. It is automatic, unintentional, deeply ingrained, and able to influence behavior. Unconscious bias is more prevalent than the conscious one. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/understanding-biases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Psychological Association</a>, <b>only a small proportion of Americans today are explicitly racist</b> and feel hatred towards other ethnicities and races.</p>
<p>But the majority of Americans, because they have grown up in a culture that has been historically racist in many ways and because they’re exposed to the media that are biased, associate violence, drugs, and poverty with specific groups. </p>

<p>People will always be biased to some extent because their opinions are subjective and what is worse – humans tend to generalize. This is partly the fault of the way we are programmed, and partly the failure of the way we programmed our society and culture. Does it mean machines have to be programmed like this as well? </p>

<p>Obviously, AI solutions have no political agenda of their own, right? It’s not going to be intentionally racist unless it has <em>explicitly</em> been trained to be. It is also not (most of the time, at least) a political agenda of their creators that is the issue. The problem is that it is very easy to train machines to be racist by accident and without even trying. </p>
<p>Here are a few examples of how algorithms can discriminate on different fields based on race: </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Image Recognition: </strong> Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology tested eight image-recognition systems used in self-driving cars, after observing higher error rates for specific demographics. They <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/self-driving-car-crash-racial-bias-black-people-study-a8810031.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found their accuracy proving five percent less accurate</a> on average for people with darker skin. So a self-driving car is more likely to run over a black person than it is to run a white one. </li>
<li> <strong> Healthcare: </strong> An algorithm used in US hospitals to allocate healthcare for patients has been systematically discriminating against black people. A study concluded that the algorithm was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6#ref-CR1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less likely to refer black people than white people</a> who were equally sick to programs that aim to improve care for patients with complex medical needs. </li>

<li> <strong> Criminal Cases: </strong> In 2016, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProPublica published</a> an investigation on an ML program that is used by courts to predict future criminals, and they found out that the system is biased against black people. The program learned about who is mostly to end up in jail from incarceration data. And historically, the criminal justice system has been unfair to black Americans. So when an AI program was fed with these historical data, it learned from biased decisions historically made by humans. </li>
<li> <strong> Natural Language Processing (<a href="https://sigmoidal.io/boosting-your-solutions-with-nlp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NLP</a>): </strong> There is a broad spectrum of cases (for example, work/college admissions or even loan applications), where words can serve as an input – the so-called <em>word embeddings</em> represent words as inputs to machine learning. But there is a fairness problem when an algorithm learns the meaning of words from humans. Our opinions are often subjective and biased, so the meaning of the words (e.g., people names) is then biased. A <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> paper in Science from 2017</a> found out that when a computer teaches itself English by crawling the internet, it becomes prejudiced against black Americans and women. For example, when <a href="http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GloVe news dataset is used</a>, the sentiment (how positive a given sentence is) of simple text starting with ‘My name is…’ is significantly lower when it ends with common names of black people than common names for white people.

<h2> How can we fight it? </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bias-free AI can soon be a powerful tool to tackle social issues – such as enhancing social mobility through fairer access to the financing/healthcare system, mitigating exclusion and poverty through making the judiciary systems more objective, bias-free testing in university admissions, and much more. We should expect fair AI solutions from both technology companies and authorities.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Military and tactics books say that weapons or tactics should always take into consideration the enemy strategy. That is also true for this particular fairness and human dignity fight. In the case of this war, there are also different ways to fight racial bias, depending on the domain (field) and the data used by the algorithm. </p>
<h3> Image Recognition </h3>
<p>In the case of image-recognition systems, the reason for bias is that training data that machines use for learning contain mostly samples gathered from white people. These AI solutions can have problems with recognizing people of different races because it simply did not see enough pictures of them. The effect is doubled when it comes to women of color.</p>
<p>Face recognition systems from the leading companies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxuyfWoVV98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed during the man/women classification</a> of Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams. </p>
<p>The biggest problem here is that face-recognition systems are widely used by law enforcement and border control. If the application has high false-positive rates for a specific group (and according to <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> NIST study</a>, a majority of the face recognition algorithms used in the US had worse perform on nonwhite faces), it puts this population at the highest risk for being falsely accused of a crime. </p>

<p>The solution (our weapon) for this problem is quite simple. Still, it requires more attention during dataset preparation: the equal representation of people of color and gender in training datasets (e.g., face recognition) is crucial for algorithms (like face recognition ones) to work with the same precision regardless of race or gender.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the sociological point of view, those bias problems would be hard to overlook and natural to point out if minority representatives would be more encouraged to be a part of the artificial intelligence team.</p>
<h3> Biases in AI solutions for Healthcare </h3>
<p>The reason millions of black people were affected by racial bias in health-care algorithms? It was based on the historical cost of health care, where higher health-care costs are associated with greater needs. People who did have higher-cost treatment were assumed to need more extensive care, which seemed just about right – or did it?</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this approach was the fact that those less wealthy simply couldn’t afford more extensive treatment, so they chose less expensive options, while their actual needs remain the same as people in the same condition who could opt in the more expensive ones.</p>
<p>The approximation of the healthcare needs by the amount of money spent on treatment was actually an exclusive approach, biased towards more wealthy people.

<h3><em>UNIGE scientists have fine-tuned a neuro-computer model, combining neuronal oscillations and predictive coding, which helps explain how the brain identifies syllables in natural speech.</em></h3>
<h3><img src="https://www.unige.ch/communication/communiques/files/3215/9309/0085/Ondes750x329.jpg" alt="Ondes750x329.jpg" width="750" height="329"></h3>
<p><em>@ DR</em></p>
<div><p><strong>The brain analyses spoken language by recognising syllables. Scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Evolving Language National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR) have designed a computational model that reproduces the complex mechanism employed by the central nervous system to perform this operation. The model, which brings together two independent theoretical frameworks, uses the equivalent of neuronal oscillations produced by brain activity to process the continuous sound flow of connected speech. The model functions according to a theory known as predictive coding, whereby the brain optimizes perception by constantly trying to predict the sensory signals based on candidate hypotheses (syllables in this model). The resulting model, described in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>, has helped the live recognition of thousands of syllables contained in hundreds of sentences spoken in natural language. This has validated the idea that neuronal oscillations can be used to coordinate the flow of syllables we hear with the predictions made by our brain.</strong></p><p>“Brain activity produces neuronal oscillations that can be measured using electroencephalography,” begins Anne-Lise Giraud, professor in the Department of Basic Neurosciences in UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and co-director of the Evolving Language NCCR. These are electromagnetic waves that result from the coherent electrical activity of entire networks of neurons. There are several types, defined according to their frequency. They are called alpha, beta, theta, delta or gamma waves. Taken individually or superimposed, these rhythms are linked to different cognitive functions, such as perception, memory, attention, alertness, etc. <br>However, neuroscientists do not yet know whether they actively contribute to these functions and how. In an earlier study published in 2015, Professor Giraud’s team showed that the theta waves (low frequency) and gamma waves (high frequency) coordinate to sequence the sound flow in syllables and to analyse their content so they can be recognised.<br>The Geneva-based scientists developed a spiking neural network computer model based on these physiological rhythms, whose performance in sequencing live (on-line) syllables was better than that of traditional automatic speech recognition systems.</p></div>
<p><strong>The rhythm of the syllables</strong><br>In their first model, the theta waves (between 4 and 8 Hertz) made it possible to follow the rhythm of the syllables as they were perceived by the system. Gamma waves (around 30 Hertz) were used to segment the auditory signal into smaller slices and encode them. This produces a “phonemic” profile linked to each sound sequence, which could be compared, a posteriori, to a library of known syllables. One of the advantages of this type of model is that it spontaneously adapts to the speed of speech, which can vary from one individual to another.</p>
<p><strong>Predictive coding</strong><br>In this new article, to stay closer to the biological reality, Professor Giraud and her team developed a new model where they incorporate elements from another theoretical framework, independent of the neuronal oscillations: “predictive coding”. “This theory holds that the brain functions so optimally because it is constantly trying to anticipate and explain what is happening in the environment by using learned models of how outside events generate sensory signals. In the case of spoken language, it attempts to find the most likely causes of the sounds perceived by the ear as speech unfolds, on the basis of a set of mental representations that have been learned and that are being permanently updated.”, says Dr. Itsaso Olasagasti, computational neuroscientist in Giraud’s team, who supervised the new model implementation.<br>“We developed a computer model that simulates this predictive coding,” explains Sevada Hovsepyan, a researcher in the Department of Basic Neurosciences and the article’s first author. “And we implemented it by incorporating oscillatory mechanisms.”</p>
<p><strong>Tested on 2,888 syllables</strong><br>The sound entering the system is first modulated by a theta (slow) wave that resembles what neuron populations produce. It makes it possible to signal the contours of the syllables. Trains of (fast) gamma waves then help encode the syllable as and when it is perceived. During the process, the system suggests possible syllables and corrects the choice if necessary. After going back and forth between the two levels several times, it discovers the right syllable. The system is subsequently reset to zero at the end of each perceived syllable.<br>The model has been successfully tested using 2,888 different syllables contained in 220 sentences, spoken in natural language in English. “On the one hand, we succeeded in bringing together two very different theoretical frameworks in a single computer model,” explains Professor Giraud. “On the other, we have shown that neuronal oscillations most likely rhythmically align the endogenous functioning of the brain with signals that come from outside via the sensory organs. If we put this back in predictive coding theory, it means that these oscillations probably allow the brain to make the right hypothesis at exactly the right moment.”</p>

    <p>A bit more than four years ago I started the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">xi-editor</a> project. Now I have placed it on the back burner (though there is still some activity from the open source community).</p>

<p>The original goal was to deliver a very high quality editing experience. To this end, the project spent a rather large number of “novelty points”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rust as the implementation language for the core.</li>
  <li>A rope data structure for text storage.</li>
  <li>A multiprocess architecture, with front-end and plug-ins each with their own process.</li>
  <li>Fully embracing async design.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> as a mechanism for concurrent modification.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I <em>also</em> believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary.</p>

<p>I’ve written the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">CRDT part of this retrospective</a> already, as a comment in response to a Github issue. That prompted good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">discussion</a> on Hacker News. In this post, I will touch again on CRDT but will focus on the other aspects of the system design.</p>

<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>

<p>The original motivation for xi came from working on the Android text stack, and confronting two problems in particular. One, text editing would become very slow as the text buffer got bigger. Two, there were a number of concurrency bugs in the interface between the EditText widget and the keyboard (input method editor).</p>

<p>The culprit of the first problem turned out to be the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/SpanWatcher">SpanWatcher</a> interface, combined with the fact that modern keyboards like to put a spelling correction span on each word. When you insert a character, all the successive spans bump their locations up by one, and then you have to send onSpanChanged for each of those spans to all the watchers. Combined with the fact that the spans data structure had a naive O(n) implementation, and the whole thing was quadratic or worse.</p>

<p>The concurrency bugs boil down to synchronizing edits across two different processes, because the keyboard is a different process than the application hosting the EditText widget. Thus, when you send an update (to move the cursor, for example) and the text on the other side is changing concurrently, it’s ambiguous whether it refers to the old or new location. This was handled in an “almost correct” style, with timeouts for housekeeping updates to minimize the chance of a race. A nice manifestation of that is that swiping the cursor slowly through text containing complex emoji could cause flashes of the emoji breaking.</p>

<p>These problems have a unifying thread: in both cases there are small diffs to the text, but then the data structures and protocols handled these diffs in a less than optimal way, leading to both performance and correctness bugs.</p>

<p>To a large extent, xi started as an exploration into the “right way” to handle text editing operations. In the case of the concurrency bugs, I was hoping to find a general, powerful technique to facilitate concurrent text editing in a distributed-ish system. While most of the Operational Transformation literature is focused on multiple users collaboratively editing a document, I was hoping that other text manipulations (like an application enforcing credit card formatting on a text input field) could fit into the general framework.</p>

<p>That was also the time I was starting to get heavily into Rust, so it made natural sense to start prototyping a new green-field text editing engine. How would you “solve text” if you were free of backwards compatibility constraints (a huge problem in Android)?</p>

<p>When I started, I knew that Operational Transformation was a solution for collaborative editing, but had a reputation for being complex and finicky. I had no idea how deep the rabbithole would be of OT and then CRDT. Much of that story is told in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">CRDT discussion</a> previously linked.</p>

<h2 id="the-lure-of-modular-software">The lure of modular software</h2>

<p>There is an extremely long history of people trying to build software as composable modules connected by some kind of inter-module communication fabric. Historical examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC">DCE/RPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture">Corba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(GNOME)">Bonobo</a>, and more recently things like <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm</a> and <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/modular/module">Fuchsia Modular</a>. There are some partial successes, including <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder">Binder</a> on Android, but this is still mostly an unrealized vision. (Regarding Binder, it evolved from a much more idealistic vision, and I strongly recommend reading this 2006 interview about <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/13674/introduction-to-openbinder-and-interview-with-dianne-hackborn/">OpenBinder</a>).</p>

<p>When I started xi, there were signs we were getting there. Microservices were becoming popular in the Internet world, and of course all Web apps have a client/server boundary. Within Google, <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> was working fairly well, as was the internal process separation within Chrome. In Unix land, there’s a long history of the terminal itself presenting a GUI (if primitive, though gaining features such as color and mouse). There’s also the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and then, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> and X11.</p>

<p>I think one of the strongest positive models was the database / business logic split, which is arguably the most successful example of process separation. In this model, the database is responsible for performance and integrity, and the business logic is in a separate process, so it can safely do things like crash and hang. I very much thought of xi-core as a database-like engine, capable of handling concurrent text modification much like a database handles transactions.</p>

<p>Building software in such a modular way requires two things: first, infrastructure to support remote procedure calls (including serialization of the requests and data), and second, well-defined interfaces. Towards the end of 2017, I saw the goal of xi-editor as <em>primarily</em> being about defining the interfaces needed for large scale text editing, and that this work could endure over a long period of time even as details of the implementation changed.</p>

<p>For the infrastructure, we chose JSON (about which more below) and hand-rolled our own xi-rpc layer (based on JSON-RPC). It turns out there are a lot of details to get right, including dealing with error conditions, negotiating when two ends of the protocol aren’t exactly on the same version, etc.</p>

<p>One of the bolder design decisions in xi was to have a process separation between front-end and core. This was inspired in part by <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, in which everything is a plugin, even GUI. But the main motivation was to build GUI applications using Rust, even though at the time Rust was nowhere near capable of native GUI. The idea is that you use the best GUI technology of the platform, and communicate via async pipes.</p>

<p>One argument for process separation is to improve overall system reliability. For example, Chrome has a process per tab, and if the process crashes, all you get is an “Aw, snap” without bringing the whole browser down. I think it’s worth asking the question: is it useful to have the front-end continue after the core crashes, or the other way around? I think probably not; in the latter case it might be able to safely save the file, but you can also do that by frequently checkpointing.</p>

<p>Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing goals related to project management, not technical excellence. Ideally, once you’ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes down. I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects. And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big companies tend to have more resources.</p>

<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>

<p>The choice of JSON was controversial from the start. It did end up being a source of friction, but for surprising reasons.</p>

<p>The original vision was to write plug-ins in any language, especially for things like language servers that would be best developed in the language of that ecosystem. This is the main reason I chose JSON, because I expected there would be high quality implementations in every viable language.</p>

<p>Many people complained about the fact that JSON escapes strings, and suggested alternatives such as <a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html">MessagePack</a>. But I knew that the speed of raw JSON parsing was a solved problem, with a number of extremely high performance implementations (<a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is a good example).</p>

<p>Even so, aside from the general problems of modular software as described above, JSON was the source of two additional problems. For one, <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-mac/issues/102">JSON in Swift is shockingly slow</a>. There are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/rearchitecting-jsonencoder-to-be-much-faster/28139">discussions on improving it</a> but it’s still a problem. This is surprising to me considering how important it is in many workloads, and the fact that it’s clearly possible to write a high performance JSON implementation.</p>

<p>Second, on the Rust side, while <a href="https://serde.rs/">serde</a> is quite fast and very convenient (thanks to proc macros), when serializing a large number of complex structures, it bloats code size considerably. The xi core is 9.3 megabytes in a Linux release build (debug is an eye-watering 88MB), and a great deal of that bloat is serialization. There is work to reduce this, including <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/miniserde">miniserde</a> and <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde">nanoserde</a>, but serde is still by far the most mainstream.</p>

<p>I believe it’s possible to do performant, clean JSON across most languages, but people should know, we’re not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-rope">The rope</h2>

<p>There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope. I would consider the first unsuitable for the goals of xi-editor as it doesn’t scale well to large documents, though its simplicity is appealing, and memcpy is fast these days; if you know your document is always under a megabyte or so, it’s probably the best choice.</p>

<p>Array of lines has performance failure modes, most notably very long lines. Similarly, many good editors have been written using piece tables, but I’m not a huge fan; performance is very good when first opening the file, but degrades over time.</p>

<p>My favorite aspect of the rope as a data structure is its excellent …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Hey bru! I’ve launched 2 apps in the past month which both use the algorithm I’ll discuss today. It’s a line smoothing algorithm which I think is applicable for a variety of applications.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll discuss the algorithm itself and how I implemented it in Flutter.</p>

<p>Just just getting started with Flutter? <a href="https://kangabru.xyz/2020/05/15/zero-to-hero-1.html">Check out my first post here</a>. Also try out my games below to see the algorithm in action!</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="show-me-the-icing">Show me the icing</h2>

<video loop="" controls="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/704713b752c561b7f557824b1f6a7e7fee5d6aef/86f03/images/posts/2020-06-26/icing.mp4"></video>

<p>Check out the video to see my algorithm in action.</p>

<p>A couple things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The icing is buttery smooth. You can draw as rough as you like but the result is a super smooth line</li>
  <li>The icing motion feels a bit ‘sticky’. It feels somewhat like real icing and makes the game more challenging and skilful.</li>
</ul>



<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c50e733faa4c0d77cef80e43df6ad5d73ffa058a/db698/images/posts/2020-06-26/snek.png"></p>

<p>I also use the algorithm for my snake inspired game Squiggle Snek. It allows me to draw the snake body nice and smooth.</p>

<p>But this is just what I use it for, it has potential for many more uses. In fact I’ve seen similar concepts used by Adobe and various apps/websites around the place.</p>

<p>Enough talk, let’s see how it works!</p>

<h2 id="starting-small">Starting small</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ab5bf7f2de9f69e40b7cd28118671600625a26f6/3976d/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_1.jpg"></p>

<p>Imagine you have 3 points in a line like this. How would you go about smoothing it?</p>

<p>My approach was to try average the lines together to flatten the peak. In this case the middle peak is pulled towards the centre of the two connected points at the bottom like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fe42c623143f4421ed5ad03c473aed7058d2e1d9/8b12e/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_2.jpg"></p>

<p>You can see this is done easily by averaging the positions of the bottom points, then averaging <em>that</em> position with the top point.</p>

<p>What would it look like on a longer line?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/44cdf6a2b74eae933f5f63ba0ab56d43ef5de670/a3691/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_3.jpg"></p>

<p>The process is the same, we just have to do it for each point down the line.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/72180015b1b1c5046a9803c7ba8da621cb13d7b2/337f9/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_4.jpg"></p>

<p>Sweet, it actually smoothed out! Notice that each point is in the middle of it’s adjacent points.</p>

<p>So far so good but we’re not using many points yet. We need to scale it up.</p>

<h2 id="lets-go-bigger">Let’s go bigger</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to smooth a line, how does it work in the real world?</p>

<p>When you draw a line you get <em>thousands</em> of points that are very close together - often just pixels apart. How would our algorithm perform in this case? Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/977d66d24bce0f64b73f85c8115fc44909f868bd/b0491/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_7.jpg"></p>

<p>Pretty nice right? But there are just a few problem areas which I’ve marked with arrows.</p>

<p>Firstly it’s highly dependant on the distance between points. Smaller gaps will result in less smoothing. Larger gaps will result in <em>over</em> smoothing. Take this example:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/77ed07e4402adfe56cc478289b7bba56aeb5e296/8a9fe/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_1.jpg"></p>

<p>This example is exaggerated but represents a real scenario. When users move really fast the points are further away from each other. When they go slow the points are much closer.</p>

<p>You can see that the algorithm will produce different results for each drawing style. So to ensure that the smoothing is consistent I <strong>normalise</strong> the line so that the gap between points is within a consistent range. I’ll explain more in the next section.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d0b2ed2fd235ab8bda810dc79487591fd2cfb911/07c96/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_8.jpg"></p>

<p>Secondly the algorithm as-is is too fine grained. Points only interact with the ones directly next to them so larger line <em>features</em> can still look bumpy.</p>

<p>To combat this I apply a <strong>super smooth</strong> process which I explain later.</p>





<hr>

<h2 id="normalise">Normalise</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, one issue with the algorithm is that it’s highly affected by how close points are to each other. To combat this I add/remove points to ensure that the gap between points is within a certain range.</p>

<p>Here’s an example - the red dots represent the points. Notice some are far away and some are <em>very</em> close together.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8d196846016bb7229e21f0541b3c3f42a1a230ab/9bdc3/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_4.jpg"></p>

<p>After normalising the line the points would be more evenly distributed. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/142821f88b1d98934f2221930ccd995314cbfe32/57c1f/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_5.jpg"></p>

<p>Now when we smooth the line the points behave similarly. Remember our example from before?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/77ed07e4402adfe56cc478289b7bba56aeb5e296/8a9fe/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_1.jpg"></p>

<p>It would smooth out like this after being normalised:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/25269d0ed7196f083e55b3c77fd34017f8462a2e/96ee1/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Now that we can control the gap distance the smoothing will behave consistently regardless of how fast/slow the user draws their line.</p>

<p>This is the basic process of how it’s done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I step through the line and compare every pair of adjacent points</li>
  <li>I add a new point if the gap is larger than the tolerance range
    <ul>
      <li>The new point is placed in the middle of the two points</li>
      <li>I keep adding points until the gap is within tolerance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I remove a point if the gap is smaller than the tolerance range
    <ul>
      <li>I keep removing points until the gap is within tolerance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="super-smooth">Super smooth</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before the algorithm is too fine-grained. Even after we normalise the line we will still see bumps. This is because we’re smoothing out individual <em>points</em>, not bigger line <em>features</em>.</p>

<p>Take this line for example. We can see it has been smoothed out yet it still has bumps. The <em>points</em> have been smoothed, but the bigger <em>features</em> make it look bumpy.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b2a8f3c9153312802cfb8d71a4f59c549dd8237e/67fad/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_xsmooth_1.jpg"></p>

<p>We <em>could</em> remove points but we’ve already normalised the line by now. We don’t want to reduce the amount of information we have to play with.</p>

<p>Instead I adjusted the algorithm slightly. Rather than smooth a point with just it’s direct neighbours, I added the ability to use points further away.</p>

<p>In this example you can see how the smoothing uses the points 2 positions away instead of just 1 like before.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/33e7aa2eb3e3cb48297ccb0b0ebe0af682d3afdc/0a864/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_xsmooth_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Let’s go bigger. Below is the process applied using points 5 positions away. Note that I ran the smoothing process a number of times.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d145f55f7c42484ec970559c5b8234bca9edaab9/2c295/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_band_10.jpg"></p>

<p>And here is another using points that are 10 positions away. Again I ran the process multiple times.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3f8d83df99a4267c1f15ded351559f1eb3422ea4/a9f17/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_band_20.jpg"></p>

<p>Notice something? Yeah it looks crap! You can see that points bunch up to create ugly artefacts.</p>

<p>But at least the points are interacting with a wider spread of neighbouring points. They’re affecting larger <em>features</em> of a line now.</p>

<p>Fixing the artefacts turned out to be quite easy. I simply run the smoothing process with 20, 18, … , 2, 1 positions away in succession. The result looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ecf8d9d9be46368e3504ca1ae69c48d120395ec0/026d1/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_band_smooth.jpg"></p>

<p>Buttery smooth right? So now the algorithm will smooth out the bigger features first, then slowly refine the line into beautiful buttery goodness. The result is a super smooth line 👌</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2e13afce0ffe62ff1c54a85902b94159dd3b88ae/6178f/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_result.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="lets-animate-it">Let’s animate it</h2>

<p>So to turn this algorithm into actual icing I simply run the algorithm live as the user draws. The smoothing gives the icing that ‘sticky’ feeling.</p>

<p>This is the basic idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a list of the original coordinates</li>
  <li>When the user starts to draw do this:
    <ul>
      <li>Add new points to the original coordinate list</li>
      <li>Normalise the new points within the list</li>
      <li>Copy the list and run the super smoother process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The smoothed path is ready to be drawn on screen</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it! You can now implement your very own buttery smooth smoothing algorithm. Go make some icing, snakes, or whatever you can think of. Path smoothing has a lot of uses I reckon.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>The final step of the process is making this thing performant. You can imagine that if you let the user draw indefinitely the list will get HUGE.</p>

<p>Given that the algorithm loops over the list a lot, you can see that the number of computations scales linearly with the length of the line.</p>

<p>Eventually this will degrade the performance of your app. In practise I found my app to slow down within seconds of drawing.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/142a4be842a3c8c620cf38e6e8ddaeb1614b68d0/c9e8c/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_cache.jpg"></p>

<p>The combat this I ‘cache’ the smooth portion of the line and only deal with the end.</p>

<p>Notice in the image that the two lines at the end share the same beginning portion. This occurs because the algorithm is proximity based. New points will eventually stop affecting older ones.</p>

<p>Now I only ever have to process a small segment of the line at any time. The result is a fast algorithm that that can run continuously as the user draws.</p>





<hr>



<p>Baring the actual algorithm implementation, how could we perform this type of processing and render it in Flutter? You know I love them, it’s another mixin!</p>

<p>In this example the <code>PathSmoother</code> class holds my smoothing algorithm logic. I then expose some helper methods to interact with it from a stateful widget.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'package:flutter/material.dart'</span><span>;</span>

<p>My Twitter feels like a local library. Each one of my Twitter friends is tending to their own little corner of the internet, sharing their best material, and responding to my random research questions. There are a lot of knowledgable folks out there, but <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/[@visakanv](https://twitter.com/visakanv">Visakan Veerasamy</a> is the ultimate librarian. I like to think of him as the crown prince of Nerd Twitter —&nbsp;a writer, creator, and curator who’s so prolific he doesn’t recognize himself. Visa is playing the Twitter game on a whole new level. He’s constructing a digital version of his brain, and his curation style feels like an early iteration of something that might one day go mainstream. It’s a knowledge creation and exploration ethos that feels more true to the original “web” and more fit for how we think.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/visa.png">
<em>Visa’s Twitter profile, complete with his personal web of values.</em></p>

<p>Inspired by his huge web of knowledge, I sent out a tweet three months ago that said: “I think I would legit pay for @visakanv as a service. $10/mo for him to respond to all of my random musings with his own thoughts, content recommendations, and links to relevant threads. This service would be like Mario racing turbo boost for the mind!”</p>

<p>To my surprise, Visa responded within a few minutes. “Happy to do this,” he said, and shared a link to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/visakanv">Patreon</a>.</p>

<h3>A brief history of tweetstorms</h3>

<p>Visa’s digital brain is made up of Twitter threads. He didn’t invent the medium, but he’s pushed it to its limits.</p>

<p>When Marc Andreessen started tweeting in 2014, he didn’t let the 140-character limit stop him from posting his thoughts at length. Instead of shortening his tweets, he started stringing them together by replying to himself. Thus was born the tweetstorm. At first, tweetstorms were a hack. And they were mildly <a href="http://expletiveinserted.com/2014/07/02/taming-tweetstorms/">controversial</a>. Gawker once <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-ceo-posts-13-tweet-apology-without-answering-a-sin-1660229634">slammed</a> Travis Kalanick’s use of a tweetstorm, calling it “a series of thoughts that give the illusion of substance and circumspection because they are presented in a numerical order.” Tech blogger/investor M.G. Siegler raged against them in 2014:</p>

<blockquote><p>1/ In theory, 2/ I love Tweetstorms 3/ and have long wanted a feature like this myself. 4/ But in practice, 5/ I f*cking hate them. 6/ They flow in the tweet stream about as nicely as vomit out of an esophagus. 7/ They ruin the experience of the stream by breaking what Twitter is, 8/ a service to share short thoughts quickly 9/ and let others reply to those in some semblance of order.</p></blockquote>

<p>At first, creating tweetstorms was a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/08/21/twitter-jargon-illustrated-rt-mt-canoes-darth/">very manual process</a>, and they weren’t very easy to read or share. Fast-forward three years: in 2017, Twitter officially productized tweestorms and rebranded them as “threads.” Suddenly, it was much simpler to string tweets together and share the resulting thread as a unit. This product change created the infrastructure on which Visa and others are currently spinning their webs.</p>

<h3>Resurrecting the Memex</h3>

<p>I found Visa’s threads sometime last year, and I’ve been crawling across them ever since. Whereas Marc Andressen’s threads were mostly self-contained, Visa’s are linked together. They form a giant web of interconnected thoughts. There’s no beginning or ending or map or wayfinding or sense of where you are in his tapestry. There are just threads of threads of threads that seem to extend into infinity —&nbsp;an ever-expanding network of Visa’s ideas and discoveries. At each node, there’s usually a full-on discussion taking place between his followers. Visa has constructed what feels like a whole new medium on top of the bedrock of Twitter. Here’s a representative thread for you to explore:</p>

<blockquote data-lang="en"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’ve been stewing this theory for 1 year +:</p><p>Just as how the WWE isn’t a wrestling show, but a show ABOUT a wrestling show,</p><p>mainstream media is less about the news than a participatory interactive tv show ABOUT the news</p><p>Cable News Network is really Cable News Entertainment <a href="https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI">https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI</a></p></div>— Visa is in SF until May 8! 🌉 (@visakanv) <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1004190525270851584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2018</a></blockquote>





<p>Visa’s threads are doing to Twitter what hyperlinks did to dead-tree text. They link things together across time and space. Without thread-webs, most tweets get left behind in the past. A web of tweets allows people to rediscover older thoughts and connect them with newer ones.</p>

<p>These threads bear a family resemblance to the vision of an early 20th-century computer pioneer named Vannevar Bush. In 1945, he wrote a now-famous article called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>, which described a knowledge device he called the Memex:</p>

<blockquote><p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate [his] mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways, he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed of flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence an clarity of the items resurrected from storage … <strong>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/memex.jpg"></p>

<p>Bush’s vision of associative trails has been realized in some corners of the web, like Wikipedia. But most content is organized in the reverse-chronological stream (also known as the feed or the timeline). Social media sites have made information consumption a very linear process. We scroll down infinitely long pages that are (roughly) organized from newest to oldest. Content that’s more than a week old is fossilized under the endless dump of new posts, links, pictures. On social media, time is the main ordering principle. Creating new content feels like throwing a leaf into a roaring river. It’s not attached to anything — it just floats on by, doomed to be forgotten within a matter of seconds. We don’t really “surf” the web anymore. Unless we’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace">Wiki-racing</a>, we’re not hopping from hyperlink to hyperlink on a surprising journey across  human knowledge. We scroll, click, scroll click.</p>

<p>I see Visa’s Twitter threads as a response to this boring linearity&nbsp;— an attempt to make things hang together. We’re associative beings. We make sense of things by relating them to other things. As Joshua Foer wrote in his book <em>Moonwalking With Einstein:</em> “It takes knowledge to gain knowledge. Memory is like a spiderweb that catches information. The more it catches, the bigger it grows. And the bigger it grows, the more it catches.”</p>

<h3>The spread of threads</h3>

<p>I’ve noticed that the threading impulse is beginning to expand beyond Twitter. It’s popping up in more and more corners of the web. At Ribbonfarm, Venkatesh Rao is experimenting with a new genre called “<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/21/constructions-in-magical-thinking/">blogchains</a>,” in which a bunch of blog posts are linked together around a single theme. It’s different than a traditional series because it’s “improvised rather than planned, is responsive to salient events in the environment, evolves at a certain tempo, is structurally a way to <em>build over time</em>, is suitable for multi-author collaboration, is capable of supporting an inter-process messaging protocol with adjacent blogchains, has no necessary or scripted ‘ending.’” The blogchain seems like a direct descendant of the Twitter thread — an attempt to experiment with the medium outside the confines of Twitter’s more rigid platform.</p>

<p>At Epsilon Theory, Ben Hunt created what he calls a <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/discovery-map-december-31-2018/">Discovery Map</a>. It’s an interactive visualization that displays all 300 of his blog posts as a network graph. The nodes of the network are organized in thematic clusters. Instead of scrolling down a reverse-chronological feed, you can surf across related posts and see connections across time. This feels like a genuinely new way of interacting with blog content, and it serves as an interesting answer to the question “Where should I start?”</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/discovery-map.png"></p>

<p>The most interesting non-linear threading product I’ve discovered is called <a href="http://are.na/">Are.na</a>. It’s like Pinterest, but for nerds. Are.na lets you organize “Blocks” (text, links, photos) into thematic “Channels”. For example, I’m currently collecting material for channels called “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/deep-history-8mjcwnu9nia">Deep history</a>” and “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/culture-wars-2-0">Culture wars 2.0</a>”. Other people can easily add blocks to your channels, and you can include their channels inside your own. Channels can be rearranged, renamed, connected in novel ways. On Are.na, you’re a spider spinning a knowledge web alongside a bunch of other curious spiders. You never know how your webs might connect. I’ve started searching for things on Are.na (instead of Google) because every block lives inside a channel that’s connected to a lot of related content. Whereas a Google search result feels like a dead-end, an Arena block feels like an unexpected beginning.</p>

<p>What’s frustrating about blogging is that each post feels static and final. It’s not very alive as a medium. I wish it were easier for posts to evolve over time, sprout offshoots, find collaborators. The hyperlink is a pretty crude technology for connecting things together. Visa’s threads, Ribbonfarm’s blogchains, Epsilon Theory’s Discovery Map, and Are.na’s channels are all pointing to a model of content creation and consumption that’s more fit for the way our minds actually work. Threads are a more fluid and malleable medium. Finding someone’s thread-web feels like the digital equivalent of perusing the bookshelves in their home. You don’t have to know what you’re looking for, but you’re usually pleasantly surprised by what you find.</p>

<p>For the last few months, Visa has been replying to my tweets with links to his relevant thread-webs. Each random thought I tweet becomes a new entry point into the collection he’s been curating for years. He’d probably do this if I weren’t supporting him on Patreon, but I believe his threading experiment is an extremely valuable service. As the internet grows more complex, we’re going to need people who can string things together across time and …</p></article></section></div>

<p>HONOLULU, HI — June 23, 2020 – Ocean Voyages Institute’s marine plastic recovery vessel, S/V KWAI, docked at the port of Honolulu today, after a 48-day expedition, successfully removing 103 tons (206,000 lbs.) of fishing nets and consumer plastics from the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone, more commonly known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch or Gyre.</p>



<p>Establishing its lead in open ocean clean-up, Ocean Voyages Institute has set a new record with the largest at sea clean-up in the Gyre to date, more than doubling its own results from last year.</p>



<p>“I am so proud of our hard working crew,” says <strong>Mary Crowley</strong>, founder and executive director of Ocean Voyages Institute. “We exceeded our goal of capturing 100 tons of toxic consumer plastics and derelict ‘ghost’ nets, and in these challenging times, we are continuing to help restore the health of our ocean, which influences our own health and the health of the planet.”</p>



<p>Crowley adds: “The oceans can’t wait for these nets and debris to break down into microplastics which impair the ocean’s ability to store carbon and toxify the fragile ocean food web.”</p>



<p>Known as the “Ghost Net Buster,” Crowley is renowned for developing effective methods to remove significant amounts of plastics out of the ocean, including 48 tons (96,000 lbs.) of toxic plastics during two ocean clean-ups in 2019, one from the Gyre and one from the waters surrounding the Hawaiian islands.</p>



<p>“There is no cure-all solution to ocean clean-up: It is the long days at sea, with dedicated crew scanning the horizon, grappling nets, and retrieving huge amounts of trash, that makes it happen,” says <strong>Locky MacLean</strong>, a former director at Sea Shepherd and ocean campaigner in marine conservation for two decades.</p>

<p>The GPS satellite trackers used by Ocean Voyages Institute since 2018 are proving Crowley’s theory that one tracker can lead to many nets. The ocean frequently sorts debris so that a tagged fishing net can lead to other nets and a density of debris within a 15 mile radius.</p>



<p>The Pacific Gyre, located halfway between Hawaii and California, is the largest area with the most plastic, of the five major open ocean plastic accumulation regions, or Gyres, in the world’s oceans.</p>



<p>“We are utilizing proven nautical equipment to effectively clean-up the oceans while innovating with new technologies,” says Crowley. “Ocean Voyages Institute has been a leader in researching and accomplishing ocean clean-up for over a decade, granted with less fanfare and attention than others, but with passion and commitment and making meaningful impacts.”</p>



<p>Ocean Voyages Institute will be unloading the record-breaking haul of ocean plastic debris while docked alongside Pier 29 thanks to the support of Honolulu-based Matson, in preparation for upcycling and proper disposal.</p>

<p>“In keeping with our commitment to environmental stewardship, Matson has been searching for a way to get involved in cleaning up the Pacific Gyre,” said <strong>Matt Cox</strong>, chairman and CEO. “We’ve been impressed with the groundbreaking efforts of Ocean Voyages Institute and the progress they’ve made with such a small organization, and we hope our support will help them continue this important work.”</p>



<h3>An Expanded 2020 Expedition</h3>



<p>When the sailing cargo ship, S/V KWAI, arrived in Honolulu today, it completed a 48-day at sea clean-up mission that began at the Hawaiian port of Hilo on May 4, after a three week self- imposed quarantine period to ensure the health of crew members and safety of the mission, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>During the expedition, the KWAI’s multinational crew collected marine plastic pollution with the help of GPS satellite trackers that Ocean Voyages Institute designed with engineer <strong>Andy Sybrandy</strong>, of <a href="https://www.pacificgyre.com/">Pacific Gyre, Inc</a>. These beacons are placed on nets by volunteer yachts and ships. Drones, as well as lookouts up the mast, enable the ship’s crew to hone in on the debris. They then recover the litter, place it in industrial bags, and store it in the ship’s cargo hold for proper recycling and repurposing at the end of the voyage.</p>



<p>S/V KWAI, led by <strong>Captain Brad Ives</strong>, and Ocean Voyages Institute are planning a second voyage to the Gyre departing the end of June to continue clean-up of this area, which is so besieged by toxic debris. The length of a second summer leg will be determined by how successful Ocean Voyages Institute is in securing additional donations.</p>

<p>“Our solutions are scalable, and next year, we could have three vessels operating in the North Pacific Gyre for three months all bringing in large cargos of debris,” says Crowley. “We are aiming to expand to other parts of the world desperately needing efficient clean-up technologies.”</p>



<p>Crowley adds: “There is no doubt in my mind that our work is making the oceans healthier for the planet and safer for marine wildlife, as these nets will never again entangle or harm a whale, dolphin, turtle or reefs.”</p>

<p>…or sculpturing is not that bad for health ;P</p>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Well, it just had to be this pic:)</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h4>The story</h4>
<p>Some time ago, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion/Bonzai</a> asked me to fix his SX-64 keyboard. I was like … hell yeah! … I’ve never worked on SX-64 gear. The problem was, at that moment I didn’t know what was wrong with that keyboard … until pics arrived</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=29175">Yugorin</a> run an awesome website – <a href="https://c64portal.pl/">c64portal.pl</a> – The website is in Polish and contains lots of valuable info about Polish Commodore demoscene and Commodore in general. Both gentlemen are also the main guys behind the <a href="https://moonshinedragons.party/">Moonshine Dragons party – currently, the largest C64 party in Poland.</a></p>
<p>Since I already agreed that I’ll fix it, there was no excuse. Carrion sent me that keyboard and the party has begun 🙂</p>

<p>I had to remove the original stickers. That was done using a hotair gun set to 100 degrees C</p>

<h4>Plastic welding and reinforcements</h4>
<p>As it turned out, after close inspection, there were way more cracks than I thought.</p>
<p>All these cracks had to be addressed and reinforced – <a href="https://retrohax.net/extreme-refurbishing-episode-2-atari-800-xl-part-one/">this is a lesson that I’ve learned after my Atari 800 XL refurb</a> where joints were not stable enough and resulted in tiny cracks over time.</p>
<p>To achieve a proper result, I’ve welded in a brass mesh to serve as a reinforcement of cracked spots and as a base for resin-based compounds used later to rebuild missing plastic. Obviously, the mesh had to be custom cut.</p>
<p>This is how the process looks.</p>

<p>Once every piece was cut to a proper size, I’ve soldered them together. I’ve also added a thicker copper wire to make the mesh stiffer and less prone to bending.</p>

<h4>Rebuilding missing plastic</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was ready to apply fiber-glass putty. This is a quite messy process and looks kinda ugly. I’ve used some old PCB laminate to get every edge correctly positioned and as close to the original as possible. This part boils down to pretty much three things – putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … etc. etc.</p>

<p>After making slots, I could start trying on the bottom part against the top. Unfortunately, one of the hooks snapped off during the process 🙁</p>
<p>I had to fix it first. I’ve made it out of a metal paper clip that was cut down to size and welded in a top case.</p>

<h4>Epoxy resin and finishing</h4>
<p>After all the above work was done, I’ve mixed a cup of thin epoxy resin to fill in hard to access gaps and spots. It also helped to smoothen all uneven surfaces. The resin was applied to all spots with brass mesh with a plastic pipette.</p>

<p>Once the resin cured, I’ve applied a layer of spray putty which helped me to spot all minor mistakes and correct them with finishing putty and 400 grit sandpaper.</p>

<p>After another round of putty and sanding, I’ve applied black undercoating which was then wet-sanded with 1000 grit this time.</p>

<p>Finally, I could apply the last two layers of custom made spray paint. This paint color exactly matches the original. These custom spray paints for various computers will be available in my <a href="https://retrohax.net/">webshop</a> soon. The first series of spray paints will include the following colors:</p>
<ul><li> Atari XL Beige</li><li> Atari XE/ST Gray</li><li> Commodore 64C Beige</li><li> Amiga 500 Beige </li></ul>

<h4>Badges and plastics</h4>
<p>Due to its age, paint from a badge chipped off during removal so I had to fix it. I’ve used a standard black marker to cover all these tiny spots. Later, I’ve removed old glue from the rubber base and applied fresh double-sided adhesive tape on both rubber and badge.</p>

<p>I also had to address other scratched plastic parts. That was easily fixed by applying a thin layer of silicone oil.</p>

<h4>Keyboard cleaning</h4>
<p>Obviously, all keycaps had to be clean. This time, I had to remove every single keycap and clean it individually. It took a while to get it done properly 🙂</p>

<p>Don’t ask me why so late but this is the moment when I’ve realized there is a major failure :/</p>
<p>I’ve no idea why I didn’t spot it earlier. After assembly, it turned out that there is a small gap between parts. It is barely visible and only from a side of the case but I was pissed off at myself that I didn’t spot it and fix it before the case was painted.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/k6m1xzj.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/k6m1xzj.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Obviously, I didn’t have any spray paint left.</p>
<h4>The grand finale</h4>
<p>This restoration was rather time-consuming. It took more or less 15 workdays. This is because I had to wait for chemistry to fully cure before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p>So here it is. Fully restored Commodore SX-64 keyboard for Carrion. Hopefully, he will like it 🙂</p>

After a user enters their enter email address, we direct them to their inbox to tap a link to sign in. Before diving into what went wrong, here's a snapshot of our authentication funnel:</p><ul><li><strong>11% of users</strong> required at least 4 magic-link emails before completing signing up.</li><li><strong>18% of users never finished signup (clicked the magic link)</strong>. On average, these users attempted signup twice, with several users submitting &gt; 10 times.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="-why-would-you-use-magic-link-anyways">... why would you use magic link, anyways?</h2><p>Friends are core to SnapHabit, so the functionality to send a friend request is critical. Phone number or email felt like the cheapest way to support a unique identifier — as it could be used for both authentication and finding a friend.</p><p>Like most services, we first looked at using "Sign in with Google/Facebook". However, Apple recently adjusted App Store Guidelines... starting June 30, <strong>"apps that use a social login service ... must also offer Sign in with Apple"</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-3.47.00-PM-2.png"><figcaption>App Store Guidelines, June 17, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Apple Sign In supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425">"Hide My Email"</a>, so many users who sign in with Apple would not have a meaningful email attached to their account. Asking for a user's email after they chose to "hide it" would be a poor user experience.</p><p>So in summary, we had 4 options for account creation:</p><ol><li><strong>Email + Password</strong> ... requires forgot password and users to prove email ownership</li><li><strong>Support all third-party (Apple, Google, Facebook)</strong> ... and add a new unique identifier to allow friends to find each other, given email will not be sufficient</li><li><strong>Phone number magic link</strong> ... we were relying on Expo (previously did not support phone-number auth), and we also felt emails would be a good/cheap tool for communication</li><li><strong>Email magic link</strong> </li></ol><p>Email magic link felt... perfect! &nbsp;We built the login flow, complete with a custom email, instructional webpage, and deep linking. <strong>Hurrah, we had cracked the authentication funnel!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QoS2-mIuOZw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="what-went-wrong-and-how-we-tried-to-solve">What went wrong and how we tried to solve</h2><p><em>If you're interested in the technical details of how we implemented some of these fixes, let me know and we'll consider publishing.</em></p><h3 id="1-users-clicking-the-link-on-another-device-">1.

There are two routes to solving this:</p><ul><li>technical solution to support this behavior (clicking the link on desktop will authenticate the user on mobile)</li><li>better instructional text</li></ul><p><strong>The latter was simpler, so we started with that:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/firstattempt.png"></figure><p><strong>And again.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/email.png"></figure><p><strong>And more.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/landingpage.png"></figure><h3 id="2-user-confusion-about-clicking-a-link-to-login">2.

The release of custom Apple chips, powered by ARM, comes after a long history of using Intel-based chips, for the greater part of the 21st century.</p><p id="0fc0">Modeled after Apple’s use of its own chips on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, the company is switching to its own chips to give the Mac more performance per watt and better GPU performance.</p><p id="ecaf">Though we won’t go in-depth into the specific implications for machine learning, there’s a lot to be excited about when it comes to the future of ML development on Mac. Inevitably, the enhanced GPU performance will be a boon to machine learning developers, with benefits ranging from faster model training to reduced reliance on transfer learning. It will be interesting to see how ML engineers capitalize on Apple Silicon over time.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="10c8">The Mac, often considered Apple’s flagship lineup, has seen a couple changes in the past. Let’s look at what those changes were and how they’ve contributed to the evolution of the Mac.</p><h2 id="114e">Motorola 68K to PowerPC</h2><p id="d699">One of the earliest transitions in chip architecture was the transition from Motorola 68K chips to IBM and Motorola PowerPC chips. This was an incredible transition, which significantly improved the Mac and played an important role in understanding future transitions.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png?q=20" width="780" height="439" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1560/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png" width="780" height="439" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>The original iMac with a PowerPC processor.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ed43">PowerPC to Intel x86</h2><p id="6ac1">The most notable transition was the move from PowerPC chips to Intel processors, which have been used for almost half of the Mac’s history so far. With this transition, Apple announced a developer kit to help with the transition, similar to what they announced in the switch to Apple Silicon.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png?q=20" width="1200" height="675" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>A recent, Intel-based MacBook Pro.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="4c63">Undoubtedly, a switch to ARM-based Macs has a huge advantage for the performance and usability of Macs. Let’s look at how Apple Silicon will improve the Mac’s experience.</p><h2 id="71ef">Performance per Watt</h2><p id="e98c">Apple Silicon promises a stark improvement in performance per watt, meaning that the Mac could potentially promise desktop-level performance with the power consumption of a notebook computer, as exemplified by Apple’s diagram:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png?q=20" width="1720" height="953" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3440/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png" width="1720" height="953" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Performance per watt for Apple Silicon</figcaption></figure><h2 id="95f4">Native Apps</h2><p id="b37d">Apps that support Apple Silicon natively will perform best on the new ARM-based Macs. Out-of-the-box, Apple’s own apps, including pro apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, will have native support for Apple Silicon. In addition, through their collaboration with Adobe, the Creative Cloud Suite will also have native support from the get-go. Eventually, Microsoft Office and other widely used programs will be able to take advantage of Apple Silicon’s performance.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png?q=20" width="1080" height="607" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png" width="1080" height="607" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Photoshop running natively on an ARM-based Mac.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2e35">iOS Apps on Mac</h2><p id="3611">Another incredible benefit of using the ARM architecture across iOS, macOS, and watchOS is the ability to run iOS apps natively on Apple Silicon Macs. Without any additional work from the developer, most iOS apps can be installed from the Mac App Store.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png?q=20" width="3359" height="1891" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6718/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png" width="3359" height="1891" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Running Monument Valley and Fender Play, two popular iOS apps, on a Mac.</figcaption></figure><p id="4f66">To help developers transition their apps to support Apple Silicon, Apple has announced a whole host of tools to make native and simulated support for Apple Silicon as smooth as possible for users.</p><h2 id="0ebc">Universal 2</h2><p id="8277">As the name suggests, Universal 2 allows developers to quickly compile their apps for Apple Silicon while retaining support for Intel-based Macs. By using Universal 2 in Xcode, developers will be able to use the same binary for both Intel-based Macs, while providing a native experience for those who are using a Mac with Apple Silicon.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png?q=20" width="3360" height="2100" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6720/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png" width="3360" height="2100" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Universal 2 for the same binary for Intel and ARM-based Macs.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="38e9">Rosetta 2</h2><p id="49cb">An upgrade from their previous version of Rosetta (for the Intel transition), Rosetta 2 provides similar capabilities as its previous counterpart — allowing Intel-based apps to run on Apple Silicon Macs. So if app developers haven’t yet recompiled their apps with Universal 2, their users can still access legacy versions of the app through Rosetta 2.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png?q=20" width="3360" height="2100" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6720/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png" width="3360" height="2100" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Rosetta 2 for install-time translation for Intel-based apps.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="b5ed">Virtualization</h2><p id="d298">For developers who need to use Linux, Docker, or similar tools, Apple has also announced virtualization tools for ARM Macs. These tools are expected to provide a seamless transition to Apple Silicon for developers who need server-side development tools.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png?q=20" width="3359" height="1884" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6718/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png" width="3359" height="1884" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Running an Apache server on an ARM-based Mac.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="f765">Developer Transition Kit</h2><p id="81af">Similar to the Intel transition, developers will be able to purchase a Developer Transition Kit, which comprises a Mac Mini enclosure fitted with the A12Z SoC — used on the latest iPad lineup. The Mac Mini will have 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD — plenty for development needs. Also, macOS Big Sur and Xcode 12 will come pre-installed on the machine, which will be available for $500 (half the price of the Intel transition kit).</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png?q=20" width="1080" height="607" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png" width="1080" height="607" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Apple’s Mac Mini Based Developer Transition Kit</figcaption></figure><p id="de05">While Apple isn’t completely transitioning to Apple Silicon just yet, the announcement of their ARM-based chip for Mac is a huge step in a two year process to change Mac for the better.</p><p id="04c2">Stay tuned for some great new tutorials on the latest frameworks this week, and get ahead of the crowd by taking use of them before they’re released to the public in the fall.</p><p id="3993">In case you missed it, here’s the Keynote in all its glory:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6139">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this article</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d325"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

      <div><p>Facebook censorship has effectively barred my business from their platform and is materially impacting the livelihood of my customers.</p>
<p>For the past decade, Iâ€™ve run an online portfolio business on the side called <a href="https://foliohd.com/" target="_blank">FolioHD</a>. (You get a subdomain on the platform to host your portfolio, like mine at <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no insight into the offending content, and the offending content can be anything from a nippleÂ&nbsp;to now apparently <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/23/project-veritas-facebook-sting-moderators-brag-abo/" target="_blank">even a MAGA hat</a>.</p>
<p>Now I am personally blocked on Instagram from liking photos or sending DMs. I canâ€™t sign into my company Instagram account. And Facebook has reached into my Pageâ€™s support inbox and removed private message between myself and customers.<br></p><p><b>How I noticed</b></p><p>A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my personal Instagram and double-tapped a photo. Instead of seeing a red heart, I received this message.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22" title="Image: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22"><br></p><p>Tapping â€œTell usâ€� simply says, â€œThanks for reporting this issue.â€�</p>
<p>In my Instagram bio is a link to my personal portfolio, <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>. Because of this link, I effectively became completely blocked from interacting with anyone on Instagram.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9db49566-898e-4743-a776-f38d5d97de0f/Screenshot_20200603-071310.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171521Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=fe284180ac384a5fcc2a2e80620b1591f6591c68f53de08d85c8379d579c0332&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200603-071310.png%22"><br></p><p>As the result of a single person sharing a link to a portfolio that Facebook deemed to have offensive content, they have now blocked the entire <a href="http://foliohd.com/">foliohd.com</a> domain.</p>
<p>It even prevented me from sending direct messages with ANY links.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e21b85f5-439c-4956-b8f1-5f3d7af98cc4/Screenshot_20200619-2203122.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171544Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7871c844ed24cdd872248679c05a4d8f3839c5a86be8849fe1467fa70036467f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200619-2203122.png%22"><br></p><p>In order to restore my personal Instagram account, Iâ€™d have to remove the URL from my bio.</p>
<p>Using Facebookâ€™s Sharing Debugger confirms the URL was blocked on the entire Facebook ecosystem.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ad2152fc-2508-4d44-af6b-6919b7aa6879/7474EA49-DE9C-431B-AA3B-2FCFCB41C0D6.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171615Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=b09b9fa953466ec52e76fe5e106c82fe45b016c76167b551bbc2ef98a7a6da40&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%227474EA49-DE9C-431B-AA3B-2FCFCB41C0D6.jpeg%22"><br></p><p>Of course Facebook has a way to report this issue on their developer site, but we know where those messages go. (A giant black hole.)<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/381da3b4-f1cc-43fa-9d47-8eac7fd20337/77F62DF6-5BFE-43BA-BC3D-5A21AC463B26.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171640Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=84831d9fcbca7433e84e476e3d8df870cbd7f76029a8940b60466264e883cfeb&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%2277F62DF6-5BFE-43BA-BC3D-5A21AC463B26.jpeg%22"><br></p><p>But the problems donâ€™t end there. Since Instagram has been seamlessly integrated into the Facebook ecosystem, any account containing a blocked URL on Facebook has related consequences on Instagram.</p>
<p>I canâ€™t sign into the FolioHD Instagram account, because Facebook wonâ€™t send a security code by email, presumably because it has <a href="http://foliohd.com/">foliohd.com</a> in the email.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e202aab8-6473-434f-ae77-76d2d35af868/0AEC68F1-F197-4BE2-9DD7-2ECB093730AB.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171702Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=604194c7fa9965b2b07f147e2f57aefa4f404cb93aa07187f1fae7bbf69e0f8c&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%220AEC68F1-F197-4BE2-9DD7-2ECB093730AB.jpeg%22"><br></p><p>But it gets worse: Visiting the FolioHD Facebook support inbox has led me to discover that Facebook is removing private messages between customers and myself, because they contain a link to <a href="http://foliohd.com/" target="_blank">foliohd.com</a> inside of them.<br></p><div id="posthaven_gallery[1591206]">

        </div>
<p>Iâ€™m thankful I donâ€™t rely on the Facebook support inbox, but I do have an auto-reply set up for anyone who sends a message there, directing them to contact support via <a href="http://foliohd.com/">foliohd.com</a>.</p>
<p>Since Facebook is blocking links, that auto-reply no longer gets sent.</p>
<p>Any social posts created through a Buffer-style service, even using a bitly link, gets posted briefly, then removed, with no notice.</p>
<p>And the worst part: there is no way to resolve this.</p>
<p>Now my customers can no longer share links to their websites within the Facebook ecosystem. They had nothing to do with this, and yet their businesses are being affected.<br></p><p><b>My ask</b></p><p>My request to Facebook would be to reconsider how they handle sites with user-generated content, in the same way Google handles it in their index. If a subdomain contains offending content, it shouldnâ€™t poison the root domain and every other subdomain.</p>
<p>And Facebook should probably never weasel their way into private company inboxes to remove content retroactively. You break the trust of any business by pulling these kind of moves. How can we rely on you for anything if your censorship is a moving target?</p>
<p>And if anyone knows how to get Facebook to fix this, please let me know. Short of filing a lawsuit, Iâ€™m not sure how to get this resolved.<br></p></div>

<p>We present a simple to use implementation of networking across ultrasonic frequencies, by making use of Gnuradio and a microphone and speakers. This allows you to use <strong>TCP/IP</strong>,<strong>UDP</strong> across an audio link.</p>



<p>In order to follow this tutorial we recommend you use the LiveDVD release of Gnuradio (which is basically a Ubuntu distribution, with gnuradio already installed). This is easily downloadable from <a href="https://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31">http://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31</a>. First of all you will need to download the patch we made to Gnuradio, to a USB stick. You can download the patch from <a href="https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip</a>. In order to use the patch, you need to be root, so type <strong>‘sudo bash’</strong>, then unzip the patch, and simply run setup.sh, by typing <strong>./setup.sh</strong>. The setup file simply patches the Gnuradio packet encoder and decoder, in order to support variable length packets.</p>



<p>After running <strong>setup.py</strong>, you can then initialise Gnuradio, which you need to run as root, so do <strong>sudo gnuradio-companion</strong>. And then load a.grc on your first laptop.</p>



<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> depicts our graph which enables us to perform the ultrasonic networking. We will now describe how the graph functions through each block. The first block in the top left, is the TUNTAP PDU, this allows you to create a virtual network interface, through which we can send and receive packets.</p>



<p>We use the “PDU to tagged Stream” block to convert the packets received from the virtual NIC, into a byte stream for the packet encoder to process. We can’t directly attach the output of the tagged stream to the GFSK modulator, as we need to add a checksum, through the use of CRC and also we need to add a preamble and header onto the packet – this is all achieved through the use of the packet encoder.</p>



<p>A preamble is essentially a series of bits, which can be detected at the receiver end, in order to correctly align bits, to the correct byte boundaries. The packet encoder, also adds a header after the preamble, which states how long the packet is, in bytes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-1024x558.png" alt="Screenshot" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-1024x558.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-300x163.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 1</strong><br></p>



<p>The GFSK modulator essentially performs Frequency Shift Keying modulation. As you can see in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, the frequency of the modulated signal is lower, when a ‘0’ is being sent, than a ‘1’ being sent. We found that in the context of ultrasonic networking using laptops and microphones, that FSK performed better than PSK (Phase Shift Keying – which uses phase changes, to communicate bits), which is another modulation technique.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png" alt="fsk" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png 533w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 2 (courtesy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fsk.svg">wikipedia</a>)</strong></p>



<p>A very important aspect of the GFSK block is the number of Samples/Symbol. We set this to a value of 9. This means that for each symbol received by the modulator, 9 samples are generated. The higher this number the more resilient the signal is to noise, but consequentially the lower the baud rate (which essentially means the longer it takes to send packets).<br>Baud rate refers to the number of symbols which are transferred per second.</p>



<p>We then use the rational resampler block, to make the signal further resilient. For every sample in, it generates 320 out.</p>



<p>We use a frequency-translating FIR filter, to translate the frequency of the incoming signal. We shift the signal by -carrier_tx, which is -19kHz in this example. This is so that the signal is just outside of the human range of hearing.</p>



<p>As we have been working with complex signals at this point, we need to convert the complex output into a floating point output for the audio card, we achieve this through the use of a ‘Complex to Real’ block.</p>



<p>The bottom part of the graph, depicts the receiver section of the program. It essentially performs the same functions, but in reverse.<br>However there are two additional blocks after the ‘Float to complex’ block. The multiply const block, allows you to multiply the output from the microphone by a fixed number. The block after this is a bandpass filter, to only allow a small range of frequencies to pass through to the demodulator, this helps remove a large amount of noise which is present from the microphone’s output.</p>



<p>In <strong>Figure 3</strong>, you will see that there are two graphs. The top graph, depicts the output sent to the transmitter and the bottom graph depicts the input received from the microphone (after a bandpass filter has mean applied to it). There is also a slider present at the top which allows you to multiply the signal from the microphone by a specific value. This is useful when using 2 laptops which are a greater distance away from each other.</p>

<p><strong>Fig. 3</strong><br></p>







<p>Figure 4 depicts the full duplex signalling we use. You can see that we transmit in this example at two different frequencies, 19kHz and 18kHz. This allows both laptops to send their own signal simultaneously.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png" alt="clip"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 4</strong><br></p>







<p>In Gnuradio-companion, you will need to go to Build &gt; Execute, in order to execute the graph. You then need to assign an IP address to the tap0 interface it creates for you. You need to do this through a terminal, typing <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.10</strong> for instance.</p>



<p>You need to perform the same steps on your second laptop, B, but instead this time loading b.grc, and using <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.20</strong>.</p>



<p>We found it was best to assign ARP entries manually to each laptop. In order to assign an ARP entry, on laptop A, <strong>arp -s 192.168.1.20 &lt;Laptop B’s MAC address for tap0&gt; -i tap0</strong></p>



<p>The setup script, which you have initialised on both laptops copied the patched files to Gnuradio, as well as modifying TCP options, in order to allow TCP/IP to work across a very laggy network.</p>


<pre title="">echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries
echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies
echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_synack_retries
</pre>


<p>The first line is necessary in order to enable a client side TCP connection to stay open longer than the default of 20 seconds, before closing.</p>







<p>In order to test the network is functioning correctly we recommend using netcat. To test out TCP/IP connectivity Use <strong>netcat -vv -l 10000</strong> on Laptop A, and connect to it from Laptop B, using <strong>netcat -vv 192.168.1.10 10000</strong>. Because we are using the verbose options, netcat will inform you when a connection to Laptop A has been established, you can then send text from either laptop to the other one.</p>







<p>As the packet encoder and decoder provided by Gnuradio only work with fixed amounts of data, it was necessary to modify them to support the reading of stream tags. The “PDU to tagged stream” tags packets from the tap interface with their size. The packet encoder/decoder can’t process these tags normally, so we altered the packet encoder, to read these tags, and generate the appropriate sized packet from the tap0 frame. The packet decoder, then unencapsulates the packet, and tags the resulting data, with its size.</p>







<p>To give you an idea of the latencies involved please click on the image below, which shows you a wireshark screenshot, showing the server side of a TCP/IP connection. You’ll see it’s slow!</p>

<p>If anyone’s got any suggestions for improvements to the Gnuradio patch I’d be most appreciative (the patch itself was done very quickly).</p>







<p>The following video is from a previous experiment I did to simply test whether we could send data at 23kHz .</p>



<figure><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H0DKRl8XIcU" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>







<p>Minimodem looks like a great program, but as far as I’m aware it supports only FSK. I was keen to try different modulation schemes, which Gnuradio provides many of; I originally tried the setup with PSK.</p>



<p>Also this provided me with an introduction into how some of the techniques used for Software Defined Radio work.</p>



<p><strong>With thanks to the folks on #gnuradio for their help</strong></p>

    <div>
        <p>I wanted to publish this blog post as an extension of my PyCon 2020 poster
of the same name with more information than I could fit in the poster.</p>

<p>I've also recently completed a migration of the
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py">Elasticsearch client library</a>
to <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/async.html">support both sync and async I/O</a>
using some of these techniques.</p>

<p>I hope that my findings will help you on your own journeys :)</p>

<h2>Setting the Stage</h2>

<p>At PyCon 2016 there was a talk named “Building Protocol Libraries The Right Way”
by Cory Benfield that laid out how protocol libraries can be reusable across
projects, more easily verified, and work with both asynchronous and synchronous
I/O by following the sans-I/O design pattern.</p>

<p>Since that talk there have been many protocol implementations using this principle
including HTTP/1.1, 2 and 3, WebSockets, and more. Now that the protocol libraries
are here let’s start developing libraries designed for async and sync I/O!</p>

<h2>Problems You May Run Into</h2>

<p>On the way towards supporting sync and async here is a list of problems
that most projects will run into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t want API differences between async and sync or to maintain two
code-bases of similar code.</li>
<li>Properties and constructors must be synchronous.</li>
<li>Supporting multiple async libraries is a lot of work.</li>
<li>Async functions are different from sync standard library functions.</li>
<li>Classes may be instantiated without a running event loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Figure out where I/O Happens in your API</h3>

<p>The first steps are to figure out which parts of your API need
to handle I/O and what that means for the rest of your API.
Any function that handles I/O all the way down the chain will need
to be async. Explore library structure without putting too much work
into filling in details. Make sure that the types of your API match
up with how users would have to interact with the library, think about
async context managers and generators.</p>

<h3>Async not compatible with Constructors or Properties</h3>

<p>When you’re designing your API most functions can be async without issue,
however there is one important one that can’t be: <code>__init__()</code>. This can
cause problems when you have to call an async function as a part of setup.
A way around this is a factory function that can be async or delaying any
setup that requires async until after you're guaranteed to have an active
event loop (like within an async function).</p>

<p>The issue is even trickier because if your API is meant to be instantiated
within the global scope, for example to be used as a client within a web service.
Then you can’t make any async calls on instantiation because you won’t have an active
event loop.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>
<span>from</span> <span>elasticsearch</span> <span>import</span> <span>AsyncElasticsearch</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span># Most users will want to define their APIs in the</span>
<span># global scope where there isn't a running event loop ...</span>
<span>es</span> <span>=</span> <span>AsyncElasticsearch</span><span>()</span>

<span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>index</span><span>():</span>
    <span># ... so we can delay our async setup until an</span>
    <span># async function called for the first time.</span>
    <span>resp</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>es</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Using @property is also sync-only and so should either be converted to a
function or design your API such that all results are awaited /
populated before using properties.</p>

<h2>Useful Libraries for Async + Sync Support</h2>

<p>Each library solves one of two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support both async and sync in the same codebase</li>
<li>Support multiple async libraries (Asyncio, Trio)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like to view a simple project using all of these tools together
I have created one on GitHub.</p>

<h3>Unasync</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/python-trio/unasync/">Unasync</a>
is a library that tokenizes your Python code, transforms tokens for
async code into their synchronous counterparts, and then re-renders the new
synchronous code into a corresponding file.</p>

<p>See the code examples on the right for some of the tokens that unasync transforms:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span># Classed prefixed with 'AsyncX...' are helpfully</span>
<span># renamed to 'SyncX...' for simpler imports.</span>
<span>class</span> <span>AsyncClass</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>   <span># -&gt; class SyncClass: ...</span>

<span># async/await is handled by removing the</span>
<span># async and await keywords.</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>              <span># -&gt; def f(): ...</span>
<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>f</span><span>()</span>                 <span># -&gt; ret = f()</span>

<span># Async context managers are transformed</span>
<span># into regular context managers.</span>
<span>async</span> <span>with</span> <span>ctx</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>           <span># with ctx(): ...</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>__aenter__</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>     <span># def __enter__(): ...</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>__aexit__</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>_</span><span>):</span> <span>...</span>    <span># def __exit__(*_): ...</span>

<span># Async iterators are transformed into</span>
<span># regular iterators.</span>
<span>await</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>__aiter__</span><span>()</span>             <span># -&gt; x.__iter__()</span>
<span>await</span> <span>iter</span><span>.</span><span>__anext__</span><span>()</span>          <span># -&gt; iter.__next__()</span>
<span>async</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>           <span># -&gt; for x in y: ...</span>
<span>StopAsyncIteration</span>              <span># -&gt; StopIteration</span>

<span># Typing annotations, notice unasync also</span>
<span># handles forward annotations within strings.</span>
<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"AsyncClass"</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>   <span># -&gt; def f() -&gt; "SyncClass": ...</span>
<span>typing</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncIterator</span>            <span># -&gt; typing.Iterator</span>
<span>typing</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncGenerator</span>           <span># -&gt; typing.Generator</span>
<span>typing</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncIterable</span>            <span># -&gt; typing.Iterable</span>

<span># There are some async statements that don't</span>
<span># have a direct sync counterpart so unasync</span>
<span># can't do anything with them.</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>__await__</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>      <span># -&gt; ???</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After adding support for both sync and async the next step is supporting
multiple async libraries. The libraries commonly used in the Python community
are asyncio, Trio, Twisted, and Curio.</p>

<p>Supporting all of these is a challenge but can be made easier with
the following two libraries:</p>

<h3>Sniffio</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/python-trio/sniffio">Sniffio</a>
is a library that can detect which async library your code is running under.
The package can detect asyncio, Trio, and Curio. By detecting which library is
running you then know which library-specific APIs can be used safely.</p>

<p>This also means you can lazily import ‘trio’ only when Trio is detected as the
current async library. No need to make Trio a direct dependency.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>sniffio</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span># Detect the current async library</span>
    <span>async_lib</span> <span>=</span> <span>sniffio</span><span>.</span><span>current_async_library</span><span>()</span>

    <span># Lazily-load so users don't need 'trio'</span>
    <span># installed to use 'asyncio'.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>async_lib</span> <span>==</span> <span>"asyncio"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
        <span># &lt;asyncio-specific code&gt;</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>async_lib</span> <span>==</span> <span>"trio"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>import</span> <span>trio</span>
        <span># &lt;trio-specific code&gt;</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>RuntimeError</span><span>(</span>
            <span>f</span><span>"Unsupported async library: </span><span>{</span><span>async_lib</span><span>!r}</span><span>"</span>
        <span>)</span>
<span>except</span> <span>sniffio</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncLibraryNotFoundError</span><span>:</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>RuntimeError</span><span>(</span>
        <span>"Couldn't detect async library"</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>from</span> <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A pattern I’ve found useful is to group all library-specific code into one file
each that all have an identical API. That way you can call sniffio’s detection
one time and know which set of APIs should be used for the duration of the program.</p>

<h3>AnyIO</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agronholm/anyio">AnyIO</a>
is a library that provides a single interface that can be used
interchangeably from asyncio, Trio, and Curio programs.</p>

<p>For most projects trying to support multiple async libraries this
should be your first stop.</p>

<p>The interfaces that are provided include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Structured Concurrency Primitives</li>
<li>Synchronization Primitives</li>
<li>Networking (TCP / TLS / UDP)</li>
<li>Asynchronous File I/O</li>
<li>Signals and Threads</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>anyio</span>

<span># Task Groups</span>
<span>async</span> <span>with</span> <span>anyio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task_group</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>group</span><span>:</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>

<span># Networking: TCP, TLS, UDP</span>

<span>await</span> <span>sock</span><span>.</span><span>start_tls</span><span>()</span>

<span>await</span> <span>sock</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>()</span>
<span>await</span> <span>sock</span><span>.</span><span>receive</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>AnyIO also provides its own pytest plugin ‘pytest-anyio’ that makes
writing test cases for multiple async libraries a breeze.</p>

<p>AnyIO uses Sniffio under the hood to detect which async library is being
used and provide the correct implementation.</p>

<p>You can read AnyIO’s documentation for a list of all features and usages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A digital feed is an online stream of content which gets updated as new content is pushed by the feed’s sources. Generally, content is created by users on the social media platform, to be consumed by their followers.</p>
<p>All popular social media platforms feature some type of feed: Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook. Operators of these platforms benefit from increased engagement by their users, so they employ techniques designed to achieve that end. Unfortunately, they often do so at the expense of their users’ well-being. Below are 7 rules to help you retain control over your screen time, without having to leave social media for good, ordered from most important to least important.</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-avoid-non-chronological-feeds">Rule #1: Avoid non-chronological feeds</h2>
<p>On most online platforms, the order of content is determined by an algorithm designed to maximize user engagement, i.e. addict you and keep you looking at ads for as long as possible. Examples: Facebook news feed, Twitter “top tweets”, Instagram explore tab, Tiktok.</p>

<p>Your phone is always within your reach. Access feeds only on your laptop, in order not to condition yourself to constantly check it. Don’t install social media or video apps on your phone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3-follow-with-purpose">Rule #3: Follow with purpose</h2>
<p>Your digital experience changes with each new person/source you follow. Be mindful about the utility of the information you would obtain before following a new source.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4-limit-the-number-of-peoplethings-you-follow">Rule #4: Limit the number of people/things you follow</h2>
<p>The amount of content you will have to go through increases roughly linearly with the number of sources you follow. You probably won’t see everything your 500 followees share—maybe it’s time to unfollow some of them.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5-schedule-and-limit-your-exposure">Rule #5: Schedule and limit your exposure</h2>
<p>Your brain has a limited capacity to process and hold information. Schedule a certain hour of the day to receive it, and don’t surpass it. Example: No more than 30 minutes of social media, restricted to 10–11 am.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6-block-generously-and-ruthlessly">Rule #6: Block generously and ruthlessly</h2>
<p>If you don’t like what you’re seeing, block or unfollow <em>immediately</em>. This is the hardest when someone posts content that is sometimes useful, but otherwise annoying too. Generally, we put up with it for too long until we block someone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-7-mute-words">Rule #7: Mute words</h2>
<p>Avoid toxic memes by muting related words, e.g. Trump, ISIS. This will filter out any post that contains that word. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords">here</a> to do it on Twitter now—it’s easy.</p>
<p>Follow these simple set of rules, and restore your control over social media and your digital experience in no time.</p>

					<p>I made a little something after encountering a clogged up toilet and a hostel cleaner who looked frustrated. Perhaps you never even considered your toilet paper’s destiny… but should you flush the toilet paper? I made a cool flowchart to help you determine whether to bin it or flush it! Follow these easy steps:</p>
<div id="attachment_2187"><p><img title="Should you?" src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png" alt="should I flush the toilet paper travel flowchart world map" width="600" height="1500" srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png 410w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-138x345.png 138w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png" data-lazy-srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png 410w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-138x345.png 138w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart.png 800w"></p><p><em>Want this infographic on your blog/website? Scroll down to find out how!</em></p></div>
<p>But really. Clogged toilets and sewage systems are a huge problem in many parts of the world – and the traveler isn’t helping the cause. I’ve met a few travelers who were proud to announce they would straight up refuse to bin their used toilet paper when there was a sign kindly asking them not to. They thought not flushing it was gross <i title="You know what’s really gross? A toilet that is overflowing with water. A clogged up sewage system that makes you unable to flush a used toilet&nbsp;FOR DAYS. Having to send a person down into the sewer to get rid of the blockage is gross. People who clog up toilets for no good reason but their own comfort are gross. There, I said it."></i> to put it in a bin, and that was that.</p>
<p>Especially in Latin America, there’s written signs in the stalls to kindly ask you to not flush the paper, but not always. Many people think that the absence of a sign means you can flush the paper, but really, it doesn’t. Get into the habit of binning the paper as soon as possible upon arrival to your destination. It’s really just a matter of flipping a switch in your head, but it will go a long way. Being a ‘responsible traveler’ means more than just not disrupting communities, it also means not disrupting people’s (sometimes basic) infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Toilet Paper Flushing World Map</h3>
<p>So you don’t like my flowchart? Well then I went and did the Flying Spaghetti Monster’s work and made a world map using the data of <a href="http://wheredoiputthepaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Where do I put the Paper?</a>&nbsp;to give you an overview. Conclusion: flushing the toilet paper is rare, very rare.</p>
<div id="attachment_2190"><p><img title="Know your shit." src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png" alt="toilet paper flushing world map where do i put the paper" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png 1024w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-345x169.png 345w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png" data-lazy-srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png 1024w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-345x169.png 345w"></p><p><em>I think I finally found a topic for my university thesis…</em></p></div>
<p>The <span><strong>green</strong> </span>countries would have you flush the paper, <span><strong>red</strong> </span>forbid it, in&nbsp;<span><strong>orange</strong> </span>countries it <em><strong>highly </strong></em>depends on where you are and <span><strong>icy blue</strong></span> ones don’t have data. <em>Note that this map is purely based on the info provided by the aforementioned website.</em> If the information is lacking/wrong, you’d have to tell the creator&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattkitson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Kitson</a>&nbsp;too! Also, Matt, we should drink a beer.</p>
<h3>A Little Back Story</h3>
<p>In my 3.5 years of being on the road I’ve spent about 2.5 of them in regions where you don’t flush used paper. Already <a href="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/nomadcruise-arrival-in-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upon arrival</a> in South America, I knew I had to flip that switch in my head. Of about 500 days of travel in South America, I must have spent about 45 days around dysfunctional toilets, of which the far majority was located in some form of tourist accommodation like a hostel where the toilets have to endure a lot of traffic – more than in hotels. In about 90% of hostels is a sign in each stall asking you not to flush the toilet paper. Every time I saw unflushed toilet paper floating in the bowl where it shouldn’t, I was in a hostel.</p>
<p>Once,&nbsp;<em>only once</em>, have I been to a place in Latin America where the stall had a sign on it “PLEASE FLUSH THE TOILET PAPER, DON’T PUT IT IN THE BIN”. That was in a luxury café called <a href="http://www.refugiodenavegantes.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refugio de Navegantes</a> in Dalcahue, <a href="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/chiloe-archipelago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chiloé Archipelago</a>, Chile – far far away not on any particular route. Everything&nbsp;looked a little futuristic. I had to read the sign three times before I understood its message. I was a little shocked. Then I flushed it all.</p>
<p>Then there’s the countries where people wash not wipe. Some of them give you the choice between toilet paper and water (Argentina and Uruguay), others don’t provide paper and expect you to follow suit by washing. I remember childhood trips to France and laughing at the funny thing in the bathroom which my mom explained was a “butt washer”. I never fully grasped the anatomy and function of a bidet until I googled it <em>in fucking 2016</em>.</p>
<p>On a short trip to Morocco in 2012 I encountered my first “hose” (a.k.a. “bum gun”). On my travels through Iran in 2014 I really learned the way of the hose in combo with squat toilets. This time there was really no way around it, but an 8-year-old going to rural France with my parents, I cried every time the only option was a squat toilet. Toilet paper can be a tough find in some places, but I always carry some backup paper with me.</p>
<p>Where I’m from we always flush everything away through our fancy seat-toilets without a care. For 19 years of my life I had never seen a clogged toilet in my Passport Nation. Their toilets are resilient and its&nbsp;flushes are powerful. That was until I started studying, lived in a shared amenities apartment and the yearly carnival&nbsp;happened. Some visitor tried flushing the unflushable and we all had to suffer the consequences. The next day someone came by to fix it.</p>
<p>Back to Latin America, the situation is a lot more fragile over here. I’ve noticed that it takes up a lot of mental space if I can’t just assume I can go to the <em>b</em><em>año&nbsp;</em>anytime I please. The planning involved takes away the ability to relax about a basic bodily function. I know I’ll never take a functioning toilet for granted again.</p>

					<div><p>America was born middle class.</p><p>Before the Revolution, <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-01-02-0052-0002">John Adams</a> condemned extreme wealth concentration: “Property monopolized, or in the Possession of a Few is a Curse to Mankind. We should preserve not an Absolute Equality – this is unnecessary, but preserve all from extreme Poverty, and all others from extravagant Riches.”</p><p>After the Revolution, <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-08-02-0534">Thomas Jefferson</a> condemned extreme inequality: “I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property.”</p><p>The next generation attested to America’s middling status. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/815/815-h/815-h.htm">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> described equality as America’s defining characteristic: “Amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of conditions.”</p><p>Modern research confirms America’s egalitarian origins. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w18396">Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson</a> concluded that on the eve of the Revolution, “New England and the Middle Colonies appear to have been more egalitarian than anywhere else in the measurable world.”</p><p>The virtues of the middle class have been celebrated since Classical Antiquity. In <em>The Suppliants,</em> <a href="https://anacyclosis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EXCERPT-EURIPIDES-SUPPLIANTS-423-BC.pdf">Euripides</a> praised the middle class as the preserver of cities. In <em>The Politics</em>, <a href="https://anacyclosis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EXCERPT-THE-POLITICS-ARISTOTLE-350-BC.pdf">Aristotle</a> described the virtues of the middle class in detail, concluding that “the political community administered by the middle class (<em>hoi mesoi</em>) is the best.” America’s founding ethos embodies the middling virtues of industry, honesty, trust, ruggedness, temperance, equity, and modesty found in the yeoman ideal.</p><p>But the middle class is not only about size or virtue. It is also about power. Liberty is not derived from the theoretical ability to <em>give</em> consent. Liberty is rooted in the actual power to <em>withhold</em> consent. Ancient democracy was based on fear of military labor strikes. American democracy was born of a tax revolt.</p><p>It is thus not enough that the middle class be substantial or virtuous. In order to maintain democracy, the middle class must also be financially <em>independent</em>. Without independence, people must rely on patronage to survive. Wards and dependents cannot strike, sustain revolts, or guarantee redress of grievances. A dependent lower class cannot maintain democracy any more than a kindergarten class. Even an informed citizenry is impotent without independence.</p><p>Modern scholars, particularly <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/levitsky/files/lipset_1959.pdf">Martin Seymour Lipset</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/46/1/114/2228262?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Barrington Moore</a>, have confirmed the connection between democracy and the middle class. Unfortunately, modern scholarship also confirms the decline of the middle class. Neither our government nor researchers have settled on a standard definition of “middle class”. But the <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/about/metrics/gini-index.html">Gini</a> index shows plainly enough that America was more egalitarian in 1776 than it is in 2020. The byproduct of this extreme inequality is extreme precarity. Today, roughly half of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Household precarity, in turn, produces household dependency.</p><p>The crisis of the American middle class accordingly has two dimensions. First is quantitative: the middle class is financially declining. Second is qualitative: the financial and political independence of the middle class erodes as households become more precarious and dependent upon subsidies to make ends meet.</p><p>And all this was before the ongoing Covid19 pandemic devastated the economy. Even before the pandemic, however, the American middle class faced other looming threats, the dimensions of which have not yet been fully apprehended: the impact of job-destroying and labor-saving technology, alongside the proliferation of the gig economy. Add these factors to various conventional grievances such as immigration, outsourcing, debt, inflation, and taxation, and the American middle class is being pummeled from all sides.</p><p>So, how do we restore the middle class?</p><p>Republicans advocate deregulation and tax reform, citing the golden age when America enjoyed seemingly unlimited productivity and job creation. These were great ideas, but for a different time. American corporations are no longer American, but global. They now have foreign supply chains and workforces. Furthermore, they have foreign owners and answer to foreign interests. When unregulated, multinational corporations sell out American workers to the lowest foreign bidder to make an extra dime. <em>Laissez faire</em>&nbsp;isn’t a solution, it’s <em>carte blanche</em> to undercut American workers. The last fifty years of unrestrained capitalism is transforming America into a place that resembles the stratified aristocracies of old Europe more than the hopeful egalitarian Republic which our Founding Fathers established.</p><p>Democrats advocate progressive taxation combined with various subsidies to provide immediate relief to struggling households. These are also great ideas, but only for a short time. While subsidies mitigate household precarity, they also aggravate household dependency and undermine productivity. This is not just theory. History’s only other superpower republic – Ancient Rome – never regained its middle class after making its grain dole permanent. Even though <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/tiberius.html">Tiberius Gracchus</a> got many smallhold farmers back on the land, many did not take so well to hard work. Rome learned the hard way that you cannot restore a productive and independent middle class with subsidies, and that the middling virtues are not quickly revived.</p><p>Despite Rome’s example, however, no truly democratic people want to be precarious or dependent upon subsidies. While anyone in a free country may need a helping hand from time to time, no one saved from rough seas wants to carry their life raft around with them forever.</p><p>Therefore, rather than “trickle-down” or “bottom-up” economics, if what we care about is the&nbsp;<em>middle</em>&nbsp;class, shouldn’t we benchmark the economy against the&nbsp;<em>median</em>?</p><p>To accomplish this, we could tether the outcomes of the top households to those of the median households. Going forward, we could – with a slight adjustment to the tax code – cap household net worth at some reasonable multiple of the median net worth (but not tax existing wealth). Thereafter, the very top would enjoy further financial gain only when the median gains. The rationale for this is that when the top is anchored to the median, all energies of pecuniary minds must refocus on the common goal of increasing the median. This approach would align the interests of the billionaire class to the middle class.</p><p>Assuming the largest fortune in 1776 was roughly 1,000x the median household net worth (my own rough extrapolation, this number needs to be confirmed) a multiple of 10,000x (roughly $1 billion today) seems a reasonable place to start the discussion. There are of course arguments for a higher ratio. There are also arguments for a lower ratio. What do you think the ratio should be?</p><p>In restoring the middle class and social mobility, this approach would be more universal and effective in the long-term than a thousand socialist band-aids. Unlike policies which target only one aspect of economic activity, a policy benchmarked against the median household net worth cannot be evaded or manipulated because the calculation of net worth factors the cumulative effects of all economic activity. Every pay cut, tax hike, price increase, hidden cost, layoff, job outsourced, debt, foreclosure, benefit reduction, pay disparity, and machine and algorithm which reduces the wages of a flesh-and-blood American worker – in other words, all forces depressing the median – are computed by the median net worth.</p><p>By contrast, any policy that targets only one of these factors, for example a policy to establish a minimum wage, does nothing to address any of the other factors noted above like taxes. $15.00 an hour does not protect workers from benefit reductions, outsourcing, immigrants, or job-destroying technology. Deploying corporate managers to increase the median household net worth does.</p><p>To avoid further dependency on subsidies, we could use the proceeds of this new tax (which we could name the <em>Patriot Tax</em>) only for appropriations which inure only to the general interest and to no special interest; <em>e.g.</em> veterans’ benefits, infrastructure, national security, social security.</p><p>Enforced with discipline, this approach would rehabilitate an independent middle class, restore by law the modesty and moderation that once prevailed by custom, and promote America’s independence. All with no new subsidies, corporate taxes, or business regulations. It will not happen overnight, but neither Rome nor America was built in a day.</p><p>To restore our independent middle class, we cannot trust to unfettered capitalism or indefinite socialism. We must acknowledge that the fleecing of the American middle class over the past half century – under both parties – has left millions precarious, dependent, and in need in immediate relief. But if we value authenticity in our democracy, productivity in our citizens, and independence for our nation, we must tame both socialism and capitalism with a new and sustainable theory of political economy. Because it advocates the enforcement of ratios to prescribed economic activity, may call this new theory <em>Rationism</em>.</p><p><em>Notice: this piece outlines the first policy concept informed by the Anacyclosis Institute’s research.

<p><span>Initial publication: June 27, 2020</span></p><hr>

<p>
	I've <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previously discussed</a> how the PlayStation 2 doesn't have any good entry-point software exploits for launching homebrew. You need to either purchase a memory card with an exploit pre-installed (or a memory card to USB adapter), a HDD expansion bay (not available to slim consoles), open up the console to block the disc tray sensors, or install a modchip. For the best selling console of all time, it deserves better hacks.
</p>

<p>
	My initial attempt to solve this problem was to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">exploit the BASIC interpreter</a> that came bundeld with early PAL region PS2s. Although I was successful at producing the first software based entry-point exploit that can be triggered using only hardware that came with the console, the attack was largely criticized due to the requirement of having to enter the payload manually through the controller or keyboard, and limitation of being PAL only. I decided to write-off that exploit as being impractical, and so the hunt continued for a better attack scenario for the PlayStation 2.
</p>

<p>
	The PlayStation 2 has other sources of untrusted input that we could attack; games which support online multiplayer or USB storage could almost definitely be exploited. But unlike say the Nintendo 64, where we don't really have any other choice but to resort to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/shogihax.html">exploiting games over interfaces like modems</a>, the PlayStation 2 has one key difference: its primary input is optical media (CD / DVD discs), a format which anyone can easily burn with readily available consumer hardware. This leaves an interesting question which I've wanted to solve since I was a child:
</p>

<p>
	Is it possible to just burn our own homebrew games and launch them on an unmodified console the same way we would launch official discs (without going through any user interaction like disc swapping or triggering a network exploit in a game)?
</p>



<p>
	Ultimately, I was successfully able to achieve my goal by exploiting the console's DVD player functionality. This blog post will describe the technical details and process of reversing and exploiting the DVD player. Loading <a href="#backup">backups of commercial games is also possible</a>. All of my code is <a href="https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot">available on GitHub</a>.

</p>

<br>

<h2>DVD video player attack surface</h2>
<p>
	Obviously we can't just burn a disc containing an ELF file and expect the PS2 to boot it; we'll need to exploit some kind of software vulnerability related to parsing of controlled data. The console supports playing burned DVD video discs, which exposes significant attack surface we could potentially exploit to achieve our goal.
</p>

<p>
	If we think about what a DVD Video consists of there are quite a few main components, each with the potential for vulnerabilities:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>UDF filesystem</li>
	<li>DVD Video metadata / subtitles</li>
	<li>Audio and video decoding</li>
	<li>Interaction machine</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Whilst the complete DVD Video specification is unfortunately behind a paywall, it is comprised largely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Video_data">open formats like MPEG</a>, just bundled together in a proprietary container format (VOB). For the proprietary aspects there are some freely accessible unofficial references.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format is probably the simplest format used, and is responsible for storing the metadata that links the video files together.
</p>

<p>
	The interaction machine is what allows for interactive menus and games in DVD Videos. It has <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Inside_DVD-Video/Instruction_Set_Details">32 groups of instructions</a>, and is interesting because it could potentially be used to dynamically manipulate internal memory state to prime an exploit, or it could be used to create a universal DVD with a menu which allows you to select your firmware version and trigger the appropriate exploit.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
	Clearly it's not practical to do most of our testing on the real hardware since burning hundreds of test discs would be wasteful and time inefficient. We need an emulator with some debugger support, which is where we hit our first roadblock: the most popular emulator for PlayStation 2, PCSX2, <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/1981">does not support playing DVD Videos</a>, and no one is interested in adding support.
</p>

<p>
	I'd like to thank krHacken for helping me out with that first roadblock. It turns out that PCSX2 does support the DVD player; it just can't load it automatically since it's located in encrypted storage and PCSX2 does not support the decryption. There are public tools which can <a href="https://github.com/xfwcfw/kelftool">decrypt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimmikaelkael/eromdir">extract</a> the DVD player from EROM storage. It can then be repacked into an ELF for easy loading into PCSX2.
</p>

<p>
	Due to the large number of different PlayStation 2 models released, each with slightly different DVD player firmwares (&gt; 50...), I will focus on a single DVD player for the duration of this article: 3.10E (configured with English language in PS2 settings), as it happens to be the firmware for the console I own. Update: apparently the 3.10E exploit described here works on 3.10U console with no changes.
</p>

<p>
	I will continue to use Ghidra for decompilation as I've been using throughout my <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previous</a> articles. The DVD player does not contain any symbols so all names in code snippets were assigned by me through reverse engineering.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Disc controlled data</h2>
<p>
	The first file a DVD player will attempt to read is <code>VIDEO_TS.IFO</code>. Searching memory for contents of the file and then setting memory write breakpoints there to track back where it was written we quickly locate the API that reads disc contents used by the IFO parsing code, <code>getDiscByte</code> at <code>0x25c920</code>. It's a stream reader which caches a number of sectors into a RAM buffer, and then automatically seeks more data once needed:
</p>

<pre><code>byte getDiscByte(void) {
	byte ret;
	
	if (currentDiscBytePointer &lt; endDiscBytePointer) {
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	else {
		currentDiscBytePointer = &amp;buffer;
		setOffset = setOffset + numberOfSectorsRead;
		getDiscByteInternal();
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	currentDiscBytePointer = currentDiscBytePointer + 1;
	return ret;
}
</code></pre>



<p>
	From searching calls to this, we can also quickly find wrappers that fetch data of larger sizes: <code>getDiscU16</code> (<code>0x25c980</code>), <code>getDiscU32</code> (<code>0x25c9b8</code>), and <code>getDiscData</code> (<code>0x25c9f0</code>), which is the most interesting as it reads an arbitrary length of data:
</p>

<pre><code>void getDiscData(uint size, byte *destination) {
	byte b;
	uint i;
	
	i = 0;
	if (size != 0) {
		do {
			i = i + 1;
			b = getDiscByte();
			*destination = b;
			destination = destination + 1;
		} while (i &lt; size);
	}
	return;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Large reads</h2>
<p>
	The first thing I did was search for calls to <code>getDiscData</code> in the hope of finding one with controllable size, and no bounds checking.
</p>

<p>
	Sure enough, we very quickly identify about 4 blatant buffer overflow vulnerabilities of this nature. Relating back to the <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format, we can see that there are numerous 16-bit array lengths which are needed to parse the variably sized data structures in the file. The DVD player mistakenly only ever expects the maximum lengths allowed by the DVD specification, and so it is missing checks to reject discs with larger lengths. Since all of the copies are done on statically allocated memory buffers, specifying larger than allowed lengths will cause buffer overflows. For example, below is decompilation for the one at <code>0x25b3bc</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>		large1 = getDiscU16();
		large2 = getDiscU16();
		large3 = getDiscU16();
		ignored = getDiscU16();
		getDiscData(((uint)large1 + (uint)large2 + (uint)large3) * 8, &amp;DAT_0140bdd4);</code></pre>



<p>
	This one is the most interesting because it allows the largest possible copy size (<code>0xffff * 3 * 8 = 0x17FFE8</code> bytes) of all the <code>getDiscData</code> buffer overflows. It copies into the statically allocated buffer at <code>0x0140bdd4</code>, and so by specifying the maximum possible copy size we gain control over the address space from <code>0x140bdd4</code> to <code>0x158BDBC</code> (<code>0x140bdd4 + 0x17FFE8</code>).
</p>

<br>

<h2>Corruption from the large reads</h2>
<p>
	As you can see, we can control quite a large region of memory using the above vulnerability. However, scanning through that memory is initially very disappointing; there are very few pointers, and none of them look particularly interesting to corrupt!
</p>

<p>
	Although there are no interesting pointers in this region, there are some indexes, which if corrupted could lead to further out of bounds memory corruption.
</p>

<p>
	Note that large reads like this won't always copy contiguous data from the IFO file, as sectors will start repeating once we exceed the file size, but generally assume that all data written by a <code>getDiscData</code> call can be controlled as it originates from <i>somewhere</i> on the disc. Also, after writing a certain amount, we may overflow into internal state used by <code>getDiscByte</code> functions, but we will get to this later.
</p>

<br>

<h3>OOB call</h3>
<p>
	At <code>0x25e388</code> we have this call to an entry in a function pointer array, where we can control the 16-bit <code>fpIndex</code> at <code>0x141284a</code> from the overflow:
</p>

<pre><code>(*(code *)(&amp;PTR_LAB_005b9d40)[(uint)fpIndex])(puVar6 + ((uint)DAT_01412841 - 1) * 8);</code></pre>



<p>
	This allows us to jump to the address stored anywhere from <code>0x5b9d40</code> up to <code>0x5b9d40 + 0xffff * 4 = 0x5F9D3C</code>.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Exploiting OOB call</h4>
<p>
	This primitive is not quite ideal, as none of our overflow bugs allow us to control the memory where the jump targets are read from. Worse still, most of this memory region is mapped from a read-only section of the DVD Player, so it's unlikely that we can influence the contents of this memory region without another bug.
</p>

<p>
	After the function pointers, we do some see some addresses for <code>switch</code> <code>case</code> labels, which is slightly interesting because that allows us to jump into the middle of a function and execute its epilogue without having executed its prologue, allowing us to misalign the stack pointer and return to an unexpected value on the stack. I went through all of these and unfortunately I was only ever able to use that to jump to <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Finally after the code pointers, we see read only string data. Interestingly, this data can be changed by switching languages in the PS2 menu, which gives greater hope for finding at least 1 usable jump target in every firmware version, however it unfortunately comes at the cost of forcing the user to reconfigure their language.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Cache-oblivious algorithms seemed incredible to me when I first heard about it in 6.854 (Advanced Algorithms). It’s relatively straightforward to imagine algorithms that utilizes information about page size $B$ and cache size $M$ to create efficient data structures. However, cache-oblivious algorithms are algorithms that achieve similar efficiencies <em>without knowing $B$ or $M$</em>. That means the same cache-oblivious algorithm can be ran on computers with different cache or page sizes and still achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as one that is tailored to that specific cache. The key to many of these algorithms is a recursive, fractal-like idea. I’ll describe a cache-oblivious algorithm for searching in a list of integers.</p>

<p>Here’s the set up. (TLDR at bottom) A program executes on the processor, but the input data resides on the disk. We can think of a disk as a really long linear array of data, but accessing it is really expensive. So, we instead invent this notion of a cache - a layer of memory of $M$ bits that is much smaller, but a lot faster to read/write to. For performance reasons, we will divide the disk and cache into blocks of $B$ bits, called pages, and we will transfer data between cache and disk a page at a time.</p>
<p>This cache sits between the processor and the disk, and the processor will never directly read or write to the disk. When the processor wants to read a piece of data that is not on the cache (this is called a cache miss), it will trigger some mechanism that copies the relevant page from the disk to the cache first, <em>evicting another page if the cache is full</em>, and then read from the cache.</p>
<p>How might this help? Well, trivially, if the entire set of data that the program needs fits in the cache, conceivably the processor could have fetched it all in the cache, paid the one-off cost, and then for the rest of the program the processor will never have to pay the expensive cost of reading from disk. Of course most programs require more data than that, and so we want to design algorithms that minimize cache misses.</p>
<h2 id="cache-management">Cache management</h2>
<p>However, the way computers are set up restricts the tools we have to achieve this. Programs executing on the processor have no explicit control over the cache. Instead, conceptually, programs continue to send read and write requests to the disk as though there is no cache. The processor intercepts these requests, and performs the necessary cache operations to serve the information. In other words, the cache is transparent to programs.  Thus, the task of reducing cache misses decomposes into two orthogonal components: writing efficient algorithms by cleverly ordering or specifying memory accesses, and efficient cache management.</p>
<p>For example, an efficient algorithm might try to shuffle memory accesses around so that memory accesses to a particular memory address are clumped together, increasing the likelihood that there will be a cache hit. In fact, because of the paging system, it would doubly help if memory accesses to the same <em>spatial region</em> are clumped together, because there’s a chance they’ll be on the same page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efficient cache management entails trying to predict which piece of data to evict from the cache when there is a cache miss and we want to load more data into an already full cache. Since we’re focusing on the algorithm this article, we assume that the cache manager has magic oracle powers that lets it discard <em>optimally</em>, so from the algorithm design standpoint, if there exists a sequence of cache loads/writes that achieves our desired performance, we assume that the cache manager will do it. It turns out that this is not unreasonable, because simple techniques such as the Least Recently Used algorithm work <em>really</em> well. (An exposition on this deserves its own article.)</p>
<p>To summarize, the components of the external memory model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk, effectively unbounded in size, stores data in pages of size $B$</li>
<li>Cache, stores $M/B$ pages, each page has size $B$</li>
<li>Processor executes algorithm, also manages cache.</li>
<li>Algorithm runs on the processor. When data is needed, the processor transparently loads the required page into the cache if there’s a cache miss, or serve the cached data if there isn’t</li>
</ul>
<p>There are efficient algorithms that require explicit knowledge of $B$ and $M$, and there cache-oblivous algorithms that are just as efficient, but some how do not. That is to say, the algorithm performs the same actions and requests the same sequence of memory accesses, that works efficiently no matter what size $B$ and $M$ really are. We’ll take a close look at the latter here.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to scan through a list of $N$ integers, to do some task, say finding the maximum. If the list occupy a contiguous block of memory on the disk, this can be done efficiently by loading pages one at a time, and scanning through the page before loading the next page. This thus takes $O(N/B)$ disk accesses, and is quite clearly optimal.</p>
<p>Suppose the algorithm does not know $B$. It can achieve the same efficiency by simply reading the elements of the list in order. The CPU will then fetch the first page to the cache, containing elements $0$ to $B-1$ and pass it to the program, and then when the program requires element $B$, it’ll read in the next page, which contains elements $B$ to $2B-1$, possibly overwriting the earlier page. This will just continue until all $N/B$ pages are read. This is cache-oblivious, because the algorithm of sequentially reading the elements is the same regardless of what $B$ is.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, it is essential that the list is stored in a contiguous block of memory. Had the elements been scattered around like in a linked-list, each access could potentially trigger a cache miss, since there’s no guarantee that neighboring elements will be on the same page. This may seem obvious, but this is the main mechanism by which we can write efficient algorithms - coming up with efficient layouts of data.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the problem of searching for an integer in a list. We’ll examine three ways of doing this.</p>
<h2 id="inefficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-binary-search">Inefficient cache-oblivious algorithm: Binary search</h2>
<p>Let’s assume the data is sorted in a list, and packed contiguously on the disk. A possible algorithm is then to perform binary search, which typically takes $O(\log N)$ reads. The binary search can be viewed a successively narrowing an interval in which the query value may reside in. However, once the interval that the binary search is narrowing is $O(B)$, the entire interval may reside in a page, and no further page accesses are required. Thus, we require only $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. Notice that this is a cache-oblivious algorithm because the algorithm doesn’t know what $B$ is - to the algorithm, it’s just running a standard binary search.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-but-not-cache-oblivious-b-trees">Efficient, but not cache-oblivious: B-trees</h2>
<p>Suppose we know $B$ ahead of time. We can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses. We arrange the list in the format of a B-tree, a generalized BST. Similar to a BST, each subtree of a B-tree corresponds to a contiguous subset of the elements of the list when sorted by value. However, each node $V$ of the tree contains not one, but $B$ elements, which splits the interval corresponding to the subtree rooted at node $V$ into not 2, but $B+1$ intervals. Then, we can traverse down the BST, and each time we go down one level we reduce the interval by a factor of $B$. This thus requires only $O(\log_B N) = O(\log N / \log B)$ page accesses. In reality of course, we have to store pointers and possibly other metadata in each node, so we can’t have exactly $B$ elements in each node, but we can definitely split by $\Theta(B)$ each level.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-van-emde-boas-layout">Efficient cache-oblivious algorithm: van Emde Boas layout</h2>
<p>Now we come to the exciting part. We claim that we can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses, but without having to know $B$ ahead of time. The data structure we’re using is a good old balanced Binary Search Tree. However, the order in which we store the nodes in memory matters. If we pack the the BST in a regular fashion, say in breadth-first order, we could potentially have a situation where almost every vertex in a BST search path, except for the first few, lies in a different page, and thus we’ll have to use $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. The van Embde Boas layout is basically a clever way of ordering the vertices of a binary search tree in a recursive, fractal-like manner such that each page access will fetch the next few vertices that will be queried, so that the next few accesses will be contained within that page.</p>

</figure>

<p>For convenience, suppose the binary tree is complete and has height $H=2^K$. The layout is a permutation of the vertices of the binary tree. Denote $T(x, k)$ as the subtree of height $2^k$, rooted at vertex $x$. If the subtree at $x$ is deeper than $2^k$, then $T(x,k)$ will be the subtree truncated to the required depth. Denote $L(x, k)$ as the layout for that subtree. Then, for some root vertex $x$, of a (sub-)tree with height $h=2^k$, $L(x, k)$ is defined recursively as:</p>
<p>$$L(x, k) = L(x, k-1) \circ L(l_1, k-1) \circ L(l_2, k-1) \circ \dots \circ L(l_{n}, k-1)$$</p>
<p>Where, $l_1, \dots, l_{n}$ are the $n=2^{h/2}$ children of the leaves of $T(x, k-1)$, and $\circ$ is just concatenation. One application of this recursion is shown above.</p>
<h3 id="visual-sketch">Visual sketch</h3>
<p>If you didn’t catch that, don’t worry about it. Here’s a walkthrough. Suppose we’re given a complete binary tree of height $h=2^k$, rooted at $x$. We want to compute $L(x, k)$, which is a permutation of the vertices in this binary tree. Here’s how it’s done:</p>

<li>Cut all the edges between the $2^{k-1}$-th and $2^{k-1}+1$-th layer. This gives us:

                    <p>Doing an internship while working from home? The dream of many students is the bane of remote companies. Internships are a great way to get some more helping hands, while also creating growth and learning opportunities for people who need it. Especially as you, as a remote company, have the ability to give opportunities to <em>anyone</em>, it's definitely something you should look into. How remote companies can structure and create remote internship positions.</p>
<h2>Finding remote interns</h2>
<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed when thinking of all the difficulties and hurdles that <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/hiring-for-remote-positions/">hiring a remote intern</a> could bring with it. The more important that we don't lose our heads and plan for a large pool of potential applications. What seems like a nice problem to have can become overwhelming really fast.</p>
<p>As a remote company, it's not practical to try and get interns from a local university or similar. Instead, you should see if you can leverage <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/where-to-post-your-remote-job-postings/">leading job boards</a> like <a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a> and <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">WWR</a> to get the word out there. This will lead to a larger and more diverse pool of applicants.</p>
<p>As a remote company, you also have more power to give chances to people that would traditionally not get a chance to enter the industry. A good idea is to work together with <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">communities that are serving underrepresented people</a> in tech and see whether you can work on a location independent internship scheme.</p>
<p>While internships are traditionally something for college students or new grads, it's no shame to see whether you can help career changers or other people from different backgrounds breaking into the industry. As a remote company, you are looking for responsible and self-directed people, which is something that is often built with experience in life and career. Don't shy away from the 'underdogs'.</p>
<p>The gist is, a Stanford grad can get an internship anywhere, so can a student from MIT. As a remote company, a lot of people will want to get an internship that allows you to 'work from home'. It's important to look through the haystack and not shy away from gems, even if they don't fit the traditional internship criteria of FAANG or the Bay Area.</p>
<h2>Selection criteria for remote internships</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, you need&nbsp;<strong>independent, self-starting</strong> people in a remote team, and internships are no different to that. While a talented college student may have these attributes as well, they are often something that develops with experience and time. If you are looking at an application, don't dismiss people with uncommon backgrounds – they often have the experience and expertise to work on something without handholding.</p>
<p>Any intern should still have access to a mentor and receive advice when needed, it's, therefore, better to hire in certain timezone clusters – namely near a mentor with a maximum of +- 4 hours, so at least a half-day of overlap can be arranged. That limits your application pool a lot, depending on where your mentors are located, which can be a good thing if you are totally overwhelmed with applications.</p>
<p>With international school systems and even different national schools running different forms of exams and grading, school grades are usually not something you should look at when it comes to evaluating an intern. If you have a small selection of people,&nbsp;<strong>references</strong> are what you would want to look at instead. Be it from professors, former bosses, coworkers or even people in the larger network – getting a second opinion can be very valuable here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are used to only looking at bullet point CVs, you will very quickly realize that there is not much value in those anymore. With interns, you are getting a lot more value from cover letters, questions or even challenges, than you'd get from a CV. A CV is important for context, but the cover letter is what's going to tell you about the person.&nbsp;<strong>Emphasize</strong> the importance of those, as you'll otherwise see different cultures handle the cover letter process differently.</p>
<p>You should also mention and customize your selection process in the case that you are looking at the possibility of full-time employment after. A transition to FTE is not only attractive to applicants, but also a great evaluation time for you to see whether someone is a fit. Again, with candidates that you'd usually not consider, this is a great chance to allow them a foot in the door.</p>
<h2>Onboarding remote interns</h2>
<p>So, you've hired your first intern! That's great, but now the real work begins. <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/onboarding-remote-employees/">Onboarding in a remote team</a> is extremely importand and the first week of an internship is crucial. Depending on your hire, it's their first dip into a career, working life, remote life or a new industry. That's huge, and also anxiety-inducing!</p>
<p>Be sure to have a checklist ready on day number one. It's even better if an intern can do their first few tasks as self service, before the mentor is ready to catch up. You can try something like <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a> to share tasks beforehand. It's good practice to have review calls at the end of the first few days with a mentor, to be sure all concerns can be handled properly.</p>
<p>The first week should stand for exploration and getting comfortable with internal workflows. Especially if it's one of their first internships in that industry, a lot of things that can seem trivial will be not as self-explanatory as a think. As a result of that, you should plan a lot more mentorship resources at the beginning of an internship, as you may think.</p>
<p>Before you start with an internship project, it can be a good idea to do something easier instead. That might be <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/why-every-remote-worker-should-be-a-writer/">writing a short article</a>, documenting the onboarding process, fixing a little bug in the code or creating a simple design, anything is up for grabs.</p>
<p>By the end of the first week, you should set eyes on the actual project that the intern is going to work on. There are a lot of best practises for internship projects which aren't exclusive to remote work, but having something that doesn't need to much input from other teams is even more suitable here: It leads to shorter communication cycles and a better end result if the intern is able to concentrate on their core exercises and communication, instead of trying to lift blockers.</p>
<h2>Supervision and mentorship of remote interns</h2>
<p>Mentors are always hard to find, so be sure to have a waterproof mentorship program for your interns. Set goals beforehand, prepare a great project, set up a timeline and agree on a set of milestones.</p>
<p>A mentor isn't supposed to feed solutions to interns, but instead is the connecting point between interns and the rest of the team. Interns may have slightly obvious questions, and a mentor is there to guide them towards finding the solutions for those. A mentor is also a point of contact for concerns and issues. Interns may have difficulties finding their way into different teams, and a mentor can help them with guiding towards the right point.</p>
<p>A key cornerstone of a successful mentorship should be a <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/guide-to-1-on-1-meetings-in-remote-teams/">regularly scheduled 1-on-1 call</a> between intern and mentee. This usually happens on a daily or bi-daily basis during the first few weeks and can be scheduled for once per week in the later stages of the internship. During the 1-on-1, it's good to keep an agenda to go through the most important parts of the internship:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall feeling</li>
<li>Current status of the project</li>
<li>Blockers and difficulties</li>
<li>New insights</li>
<li>Plan for the next week</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from that, it's a good idea to include interns in regular team discussions. Even though they might not regularly be able to contribute, it's still a good sign to include interns in discussions and give them the same voice as regular employees. It also helps the team form an image of the abilities of each intern.</p>
<p>If interns are regularly collaborating with other members of the teams, try to collect feedback every month or so and compile a review with things that went well, and things that can be improved to help interns shape their abilities in communication to become better team players.</p>
<p>Overall, it's important not to forget about interns. Even if they are working self-directed, it's extra important to see what they like, dislike, which skills they are picking up and how they are collaborating with others. That may not be a full-time job for a mentor, but takes a good chunk of time out of every week.</p>
<h2>How to evaluate remote interns</h2>
<p>An internship usually lasts 3 - 6 months, depending on the time and plans of an intern. At the end of that, it's good to evaluate interns and their time at the company, to make a mental note, but also give final feedback and reference letter to the intern.</p>
<p>There are certain aspects that you can look at here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did the internship project pan out?</li>
<li>What has been the feedback from the team over the months?</li>
<li>How was the mentor's/supervisor's feeling?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the intern is going back to school or has agreed to take another position, this evaluation can end up in an HR file. If the intern is available for hire, this may end in a hiring decision that the mentor can take with the department heads.</p>
<p>Internships are a great way for young people to break into an industry of their choice. As a remote company, you are in the best position to look for unique and diverse interns from a variety of backgrounds, instead of only taking summer interns of the local universities. Due to the nature of remote, it's also important to keep interns under control, while also leaving them their space to grow. In the end, a good internship program may be the path to a better talent pipeline for your company.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        

      

<div><div><pre><code>NOTE: This is for informational purposes only. This does
not account for all costs of operating. This document
should be used to assist in understanding how to calculate
the cost of deploying this service, not to make budgetary
decisions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This page outlines how you might estimate the cost of deploying the reference
server for your application. Cost estimates assume the use of Google Cloud,
deployment and use within the US, and uses the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/pricing">published pricing rates</a> to arrivea at the
estimation. This could be repeated for other regions as well as for other
cloud providers. Please note that for much of this simplifications have been
made. Due to a majority of the expected costs to be incurred due to storage
serving.</p>


<p>There are a number of variables that need to be figured out to determine cost.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that we are calculating the cost of operating for an area with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A population of 10 Million (10,000,000) people.</li>
  <li>An exposure window of 14 days</li>
  <li>50% adoption of an exposure notifications system</li>
  <li>1,250 new cases daily (approximately .01% new cases per day)</li>
</ul>

<p>From which we can derive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each new set of keys is 448 bytes (14 days * 32 bytes)</li>
  <li>Each daily batch is 1,250 * 448 bytes = .56 MB</li>
  <li>That file is downloaded 5 Million times per day, for (2.8 TB/day downloaded),
84 TB monthly.</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to pricing varying by region, and much of this being scalable, we avoid
speaking about exact pricing for most of it, instead trying to quantify the
magnitude.</p>

<p>To have an idea of the deployment size, this document assumes the defaults
configured for Terraform in
<a href="https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-server/blob/master/terraform/vars.tf">vars.tf</a>.</p>

<p>The largest cost is likely to be in Network Egress. In this calculation we
assume that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cdn">Google Cloud CDN</a> is not used but
instead a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud Storage</a> bucket is
read directly. Please note that using Google Cloud CDN will likely result in
lower cost.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-run-costs">Cloud Run Costs</h2>
<p>https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing</p>

<p>There are multiple containers needed for a complete deployment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Export Cleanup</li>
  <li>Exposure Cleanup</li>
  <li>Export</li>
  <li>Exposure</li>
  <li>Federation In</li>
  <li>Federation Out</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the services run periodically, not constantly. For this reason it is
likely no higher than 6 containers at this scale. Likely, estimating as if 3-4
of these containers would get a reasonable upper limit. The resource limits of
a container are specified in the
<a href="https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-server/blob/master/terraform/service_federationin.tf#L63">terraform resource limits</a>
as 2 CPU and 1G memory per container.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $500 - $750</strong></p>

<h2 id="sql-database-costs">SQL Database Costs</h2>
<p>https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing</p>

<p>The default size for SQL Database is configured to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8 vCPU</li>
  <li>30720 MB Memory</li>
  <li>256 GB SSD</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost of this component can vary greatly on the scale is configured to.
Depending on the needed scale of your deployment this could require a different
configuration.</p>

<p>For instance, while the default is <code>db-custom-8-30720</code>, the documentation
mentions that a <code>db-custom-1-3840</code> instance is likely sufficeint for local
development work. This instance should cost around an eighth of the amount.</p>

<p><strong>Project Monthly Cost: $1000 - $1250</strong></p>

<h2 id="storage-costs">Storage Costs</h2>
<p>https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing</p>

<h3 id="data-storage-cost">Data Storage Cost</h3>
<p>The last 14 days of batches are stored with older batches being deleted. This
is a small amount of data storage. 14 days of batches should be around 8 MB.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $0 - $10</strong></p>

<h3 id="network-usage-cost">Network Usage Cost</h3>
<p>Each user will download one of the daily batch files. This is a highly variable
cost based on adoption. With sufficient users this could easily be in the tens
of thousands of dollars. Also, network egress varies depending on the region.
Please see the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#network-egress">pricing</a>
for network usage to determine a more accurate estimate for your use case.</p>

<p>Copied from above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each new set of keys is 448 bytes (14 days * 32 bytes)</li>
  <li>Each daily batch is 1,250 * 448 bytes = .56 MB</li>
  <li>That file is downloaded 5 Million times per day, for (2.8 TB/day downloaded),
84 TB monthly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $10,000+</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>NOTE: Using the Google Cloud CDN is likely less expensive.
Serving costs when using Google Cloud Storage directly are
higher, often by more than 30%, than Google Cloud CDN.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="operations-cost">Operations Cost</h3>
<p>There are two tiers of operations.</p>

<h4 id="class-a">Class A</h4>
<p>$0.05 per 10,000 operations</p>

<p>Relevant operations from this include <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>LIST</code>. These
will occur as part of batching of exposure keys. These operations will likely
remain under 10,000 for storage as creation of files is batched.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $0 - $20</strong></p>

<h4 id="class-b">Class B</h4>
<p>$0.004 per 10,000 operations</p>

<p>Relevant operations from this include <code>GET</code> requests for key batches.</p>

<p>For each user, there will be a minimum of one <code>GET</code> operation per day.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $50 - $100</strong></p>

				<div><p>Bank of Canada research has established that there is a public good aspect to privacy in payments (Garratt and van Oordt 2019). This note outlines what is technologically feasible for privacy in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) system. Privacy in a CBDC goes beyond binary choices of anonymity or full disclosure. System designers have a range of choices around the type of information to keep private and who to keep it private from. Because privacy is not in the sole purview of the Bank, defining it requires consultation with external parties. Our approach in this note is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop a framework to evaluate different privacy models</li>
<li>understand the technical tools to enact various privacy models</li>
<li>suggest a design approach for CBDC privacy</li>
<li>list the key risks and trade-offs</li>
</ul>
</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div><h2>Key messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are many cryptographic techniques and operational arrangements for a fine-grained privacy design. These demand knowledge of the detailed requirements around privacy and disclosure.</li>
<li>The Bank could engineer a CBDC system with higher levels of privacy than commercial products can offer—but with trade-offs. Some combinations of requirements will not be feasible or may lead to high operational costs and excessive complexity and risk. Also, the user’s overall privacy will depend on factors such as user behaviour and the privacy policies of other entities in the CBDC ecosystem.</li>
<li>Techniques to achieve cash-like privacy are immature. They have limited deployments, none of which comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti–money laundering (AML) regulations. Their risks include hidden vulnerabilities, a lack of scalability and complicated operations.</li>
<li>Maintaining privacy and complying with regulations (the latter which requires disclosure of information) present a dichotomy for a CBDC. This is further complicated by the need for proactive disclosure to prevent fraud.</li>
<li>Public trust in the privacy design the Bank enacts could be enhanced through third-party reviews of CBDC architecture and operations.</li>
</ul>
</div>

				<div><h2>Analysis of system privacy</h2>
<h3>Diverse payment systems with a range of privacy offerings</h3>
<p>The technologies that are or could be used in payment systems are diverse—ranging from cash and debit and credit cards to public and private distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), centralized systems and offline devices. The privacy available to users varies markedly from system to system. For example, most users appreciate that, broadly speaking, cash use is highly private while credit cards offer less privacy. We aim to more precisely categorize this variation in privacy between systems.</p>
<h3>A framework to analyze, compare and define CBDC system requirements</h3>
<p>We consider a CBDC system consisting of holdings and transactions, where a holding has an owner (O) and a balance (B), and a transaction has a payer (Pr), payee (Pe) and amount (A). Privacy is the degree to which holdings and transactions data are hidden from participating entities. The entities are many—the payer’s bank or money services business (MSB), the payee’s MSB, government institutions, payment providers and the general public—each with a varying degree of visibility to holdings and transactions. We present a framework where the privacy profile of a system is a combination of the extent to which details are kept private from each entity. This formulation allows us to compare privacy profiles of diverse technologies.</p>
<p>We summarize the privacy levels of the following representative technologies in <a href="#table1">Table&nbsp;1</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>magnetic stripe credit cards</li>
<li>EMV<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1" title="EMV originally stood for Europay, Mastercard and Visa, the three companies that created the standard. The standard is now managed by EMVCo, a consortium with control split equally among Visa, Mastercard, JCB, American Express, UnionPay and Discover." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1">1</a> chip credit cards</li>
<li>electronic transfers</li>
<li>debit cards</li>
<li>permissioned DLT</li>
<li>custodial and advanced use of public DLTs (e.g., Bitcoin)</li>
<li>tiered ledger systems composed of multiple different ledgers</li>
<li>device-based systems using devices assigned either to identified customers as per KYC regulations or to anonymous customers</li>
<li>cash</li>
</ul>
<p>Offline device-based systems (such as PUF Cash, a system based on physically uncloneable functions [see Calhoun et al. 2019]) come closest to achieving cash-like privacy.</p>

				<div><h3>Dependence on multiple entities and behaviour</h3>
<p>A system may be more private with respect to one entity (e.g., merchant) and less so for another (e.g., government). Privacy may also vary by user behaviour: for example, paying through an online account may reveal personal details. In designing a CBDC system’s privacy, we must consider many nuanced questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should all transactions be routinely disclosed to the government, or only some (by, e.g., dollar threshold)?</li>
<li>Should law enforcement be able to determine a person’s holdings, even if only approximately?</li>
<li>Should a payer’s identity be hidden from a merchant?</li>
<li>What transaction details should be shown to a payer’s MSB?</li>
<li>Should users be able to transact outside of KYC regulations to some extent?</li>
</ul>
<p>By using a framework to document CBDC privacy requirements, system designers can ensure they cover all entities and use design ideas from systems with similar privacy profiles.</p>
</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div><h2>Privacy techniques and design</h2>
<h3>Adopting privacy by design</h3>
<p>According to Cavoukian (2011) it is important that privacy with compliance be designed into the system from the outset. Privacy by design is a well-known approach that calls for privacy to be proactively engineered throughout the design process. The alternative, of doing a functional design first and adding privacy and compliance later, carries risks of unnecessary trade-offs.</p>
<h3>Customizing and combining privacy constructs to achieve a desired design</h3>
<p>Privacy design can apply building blocks of varying maturity and trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group signatures</strong> (Chaum and van Heyst 1991) allow a set of entities to transact while obscuring their identities, revealing only that “someone in the group” transacted.</li>
<li><strong>Secret sharing</strong> (Shamir 1979) or <strong>multi-signature</strong> (Itakura and Nakamura 1983) schemes can guarantee that sensitive data are disclosed only when an adequate number of entities (e.g., three of five) agree.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-knowledge proofs</strong> (Blum, Feldman and Micali 1988) can prove claims about data without revealing them (e.g., they can prove an account balance is adequate for a transaction without revealing the balance).</li>
<li><strong>Homomorphic encryption</strong> (Rivest, Adleman and Dertouzos 1978) allows mathematical operations on obscured data (e.g., payment of interest on a balance that is encrypted).</li>
<li><strong>Multi-party computation </strong>(Yao 1982) allows several entities to securely contribute their data to a combined dataset for fraud detection while keeping their data private from one another.</li>
<li><strong>Differential privacy</strong> (Dwork and Roth 2014) and <strong>anonymization</strong> are techniques that ensure personally identifiable information cannot be extracted from sensitive datasets. The data are rendered safe and private for uses such as research and data analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p>More techniques not covered here could be explored by system designers for potential use: for example, private information retrieval (Chor et al. 1998) and deniable encryption (Canetti et al. 1997). Most of these are flexible enough to be used across a variety of technology platforms (e.g., centralized, DLT and device-based) and can be combined and customized to achieve fine-grained CBDC privacy goals.</p>
</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div><h2>Privacy and governance</h2>
<h3>Optimal mix of business model, attributes and platform</h3>
<p>Knowing the CBDC business model, attributes and technology platform is essential to choosing the right constructs and combining them appropriately.</p>
<p>For example, consider a system where private transactions are verified by MSBs. If the business model states that MSBs are highly trusted, then privacy protocols can be simplified by assuming verifiers are honest. If not, the chosen protocols must guard against dishonest verifiers, which entails higher complexity. If amounts are hidden and policy dictates an interest-bearing CBDC, then chosen schemes must support encrypted computations of interest payments.</p>
<p>Further, the selection of privacy techniques will depend on the chosen platform. Typical proof systems are made up of provers (e.g., end-users) who generate proofs and verifiers (e.g., the systems) that check them. In a DLT system, multiple nodes perform verification, so system designers would need to ensure verification protocols are highly efficient. Centralized systems could tolerate slower verification. Another consideration is the trade-off between prover efficiency and proof size—algorithms that achieve fast proof generation generally result in large proofs. This could be a challenge in device-based solutions constrained by limited storage. Device-based solutions must also ensure that selected schemes can operate within the restrictions of sporadic CBDC network connectivity and limited computing capacity.</p>
<h3>The impact of complying with regulations on privacy and techniques</h3>
<p>A CBDC system is required to comply with regulations (e.g., KYC and AML). This can dictate the level of privacy and the selection of privacy techniques. KYC may require entities to store personal data with proper classification. Generally, achieving high levels of privacy while complying with …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I installed it last weekend, triggered by a high dose of nostalgia caused by reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom">The Masters of Doom</a>. (Thanks for the book recommendation, Robert!)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.bestoldgames.net/stare-hry/wolfenstein-3d.php">zipped shareware version</a> of the game has size of <em>692,526 bytes</em>. Yes, <em>bytes</em>! Roughly <em>676 kilobytes</em>. Unzipped, the game takes double that size, <em>1,409,981 bytes</em>. Roughly <strong>1.34 megabytes</strong>.</p><p>I started <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a> and in parallel, out of curiosity, Windows Task Manager. Once started, DOSBox quickly reached <em>71,824 kilobytes</em> of RAM. I loaded Wolfenstein 3D and like in good all days, almost in tears, I proudly announced that “I am Death incarnate”.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-i-am-death-incarnate.jpg" alt="I am Death incarnate"></p><p>The run through the Castle Wolfenstein started. Room after room, door after door, bullet after bullet I was running through the maze eating turkey dinners and dog food on my way to the next level.</p><p>And the DOSBox started asking for more memory, jumping from those <em>71,824 kilobytes</em> to <em>72,904 kilobytes</em> where it settled.</p><p>No matter how many enemy soldiers, secret rooms or other surprises were behind the next door I opened, the memory consumption didn’t go any higher.</p><p>The Task Manager is not the best way of measuring the memory consumption, I know. Especially in this case. But for the purpose of this strong impression I would say that it’s safely to assume that my nostalgic run through the Castle Wolfenstein took <em>72,904 - 71,824 = 1,080 kilobytes</em> of memory. <strong>One megabyte</strong>, roughly.</p><p>There was a lot in that one megabyte.</p><p>3D walls on left and right, with doors and suitable decorations.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-walls-with-decorations.jpg" alt="Walls with decorations"></p><p>Enemy soldiers shooting at me.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-enemy-soldiers-shooting-at-me.jpg" alt="Enemy soldiers shooting at me"></p><p>Actually, plenty of enemy soldiers shooting at me at the same time.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-plenty-of-enemy-soldiers-shooting-at-me-at-the-same-time.png" alt="Plenty of enemy soldiers shooting at me at the same time"></p><p>German shepherds jumping on me.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-german-shepherds-jumping-on-me.jpg" alt="German shepherds jumping on me"></p><p>Vast empty rooms with less going on.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-vast-empty-rooms-with-less-going-on.png" alt="Big spacey rooms with less going on"></p><p>The famous turkey dinner ready for picking up.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-turkey-dinner.jpg" alt="The famous turkey dinner ready for picking up"></p><p>Not to mention hidden treasures.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstain-3D-hidden-treasure.jpg" alt="Hidden treasures"></p><p>And all that consuming <strong>exactly <em>1,409,981 bytes</em> on my hard drive</strong> and <strong>roughly <em>one megabyte</em> of RAM</strong>.</p><h2 id="atom">Atom</h2><p>It happened that I recently installed <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> as well.</p><p>Atom is a text editor.</p><p>Obviously, you can edit text in it.</p><p>It supports auto-completion.</p><p>And has find and replace.</p><p>And has an integrated file system browser.</p><p>Syntax highlighting, although not being directly advertised on the homepage, is also there.</p><p>Now how cool is that!</p><p>Here is a glimpse on the mentioned “right out of the box” features that you’ll get after downloading and running Atom.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/atom-io-editing-mongo-db-source-file.png" alt="Atom.io"></p><p>Not much, compared to the 3D walls with doors and decorations and enemy soldiers and German shepherds and vast empty rooms and turkey dinners and hidden treasures and plenty of other surprises waiting for you in the Castle Wolfenstein.</p><p>Still, the <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.4.0">zipped Windows version of Atom</a> required me downloading <em>89,397,644 bytes</em> of data. Once unzipped it ate <em>263,518,515 bytes</em> of my hard drive. That’s <strong>roughly <em>263 megabytes</em> or 187 Wolfenstein 3Ds</strong>. For a text editor.</p><p>And it gets even worse.</p><p>Once started Atom spanned five (!?) processes consuming altogether <em>152,172 kilobytes</em> of RAM. That’s <strong>roughly 150 megabytes</strong>. And I even didn’t start writing anything! Neither auto-completing, nor browsing the file system in the integrated browser!</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/atom-io-memory-consumption-of-an-empty-file.png" alt="Atom.io memory consumption"></p><p>Honestly, I was afraid of typing a single “a” in that “untitled” file opened by default.</p><p>150 megabytes… For what? Plain text editing and auto-completion?</p><p>I couldn’t stop wondering how many more enemy soldiers and walls and vast empty rooms and turkey dinners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a> would have put into Wolfenstein 3D if he has had 150 megabytes of RAM at his disposal. To quote John:</p><blockquote><p>Mmm.</p></blockquote><h2 id="shakespeare">Shakespeare</h2><p>It happened also that I recently downloaded <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>.</p><p>There is <em>a lot</em> in Shakespeare.</p><p>Romeo and Juliet. Antony and Cleopatra. Hamlet. King Lear. Titus Andronicus, just to mention few I know. Julius Caesar is also there if I remember well. Than Othello. And the Merchant of Venice. A Midsummer Night’s Dream. And all those kings Henrys and Richards.</p><p>And then, there is a lot in each of those plays.</p><p>I watched a premiere of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello">Othello</a> in <a href="http://www.gavella.hr/">Gavella</a>. So, there is that guy Othello secretly marring Desdemona. And than the other guy Iago who hates Othello but Othello is not getting it. And then they all go to Cyprus with plenty of other people. And then Iago gets pretty creative in canalizing his hate toward Othello. And than comes the intermezzo because the play is way too long. And than after the intermezzo plenty of other things happen before everybody dies.</p><p>Later in the theatre’s hallway some lady was complaining that Gavella actually <em>shortened the plot</em>!</p><p>What I’m trying to say is - there is <em>a lot</em> in Othello. And not only in Othello. In Romeo and Juliet as well. And in Antony and Cleopatra for sure. And in Hamlet. In 1987 <a href="http://www.adrianhilton.com/">Adrian Hilton</a>, pictured below, acquired a <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-theatre-performance-individual/">Guinness World Record for longest theatre performance</a>. He was reciting the Complete Works of Shakespeare non-stop for 110 hours and 46 minutes. <strong>That’s 5 days of reciting.</strong> Without sleep!</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/adrian-hilton-reciting-shakespeare.jpg" alt="Adrian Hilton reciting Shakespeare"></p><p>All those “a lot”s combined together, downloaded from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> and saved in a plain text file take exactly <em>5,560,736 bytes</em>. <strong>5.5 megabytes</strong>, roughly.</p><p>Let me stress this fact once again. <strong>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare takes only 5.5 megabytes in plain text.</strong></p><h2 id="onenote">OneNote</h2><p>Recently I was forced to install the newest Windows update. And like after each update I ran out of space on my C drive. Corporate laptop, corporate C drive. I have very less control over it. This time it reached - literally - 0 kilobytes free.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/0-k-free-on-the-C-drive.png" alt="0 kilobytes free on the C drive"></p><p>I have no clue how Windows survived reaching zero kilobytes free. Outlook didn’t, by the way.</p><p>And so I started <a href="https://jam-software.com/treesize_free/">TreeSize Free</a> to see where I could save a gigabyte or two. Which reminded me of the trick I did last time when the C drive run out of space. I moved all my local OneNote documents to the E drive. That saved my apparently <em>17,797,901,002 bytes</em> of data and helped me live in peace for a few months. <em>17,797,901,002 bytes</em> of data. That’s <strong>17 gigabytes</strong>. Or <strong>3200 times more than Shakespeare</strong>.</p><p>I wouldn’t say anything if there was something in those 3200 Shakespeares. But there is literally <strong>nothing</strong> in my exactly six OneNote notebooks. Nothing! My diary, surely less eventful than Othello alone, some high level company’s visions, minutes of meetings and short memos. Altogether roughly of a size of A Midsummer Night’s Dream and King Lear combined. At best. Still, for whatever reason, <strong>OneNote needs 3200 Shakespeares to store it</strong>.</p><p>To quote Carmack again:</p><blockquote><p>Mmm.</p></blockquote><h2 id="back-to-the-bills-quote">Back to the “Bill’s” Quote</h2><blockquote><div><p>I’ve said some stupid things and some wrong things, but not that. No one involved in computers would ever say that a certain amount of memory is enough for all time. […] Meanwhile, I keep bumping into that silly quotation attributed to me that says 640K of memory is enough. There’s never a citation; the quotation just floats like a rumor, repeated again and again.</p><p> Bill Gates, <a href="http://www.wired.com/1997/01/did-gates-really-say-640k-is-enough-for-anyone/">Did Gates Really Say 640K is Enough For Anyone?</a></p></div></blockquote><p>C’mon Bill, even if you did say it - so what? It’s neither stupid, nor wrong, nor silly. 640K is obviously enough for plenty of things. For escaping from Castle Wolfenstein for example. Or carrying a good portion of Shakespeare around. After all, it’s not about how much resources our computers have. It’s about how we use them. Efficient usage makes them sufficient. Inefficient usage makes them insufficient.</p><p>My strong impression is telling me that we, as programmers, can do a much better job in keeping all those gigabytes of RAM and terabytes of hard drives sufficient enough for the time being.</p><h2 id="afterthought">Afterthought</h2><p>Despite the mentioned 150 MB I like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. And <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> even more. And I’m looking forward finding some time for trying out <a href="http://lighttable.com/">Light Table</a>. But for some strange reason, I always write my blog posts in the only editor that “is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions”. The good old <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> :-)</p><div><p>Wow, you've made it this far :-) The chances are you might like my next blog post as well ;-) Should I let you know when it's out?</p></div></div></div>]]>

There were a lot of new surprises (read: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/how-apple-silicon-changes-mac-forever-d2682a9722df">Apple’s own silicon chips for Macs</a>) from the world of SwiftUI, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/arkit4-putting-the-reality-back-in-augmented-reality-cea4ab775b8">ARKit</a>, PencilKit, Create ML, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/evolving-your-apps-intelligence-with-core-ml-model-deployment-165579ba0546">Core ML</a>. But the one that stood out for me was computer vision.</p><p id="bce9">Apple’s Vision framework got bolstered with a bunch of exciting new APIs that perform some complex and critical computer vision algorithms in a fairly straightforward way.</p><p id="718a">Starting with iOS 14, the Vision framework now supports Hand and Body Pose Estimation, Optical Flow, Trajectory Detection, and Contour Detection.</p><p id="078f">While we’ll provide an in-depth look at each of these some other time, right now, let’s dive deeper into one particularly interesting addition—the contour detection Vision request.</p><ul><li id="bcd1">Understanding Vision’s contour detection request.</li><li id="00c8">Running it in an iOS 14 SwiftUI application to detect contours along coins.</li><li id="63ab">Simplifying the contours by leveraging Core Image filters for pre-processing the images before passing them on to the Vision request. We’ll look to mask the images in order to reduce texture noise.</li></ul></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d6a5">Contour detection detects outlines of the edges in an image. Essentially, it joins all the continuous points that have the same color or intensity.</p><p id="fb67">This computer vision task is useful for shape analysis, edge detection, and is helpful in scenarios where you need to find similar types of objects in an image.</p><p id="c5f4">Coin detection and segmentation is a fairly common use case in OpenCV, and now by using Vision’s new <code>VNDetectContoursRequest</code>, we can perform the same in our iOS applications easily (without the need for third-party libraries).</p><p id="3973">To process images or frames, the Vision framework requires a <code>VNRequest</code>, which is passed into an image request handler or a sequence request handler. What we get in return is a <code>VNObservation</code> class.</p><p id="4ad5">You can use the respective <code>VNObservation</code> subclass based on the type of request you’re running. In our case, we’ll use <code>VNContoursObservation</code>, which provides all the detected contours from the image.</p><p id="8298">We can inspect the following properties from the <code>VNContoursObservation</code>:</p><ul><li id="a70a"><code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vncontoursobservation/3548363-normalizedpath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normalizedPath</a></code> — It returns the path of detected contours in normalized coordinates. We’d have to convert it into the UIKit coordinates, as we’ll see shortly.</li><li id="5ea7"><code>contourCount</code> — The number of detected contours returned by the Vision request.</li><li id="d7ad"><code>topLevelContours</code> — An array of <code>VNContours</code> that aren’t enclosed inside any contour.</li><li id="803a"><code>contour(at:)</code> — Using this function, we can access a child contour by passing its index or <code>IndexPath</code>.</li><li id="c47a"><code>confidence</code> — The level of confidence in the overall <code>VNContoursObservation</code>.</li></ul><blockquote><p id="b960">Note: Using <code>topLevelContours</code> and accessing child contours is handy when you need to modify/remove them from the final observation.</p></blockquote><p id="fcbd">Now that we’ve got an idea of Vision contour detection request, let’s explore how it might work it in an iOS 14 application.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="367c">To start off, you’ll need <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12-beta-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xcode 12 beta</a> as the bare minimum.

Specifically for coins that have a similar color intensity that’s different from the background, using the black and white color filter for masking coins is a better bet.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png?q=20" width="949" height="768" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1898/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png" width="949" height="768" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="f4ed">For each of the above pre-processing types, we’ve also set a Gaussian filter to smoothen the image.

You’re wondering what web development interview questions the interviewer is going to fire off at you. Your mind is playing on your nerves. Tension rising notch by notch. “Am I really ready for that coding interview?” — you start beating yourself up.</p><p id="dd5e">You check your phone — it’s 3:05 pm. No missed calls. Nothing.</p><p id="f93c">You anxiously recheck your phone — 3:15 pm… still nothing.</p><p id="4c5c">You are already 30 minutes under pressure, sweating and silently moaning — your heart races. The latent impostor syndrome arises from the depths. You start freaking out… wondering whether or not you’ve given the wrong phone number… or if they might have forgotten about you.</p><p id="5e62">Your mind is leading a furious battle to overcome your anxious trains of thought. You, filled with a desperate hope, grab your phone with your sweaty pawl and look at it for one last time… and then… it rings.</p><p id="845c">You pick up and say, “Hello,” trying to hide the trembling notes in your voice, the anxious quiver of your lips and fingers, while battling the excruciating jittery inside your mind. You introduce each other and then… kinds of interview questions for web developers thrown at you, catching you off guard, that you can barely give an adequate answer to.</p><p id="d227">You realize that you are completely f*cked up. The overwhelming anxiety is growing deeper and deeper in you. You feel like you have a 200-kg bench press on your chest that you can’t lift. Vertigo comes along, and you suddenly forget. You forget your location, the person you are talking to… everything. Hands so sweaty that you just can’t hold your phone without it slipping through your fingers.</p><p id="a240">You know that the chances of making a good impression are so damn low that you’d have more luck if you were to bet on racing cockroaches.</p><p id="262a">To avoid that, you need strong preparation for the next coding interview. You need to have a grasp of the interview questions for web developers you are being asked. That will boost your confidence and diminish the anxiety before the phone or onsite interview.</p><p id="ab34">In this article, I’ll talk about the principles behind the developer interview process — the most common web developer questions you can expect from interviewers and how to answer them in a fascinating way that will put a WOW expression on their faces (even if they want to rip your head off, rearrange your face, or just clean their shoes ;-) ).</p><p id="a90c">To start off, you need to realize that the web dev interviewing process is more like a negotiation. You’ve been probably taught as a kid that you need to be flawless during interviews and answer every question accurately to make a good impression and get hired.</p><p id="b625">This couldn’t be further from the truth (coming from someone who got hired by sending out a cold message directly to their employer — no official nor traditional interview process).</p><p id="e763">Yes, of course, you need to make a good impression. But if you think that making a good impression comes down to awkwardly staring at your interviewer, frozen, while answering every developer interview question like a robot… you’re highly mistaken my friend.</p><p id="804e">You need to be able to communicate with your future employer freely while at the same time exuding confidence, knowledge, curiosity, and most importantly, enthusiasm.</p><p id="e9be">Here are the main things employers look for when hiring people:</p><ol><li id="c9d8"><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Have-a-Great-Personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personality</a>.</li><li id="bc1a"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/whats-the-difference-between-a-programmer-coder-developer-and-engineer-bd315404de7">Basic qualifications</a>.</li><li id="5b8b"><a href="http://breathehr.com/blog/what-is-cultural-fit-and-why-is-it-important" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture fit</a>.</li><li id="e3a7"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/how-to-become-a-10x-engineer-492fa3f57101">Enthusiasm</a>.</li></ol><p id="c68d">You need to have a fitting personality, meaning, you need to be able to easily communicate with your team without any hassle whatsoever. You need to ask clear and concise questions while at the same time, giving thorough and detailed answers.</p><p id="51b8">Of course, you also need to possess basic qualifications for the job you are applying for. Yet, many people seem to put tons of attention to that one (which is perfectly fine), but it’s just ¼ of the whole equation.</p><p id="61d9">Culture fit — this ties back into your personality. You have to be able to sync with your team and develop a culture that everyone enjoys working in.</p><p id="147b">And finally, have a burning passion and enthusiasm for your job. You’ll be surprised how helpful enthusiasm can be.</p><p id="eee3">For example, you may not have as good a resume as the guy in the next room that’s also being interviewed… but if you display a burning enthusiasm and willingness to go out of your way, you can beat other candidates and win the job. Of course, that may not always be the case. Still, it’s much more likely for an employer to hire you as a hyper enthusiastic person than as an average employee.</p><p id="2cb1">Alright, let’s take a look at some of the most common web developer interview questions (and answers) you may encounter. We’ll first start with professional software engineer behavioral questions and then switch over to more technical questions.</p><p id="6540">Whether you are a front-end, back-end, or full-stack software developer, these common computer science interview questions will help you in your preparation for the next coding interview.</p><p id="0f2d">NOTE: Some of the behavioral questions can also be noticed in web design interviews. So if you are a web designer, this article will highly prepare you for the next web design interview.</p><p id="53af">Most interviewers start off with introductory questions. Just follow the common sense when answering these software engineer interview questions. Try to be as transparent as possible. Tell them what really sparked your interest in coding and why you applied for this job.</p><p id="9720">If you are applying for an entry-level web developer job, interviewers won’t expect years of experience (they may even skip that question) as you’ve probably just graduated or finished a coding boot camp. Yet, if you are applying for a senior software engineer position, you need to have years of experience to back up your application for that web development job.</p><p id="ed12">You need to get familiar with Agile frameworks such as Kanban and Scrum because nowadays companies are adopting Agile practices and moving away from Waterfall methodologies. Interviewers may also ask you questions about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-development-life-cycle-the-ultimate-guide-2020-153d17bb20fb">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) process</a>.</p><p id="3aa1">As simple as that. You might want to focus on the specific languages that your web development job will require you to use most frequently.</p><p id="b2b4">Lately, having experience with multiple languages like C++, Java, and Python will definitely widen your interviewer’s eyes in astonishment.</p><p id="588b"><em>Credits to Andrew Mallonee, CEO at </em><a href="https://malloneemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Mallonee Media</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="0286">Be transparent and give a thorough explanation.. Sometimes, the interviewer might follow up with, “Do you get excited by using these languages?” but rarely. Obviously, reply with Yes and explain why you feel excited.</p><p id="fb59">It’s more of a soft skill interview question. Software engineering is a job in which you need to always thrive and sharpen your skills. Employers need to know that their developers are on the cutting edge using the latest technologies and constantly honing their skills. So, the answer to that software developer interview question would obviously be “Yes” — but expand further by telling them what interests you the most when it comes to learning new coding skills.</p><p id="14d6">Talk about projects similar to the projects you are going to be working on in the position you are applying for. If not, be genuine (always) and tell them what really sparks your passion for software development.</p><p id="e2fd">Here, interviewers particularly want to hear about severe problems, not many people on your team were able to solve, yet you were. Something important to remember is not to try to impress the interviewer — the scales will fall from his eyes immediately. Instead of making a good impression, you’ll make a desperate one. Be casual when talking about the problem that no one was able to solve except you. You, thus, exude confidence and knowledge. Being humble in the answer of this web dev interview question is key.</p><p id="6399">Another soft skill interview question. Life is about learning from your mistakes. Be as transparent as possible and openly admit the mistakes you’ve made in the past. Talk about the lessons you’ve learned. Basically, explain how you coped with your worst failures and came out stronger.</p><p id="bf9b">Research a lot prior to the interview. Go through all of their social media profiles to find little nuggets of information that would impress your interviewer. Show passion and enthusiasm for the company. Enthusiasm plays a huge role in the interview process.</p><p id="7b49">Same as previous — conduct thorough research and analysis before the interview. Show passion and enthusiasm. Tell the interviewer why you would love to work on those particular projects. They can thus see the reason behind that enthusiasm and wind out the thoughts of all that being a mere fluff.</p><p id="b2c0">These web development interview questions can happen over the phone or onsite.</p><p id="e12a">The following technical interview questions typically happen onsite, but sometimes they can take place remotely. If it’s remotely, the interviewer will ask you to share your screen to watch over your shoulder while you are coding and at the same time answering software development interview questions.</p><p id="c6ea">Keep in mind that the technical questions you are being asked highly depend on the position you are applying for. We’ll try to cover some of the most common software developer interview questions and give you reasonable answers that you can adjust to your situation easily.</p><p id="699b"><em>Credits to Michael Miller, CEO at </em><a href="https://vpnonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>VPN Online</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="fc04">There are lots of ways you can write your code, and all of them are correct. The company you want to join probably has a set standard for writing code and will perhaps compare your answer to that standard. Usually, most companies look for developers who take the simplest approach to code and try to weep out those who praise the sophisticated way of coding. That’s because companies want to easily maintain and document their code.</p><p id="3b99">Java developer interview questions are quite common. When interviewers ask you …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

        <article>
                        
<p>The aim of this project was to display a colour image on a black and white monitor, by overlaying an acetate bayer filter over the monitor and mosaicing a colour image.</p>



<p>I obtained an Eizo B&amp;W monitor from ebay, which I was intending for use viewing B&amp;W photos and was curious if I could replicate an effect similar to <strong>Autochrome Lumière</strong> ( see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochrome_Lumi%C3%A8re">wikipedia</a> ) where they overlay colour filters over a B&amp;W photographic plate, using starch grains, which creates a colour image.</p>



<p>The following image shows a 500x microscope image of the pixels that make up the B&amp;W LCD display, taken using a very cheap USB microscope.  It looks to me as if each pixel, is represented by 4 sub-pixel elements, please correct me if this appears not be the case.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>A pdf was created of the bayer display, with the dimensions 433.1mm x 324.8mm.  The monitor has a resolution of 2048×1536 and I assumed the pixels had the same width as height.</p>



<p>You can see an example of the pdf I created below, where for example a blue element, should be represented by 2×2 pixels from the B&amp;W monitor. </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1024x540.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1024x540.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-300x158.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-768x405.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1536x810.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I created 3 pdfs:</p>



<ul><li>bayer_1.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 1 pixel from the display</li><li>bayer_2.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 2×2 pixels from the display (this is the acetate used in the video)</li><li>bayer_4.pdf – each element is represented by 4×4 pixels from the display</li></ul>



<p>The following image shows the printed acetate with the bayer pattern:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The following, is a B&amp;W image with mosaicing applied from the colour image:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-300x225.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-768x576.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>How it works</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1024x616.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1024x616.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-768x462.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1536x923.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1.png 1898w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The monitor I am using seems to generally be used portrait, to make it landscape on linux:</p>


<pre title="">xrandr --output HDMI1 --rotate left
</pre>


<h2>Image of effect</h2>



<p>As you can see the effect of my attempt is quite slight, but you can see in the centre the different colours of the balloons.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001.jpg"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>Video of effect</h2>



<p>The effect is also demonstrated in the following video, with the following parameters:</p>


<pre title=""> mpv out.mkv --fullscreen --loop --brightness=10 --contrast=20
</pre>


<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rainbow - using an acetate bayer filter over a B&amp;W monitor" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sh2d9qAjYPo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2>Microscope images of the bayer filter (2×2 scaling)</h2>



<p>2×2 bayer filter, I tried to design it so that for example the ‘red’ square covers 2×2 pixels on the monitor</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<h2>Chess board </h2>



<p>As suggested by Olivier, I’ve just created 2 chess board images.  Olivier was correct that a single pixel consists of 3 sub-pixels 🙂</p>



<p>1×1 (the white patch is 1 pixel), monitor in landscape, image in correct orientation from microscope (left, towards left monitor, top, towards top of monitor)</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>2×2 </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<h2>Possible improvements</h2>



<p>I wonder if by measuring the exact pixel width/height under a microscope, if the effect could possibly be improved somewhat, as that information could be used when creating the acetate filter.</p>



<p>Alignment is also a key issue, I need to think of ways to improve that possibly using a microscope while aligning the acetate.</p>



<p>I’d be interested in other improvements I could make too!</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, built on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <strong>Foam</strong> for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you’re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace for all your knowledge and research following the <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a> guide.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template">foam-template project</a> to generate a new repository. If you’re logged into GitHub, you can just hit this button:</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate" data-icon="octicon-repo-template" data-size="large" aria-label="Use this template foambubble/foam-template on GitHub">Use this template</a></p>

    <p>(If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private, or if you don’t want to use GitHub to host your workspace at all, choose <strong>Download as ZIP</strong> instead of <strong>Use this template</strong>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone the repository locally</a> and open it in VS Code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

This analysis is <em>flow-insensitive</em> - it does not depend on the flow of the execution of the program. If an expression is of type <code>int</code> then it will have type <code>int</code> regardless of what was executed before or after it.</p><p>Some program properties do however depend on the execution path taken by a program. Dataflow analysis tracks how a particular value might propagate as the program executes.</p><p>For example, a value might <em>alias</em> - you could have multiple references pointing to that value. Whether two references <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> alias can’t be determined by looking at their assignments in isolation - we need to track the execution to determine if they have the same value assigned to them.</p><div><p><span>alias_example</span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> x </span><span>=</span><span> someObject</span></p><p><span></span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> y </span><span>=</span><span> someObject </span></p></pre></div></div><p>Another example is <strong>liveness analysis</strong> - we say a value is <em>live</em> if some point later in the program it could be used, and <em>dead</em> otherwise.</p><div><p><span>liveness_example</span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> x </span><span>=</span><span> someValue </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>x </span><span>=</span><span> someOtherValue </span></p></pre></div></div><p>Why do we care about alias analysis and liveness analysis? Well it turns out that Rust’s <em>borrow-checker</em> uses a combination of these to determine when a reference is borrowed. Bolt has a <em>linear</em> capability in its type system which acts the same.</p><p>Both Rust’s borrow checker and Bolt’s capabilities prevent data races - an explanation why is in <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt-dissertation/blob/master/dissertation.pdf">my dissertation</a>.</p><p>In a nutshell, Rust works on the principle of <strong>ownership</strong>: you either have one reference (owner) that can read/write (a <em>mutable</em> reference) or you can <em>borrow</em> (aka alias) the reference.</p><p>To enforce this we care about 2 things:</p><ol><li>When is a reference borrowed? (alias analysis)</li><li>For how long is it borrowed? (liveness analysis)</li></ol><p>Let’s elaborate on that second point. When is a reference borrowed? The first version of Rust’s borrow checker said this was whilst an alias was in scope.</p><div><p><span>borrow_example</span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> x </span><span>=</span><span> something </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> y </span><span>=</span><span> x</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  x </span><span>=</span><span> somethingElse</span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></div></div><p>That means we cannot reassign <code>x</code> in the example until <code>y</code> is out of scope. This is a “lexical lifetime” - <code>y</code>’s borrow lifetime is determined by its lexical scope. So that means <code>x</code> can’t be reassigned, since it is borrowed at that point. But <code>y</code> isn’t being used so surely <code>x</code> isn’t still borrowed?</p><p>That’s the idea behind <strong>non-lexical lifetimes</strong> - the borrow ends when the value of <code>y</code> is dead - i.e. it is not being used.</p><p>In Bolt, we’ll be tracking the lifetimes of references to <em>objects</em>.</p><p>Let’s get implementing it!</p><h2 id="alias-analysis"><a href="#alias-analysis" aria-label="alias analysis permalink"></a>Alias Analysis</h2><p>The first step is to determine when two values alias. How do we know two references will point to the same object without actually executing the program?</p><p>We use <strong>abstract interpretation</strong>.</p><h3 id="abstract-interpretation"><a href="#abstract-interpretation" aria-label="abstract interpretation permalink"></a>Abstract Interpretation</h3><p>Abstract interpretation is the process of simulating the execution of the program but only storing the program properties we care about. So in our case, we don’t care about what the actual result of the program execution is, we’re just tracking the <em>set of aliases</em>.</p><div><p>Implicit in this is a set of rules for how the program will execute, we call this its <strong>operational semantics</strong>. We will not go into details here, but it’s things like:</p><ul><li>Do we evaluate expressions left-to-right or right-to-left?</li><li>When calling a function, do we fully evaluate the argument expression and then call the function with the value of that argument, or do we just plug in the unevaluated argument expression directly into the function and only evaluate it at the point it is used in the function body? The former is called <strong>call-by-value</strong> and is used in most mainstream languages like Java and Python, the latter is called <strong>call-by-name</strong> and is used in Haskell and Lisp.</li></ul><p>There’s a lot more to say about this - perhaps it’s worthy of its own blog post? Send me a tweet if you would like one!</p></div><p>When do we have aliasing? When a new variable is declared or when it is reassigned. For simplicity (and also because we don’t want the lifetime of the alias to be larger than the original value) we will not allow aliasing via reassigning an existing variable (e.g. <code>x := y</code>).</p><p>So we care about expressions of this form:</p><p>The expression <code>e</code> can <em>reduce</em> to a value when executing e.g. <code>1+2</code> reduces to <code>3</code>.</p><p>If when executing <code>e</code> it reduces to a reference <code>y</code>, then the overall expression would look like:</p><p>And so <code>x</code> would alias <code>y</code>.

    </span></p><p>So we repeat, until we find no more aliases. The full code is linked in the repo, and includes an option of matching fields (i.e. should we consider aliases of <code>x.f</code> as well as <code>x</code>?)

    <p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/analytics.jpg" alt="Analytics"></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am not going to discuss about whether logging visitors is a good or a bad practice, I am going to assume that this has already been analyzed and decided, and that the final decision is that logging visitors and statics is needed.</p>

<p>With that defined, now comes the question, which logging solution should be used.</p>

<h2 id="some-alternatives">Some Alternatives</h2>

<p>The alternatives comes in two main groups</p>

<h3 id="server-logs-analyzers">Server logs analyzers</h3>

<p>If the site is served from just one server, or if the spread logs can be joined, then those logs can be parsed and analyzed by a specialized software that will show the results in a fancy and readable format. The options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://awstats.sourceforge.io/">Awstats</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.webalizer.org/">Webalizer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://goaccess.io/">Goaccess</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All those three are open source, and easy to use, the main advantage is that privacy of the visitor is respected, and no info is going out the website's server.</p>

<h3 id="online-analytics-software">Online analytics software</h3>

<p>The second main set of alternatives are online analytics tools, there are a lot of them, here will be listed the most common ones.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://matomo.org/home/">Matomo</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.openwebanalytics.com/">Open Web Analytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://metrical.xyz/">Metrical</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">SimpleAnalytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Except the first one, all others provide an option to log with no cookies, so, they are cookie GDPR compliant. I really recommend you to stay away from Google Analytics and use any of the other options here listed.</p>

<h2 id="plausible">Plausible</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-home-page.png" alt="plausible-home-page"></p>

<p>Plausible is a relatively new service created by <a href="https://twitter.com/ukutaht">Uku</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/markosaric">Marko</a>, the service was created first on Uku's free time at the end of 2018, looking for a tool that can offer 80% of Google Analytics benefits with only 20% of the complexity.</p>

<p>The result was Plausible</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>As stated above plausible aims at being simple, avoid complexity and be a lightweight alternative to Google Analytics, therefore it is not as feature rich as Google Analytics, but most of GA features are never used anyway, or are inaccurate and thus unusable.</p>

<p><strong>Online Visitors</strong></p>

<p>At the top of its page there is an indicator showing the number of current visitors, this is one of the best features, because it can be used by system administrators to check if the number of online visitors could be related with some service degradation, or the extra load on server resources.</p>

<p><strong>Date Range</strong></p>

<p>The date range can be  selected from the menu at the right top of the screen</p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-date-range.png" alt="plausible-date-range"></p>

<p>The menu offers different pre-sets as seen above, and a custom range from where any range can be selected.</p>

<p><strong>Top referrers</strong></p>

<p>The screen is divided in quadrants with different information for the users, the first one is top-referrers</p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-top-referrers.png" alt="plausible-top-referrers"></p>

<p>At first glance the top nine can be seen, and clicking on <em>more</em> it shows the complete list of referrers, this information is presented for the date rage selected above.</p>

<p><strong>Top Pages</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-top-pages.png" alt="plausible-top-pages"></p>

<p>At the right of Top Referrer is located Top Pages, and it shows the most visited pages in the selected date range, once again if more is clicked the complete list is shown in the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Countries</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-countries.png" alt="plausible-countries"></p>

<p>Still in the dashboard, and below Top Referrers, the information of countries from where the visitors to the site are coming is located. The world map is shown, and using color coding the countries that send more visitors are easily identifiable, and if the <em>more</em> button is clicked a complete list of the countries with the percentage of visitors is shown on the screen, but if the mouse pointer is hovered over the map the number of visitors that came to the site in the selected date range is shown.</p>

<p><strong>Devices</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-devices.png" alt="plausible-devices"></p>

<p>Finally, the last quadrant of the dashboard shows different information about devices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size: Shows the size of the screen, it actually says if the visitor  came from a Desktop, laptop, tablet or phone</li>
  <li>Browser: This one shows the browser the visitors were using, and the percentage of users with different browsers</li>
  <li>OS: Finally, this one shows the percentage of visitors using the different Operating Systems when landing on the website.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3>

<p>Pricing is simple, given the number of visitors to the websites, there is an associated price</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Visitors per month</th>
      <th>Price $us</th>
    </tr>

<p>There is no extra charge for more sites, any number of sites can be logged, and they only charge for the accumulated number of visitors.</p>

<p>Once subscribed to a plan, they do not charge extra if the number of visitors of the selected package is surpassed, nor the visits stop being logged. But if for two months in a row the limit is surpassed, a higher packages should be selected or the account should be canceled.</p>

<p>There is a discount on any package if yearly is payment is selected.</p>

<p><strong>Code size</strong></p>

<p>The javascript snipped that needs to be installed in the webpages to be logged weights less than 1 Kbyte.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Domain</strong></p>

<p>The javascript file can be downloaded from a custom domain, making it more efficient as it is less prone to be blocked by browsers</p>

<p><strong>No Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Plausible takes privacy seriously, no cookies are used to track visitors, their visits are logged when they land on the website and some statistical information is recorded, no visitor is identifiable.</p>

<p>Using Plausible website owners comply with GDPR, CCPA</p>

<p>According to its website, this is the info they collect from visitors.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Data point</th><th>Example</th><th>Comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Page URL</td><td>https://yoursite.com/pricing</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;track the page URL of each page view on your website. We use this to&nbsp;&nbsp;show you which pages have been viewed and how many times a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;page has been viewed. <p>The hostname and path are collected. Query parameters are discarded, except for these special query parameters: ref=, source= and utm_source=.</p></td></tr><tr><td>HTTP Referer</td><td>https://facebook.com</td><td>We use the referrer string to show you the number of visitors referred to your website from links on other sites.</td></tr><tr><td>Browser</td><td>Chrome</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;use this to show you what browsers people use when visiting your&nbsp;&nbsp;website. This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header. The full&nbsp;&nbsp;User-Agent is discarded.</td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>macOS</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;use this to show you what operating systems people use when visiting&nbsp;&nbsp;your website.

We do not track&nbsp;&nbsp;anything more granular than the country of origin and the IP address of&nbsp;&nbsp;the visitor is discarded. We never store IP addresses in our database or&nbsp;&nbsp;logs.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Even the IP that is used to determine unique visitors is not stored on the database, and it is hashed and then stored, that way no visitor is identifiable.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>

<p>Finally all code is open source, so anyone can check it to be sure privacy is respected.</p>

<p><strong>Self Hosted option</strong></p>

<p>On June 12, 2020 Plausible was made available for self host it. The instructions as well as the code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/blob/master/HOSTING.md">Plausible repository</a></p>

<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>

<p>Statistics help webmasters and system administrator to better manage websites, it also important for companies to follow any campaign success or failure, but at the same time visitor's privacy should be respected.</p>

<p>Plausible gives enough information to website owners in a clear and easily readable way while respecting visitors privacy.</p>

<p>There are other options, but for me, for the price the simplicity and information given, <strong>Plausible</strong> is the best option.</p>

Distributing Attention

<p><span><span>Turns out people shouldn't neglect the intrinsic value of the present. On the importance of how we distribute our attention.</span></span><br>
<span><span>All political ideologies are an expression of a policy with an attention distribution.</span></span></p>
<div><p>
The way attention is distributed tells a lot about ideology.</p><table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3MOSHVx_d5g/XgXb0LZdYcI/AAAAAAAAWm0/vtJva24F394n-tpoVIiueIQhy6n2rEF1ACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/attention-distribution-curve.png" imageanchor="1"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3MOSHVx_d5g/XgXb0LZdYcI/AAAAAAAAWm0/vtJva24F394n-tpoVIiueIQhy6n2rEF1ACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/attention-distribution-curve.png"></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><span>Attention distribution curves</span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>

<p>
Whereas Moderate (Conservatist) ideologies are focusing their attention on multiple layers of the present (Curve B), Primitive (Immobilist), and Radical (Progressivist) ideologies, focus their attention on the edges of the present (Curve A).</p><p>


Immobilism is about procrastination of expectations.<br>
Conservatism is about prediction of expectations.<br>
Progressivism is about anticipation of expectations.</p><p>

Immobilist and Progressivist ideologies are complementary.</p></div>
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VbM3qZttnmI/XSIP33QGpUI/AAAAAAAAU-g/EZCC291tUOcp6KAN7CLdmtx9I5PbI_AxQCLcBGAs/s1600/political-ideologies.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="978" data-original-width="977" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VbM3qZttnmI/XSIP33QGpUI/AAAAAAAAU-g/EZCC291tUOcp6KAN7CLdmtx9I5PbI_AxQCLcBGAs/s640/political-ideologies.png" width="636"></a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Political ideologies and their respective policies.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<div><p>
All political ideologies are an expression of a policy.</p><p>

Whether the policy is about spread, diversity or dependency of attention, whether it is generalisation, specialisation, concentration, diffusion, separation or unification, what makes monarchism different from capitalism and imperialism is how it assumes attention should be distributed.</p><p>

Whereas Moderate Conservatist ideologies are complementary to other Moderate (Conservatist) ideologies, Primitive (Immobilist) ideologies are complementary to Radial (Primitivist) ideologies.</p><p>

Example :<br>
- Populism Primitive Immobilist ideology is complementary to Equalitarianism Radical progressivist ideology.<br>
- Feudalism Radical Progressivist ideology is complementary to Syndicalism Primitive Immobilist ideology.<br>
- Corporatism Moderate Conservatist ideology is complementary to Republicanism Moderate Conservatist&nbsp;ideology.<br>
And so on.</p><p>


There is a state of equilibrium that attention policies can reach and maintain.<br>We can suppose that it is this state of equilibrium that any correctly functioning general&nbsp;intelligence seeks to optimize it's memories for.</p></div>

Turns Out People Shouldn't Try to Learn From Failure. On The Importance of Growing Success 
People often say that failure is the best teacher. But is it really true? </p><p> 
First, let's define a few things :<br>
Growing : It's when there's more of it and more of it and more if it ...<br>
Success : When you expect something and it happens<br>
Failure : When you expect something and it doesn't happen</p><p>
The problem with people who think that they can learn from failure is that they will not pay enough attention to their successes and try to learn from failure and then fail to learn.</p><p>
The only way someone can learn is from success.</p><p>
There is no other way to succeed than to try something often and repeatedly and see if it meets our expectations every time.</p><p>
The greater amount of success you have the greater amount of success you will have, unless...</p><p>
Unless you think that failure teaches anything.</p><p>
Thinking that people can learn from failure is wishful thinking.</p><p>
There is nothing to learn from fa…

Turns out amateurs don't become professionals the day they get paid. On the importance of consistency in accuracy.<br>
Professionals are often portrayed as being paid amateurs but my take on this is that getting payed is only a symptom of being a professional.</p><p>
If getting payed is only a symptom then what causes someone to be a professional?</p><p>
A professional is capable of consistently predicting the outcomes of his actions.<br>
An amateur is capable of consistently surprising everyone, including himself.<br>
It's not sure whether it will be a good outcome, or whether it will be a bad outcome, one thing is sure it's that it's not clear what the outcome will be.</p></div>

                <p>Last year as I kicked off my career entering the professional tech world, I came across the concept of <strong>Objective, Key and Results (OKRs)</strong> at work. I was quite intrigued by the whole concept of OKRs.</p>

<p>In very layman terms —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Main objective of OKR is to plan out qualitative goals with quantitative results for those with proper time tracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People do use diary or todo apps for tracking there work. Todo apps usually work for tracking tasks over a shorter duration. You need a framework to plan out for your bigger goal and track your progress towards it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bX5Vy1OPJ3LImq9DHIgU5g.png" alt="Personal OKR Header Section"></p>

<p>In this blog, I will try to explain how you can plan and why it is important to have your Personal OKR. Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>OKRs is already a very popular term in business, most probably it is being used at your workplace too. It is a <strong>goal-setting framework</strong> that basically covers big and challenging goals with a set of defined measurable results for achieving these goals.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective — </h3>

<ul>
  <li>What do you want to achieve over a period of time?</li>
  <li>Objectives should be ambitious, more <strong>inspirational</strong> (which requires more effort of yours), bold and <strong>qualitative</strong></li>
  <li>Your targets should not be something very easily achievable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Improve the financial condition, Get better at reading, etc</p>

<h3 id="key-results">Key Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li>KRs are steps you need to achieve the objective.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Quantitative</strong> i.e having defined metrics! This should not be vague. Add numbers, avoid terms like “more/less”.<br>
Google uses. a scale of 0–1 for tracking progress for each key result.</li>
  <li>Make KRs <strong>Time-bounded</strong>. This helps you tracking progress over the period and lets you recalibrate your tasks.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Binary</strong> i.e Complete / Incomplete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Read 3 books on investing, Read 1500 pages monthly, etc</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="personal-vs-work-okrs">Personal vs Work OKRs?</h3>

<p>OKRs are used by both teams and individuals, though mostly in work environments. The concept of OKR is simple and works pretty effectively for personal use as well. It is super important to have separate personal and work OKRs since your work goals are different from personal life and goals.</p>

<p>In personal OKRs, you would want to track things like —</p>

<ol>
  <li>Family time</li>
  <li>Personal finance</li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Hobbies</li>
</ol>

<p>Personal OKRs are <strong>literally personal</strong>!<br>
It varies from person to person. It’s good to look for ideas on how people use OKRs, but you should align it for your goals and aspirations which you want to achieve.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actions — and data — speak louder than words.”<br>
― <strong>John Doerr,</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/54960827"><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OKRs help you plan your goals in a structured and planned fashion, but there is more to it! Let me explain —</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>Alignment</strong> on what you want to achieve. Since OKRs are limited, you don’t want to waste time and do stuff that doesn’t really help you achieve what you want!</li>
  <li>These give the <strong>Motivation</strong> to work towards your objectives and a sense of urgency to finish them.</li>
  <li>OKRs help in building a <strong>Habit</strong> of planning things in general and following the path to achieving them. Eg. You have an objective of getting better at reading, you start reading 30 pages daily. Now, it slowly builds into your habit to read. Next year, even if you don’t have this objective, you’ll still read :)</li>
  <li><strong>Time Tracking</strong> is super useful and important since they give a timeline for you to work and align your tasks accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> and Numbers help you visualize your progress. When you see 80% completion, you get a psychological motivation to make it 100%</li>
  <li>If you have a <strong>Public OKR</strong>, you get another source to actually work and complete your task.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘I’d rather have the objective be to go to Mars, and if we fall short, we’ll get to the moon. This is how you make moonshots. — Larry Page</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/benefits-of-okrs/">Measure what matters</a> brings a similar <strong>F.A.C.T.S</strong> showing the benefits of OKRs.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>Now, that you understand the importance of Personal OKRs and are ready to create yours, I’ll show how I personally maintain my OKRs and share resources that might be useful for you!</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>There are a lot of tools that you can use to start creating an OKR. I personally being a big fan of <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, use it to maintain my Personal OKRs. You can use anything from professional notes and trackers like <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to simple excel sheet template.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*IOarq_FgPMWWVqohXAMvHg.png" alt="OKR Tracking with Notes"></p>

<p>I usually update my OKRs monthly since I maintain a yearly OKR tracker. You can adjust it according to the timeline you are planning for.</p>

<p>I maintain different tables for each of my Objectives. In the image below</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> — Boost Knowledge</p>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong> —</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Read 20 books</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create 2 open source projects</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Time Tracking</strong> — <br>
I maintain time tracking based on which quarter of the year I want this to be completed. I do break these KRs into sub-tasks which are added to my Todolist with a specified timeline.<br>
I use <strong>EOY</strong> (End of Year) in cases when I want that KR to be worked on throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>—</p>

<p>I set my KRs progress to one of the 5 stages. It helps me keep track of what to do next and what is already completed. I sometimes add <strong>At-Risk</strong> tag to denote that this KR is probably not happening. I already added <strong>At-Risk</strong> to my traveling KRs this year credits to corona :(</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HQJ56kvlk0-mDZiXBrptfw.png" alt="Quarter based timeframe and Status for tracking progress"></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>  — <br>
These are basically notes/links relevant to KR which I would want to revisit when I come back to this sometime later.</p>

<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid changing OKRs</strong>! It is okay to update OKRs when you achieve something or want to divert. Do not remove OKRs just because you are doing something else now, at the end of the timeframe you should know that you failed at this due to XYZ reason, and was it worth it or not?</li>
  <li>You will fail in many Key results! <strong>It is okay to fail</strong>, now you get an idea on what did you miss, how can you improve and rework accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly update your KRs status and notes</strong>, this gives you an idea of where you need to focus more in the next few days. A biweekly or monthly review is generally a good time to revisit OKRs. I set up a biweekly reminder in my calendar for this!</li>
  <li>You can <strong>add a score</strong> to each KR to make things more interesting. For the first time, I wanted to keep it simple. Do share if you use some interesting scoring :P</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid setting too many OKRs</strong> instead make the OKRs more challenging.</li>
  <li>Add links to your weekly tasks in notes sections. This helps you view how did you spend your week in the perspective of achieving your OKR results. Even add resources for specific KRs. This helps you increase your knowledge base over a period of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>! Follow what you can maintain. Don’t overcomplicate :)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by Shalon van Tine</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Postmodernism: A Problem of the Left, or the Right?</em></strong></p>



<p>In his popular self-help book <em>12 Rules for Life</em> and on his personal website, psychologist Jordan Peterson argues that the “postmodernist left” has created a culture where all truth and morality is relative. Blaming the “dominance of postmodern Marxist rhetoric in the academy,” Peterson claims that political correctness and hostility towards men are the results of this so-called postmodernism. Peterson is not, of course, the first to accuse the left of promoting a postmodern agenda. In the 1980s, classicist Allan Bloom feared that left-leaning professors filled young minds “with a jargon derived from the despair of European thinkers, gaily repackaged for American consumption and presented as the foundation for a pluralistic society.” Following suit, conservative pundit Roger Kimball wrote that college students had become “committed to an ethic of cultural relativism,” and that “in order to realize the freedom that postmodernism promises, culture must be transformed into a field of arbitrary options.”<br>Even though conservatives characterized postmodernism as a problem with the left, the rise of “fake news” and media spectacle associated with Donald Trump caused left-leaning thinkers to depict postmodernism as a problem with the right. Literary critic Jeet Heer called Trump “America’s First Postmodern President,” saying that the president “is the product not just of a fluke election or a racist and sexist backlash, but the culmination of late capitalism.” Journalist Ryan Cooper argued that the politics of the right represented “a load of cynical gobbledygook,” and that “if there is any political faction that behaves like the most hysterically exaggerated caricature of postmodernism, it is the current Republican Party.”</p>



<p>That both sides of the political spectrum blame postmodernism for society’s ills points to an issue of definition. Postmodernism is not so much a problem of the left or the right, but rather, the problem lies in its vague terminology and the common theoretical misunderstandings associated with it. In other words, when the left or the right speaks of postmodernism, they usually mean different things. Postmodernism is better understood as an umbrella term that houses a wide range of political, economic, and aesthetic ideas under it. To get to the heart of postmodernism’s consequences, it is first necessary to take a step back and determine what postmodernism actually is.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Postmodernism and Its Relationship to Modernism</em></strong></p>



<p>As its name suggests, postmodernism is often considered the era that comes after modernism. Like postmodernism, modernism is a broad category that contains a collection of twentieth-century ideas, and it is replete with its own contradictions and varying perspectives. In some ways, postmodernism is a reaction against modernism, yet in other ways, postmodernism is an extension of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put simply, modernism refers to a collection of philosophies and artistic movements that sprouted up in response to the horrors of World War I. Its origins, however, go back a little earlier to the end of the nineteenth century when some key figures uprooted long-held paradigms. Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution is arguably the first major influence on modernist thought, as it demonstrated that humans were not divinely created, but were instead the product of a larger biological and ecological system. Fascinated by Darwin’s assertion that nature was dynamic, Friedrich Nietzsche contemplated the spiritual and philosophical consequences of such a world, and he concluded that the history of philosophy from Plato through Hegel had to be reconsidered when faced with the newfound reality of evolution. Similarly, Karl Marx criticized the idealist notions that dominated philosophy at the time and instead used Darwin’s concepts as the scientific basis for his materialist approach to history. And, also like Darwin, Sigmund Freud asserted that human action is shaped more by one’s environment and subconscious fears and desires rather than one’s conscious, rational thought as the Enlightenment philosophers had declared.&nbsp;</p>







<p><em>“Postmodernism is frequently referred to derogatorily, as if it is a kind of bad philosophy. But this accusation is not only vague—it makes an is/ought error: The postmodern theorists were mainly concerned with describing the current condition of the world, not telling people how to act.”</em></p>



<p>These four evangelists of modernism did not agree on everything, of course, but what is important about them collectively is that they all influenced modernist thought by displacing the enduring myths of the old world with modern ideas. The modern world was now one that could no longer depend on the institutions of the past (the Church, the State, the Individual), but one that could be explained in terms of a system (natural selection, the will to power, class struggle, the unconscious). Hence, at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth, artists and writers rejected tradition (as tradition was no longer justified) and embraced Ezra Pound’s modernist adage to “make it new.” As such, artists created impressionistic and surrealistic works, writers used a stream-of-consciousness technique, and composers broke free from standard tonality. But modernism was not just a change in style but a change in theme. As the most devastating conflict in human history up to that point (in part due to advanced military weaponry), World War I left many searching for larger truths but also skeptical about science and notions of progress. So the modernists simultaneously tried to explain the world through grand narratives, but they were also painfully aware of their limitations in doing so. It is in this tension that the key themes of modernism become apparent: a quest for universal truth or morality, a desire for clear-cut identities, a penchant for seriousness and distinctions between “high” and “low” culture, and an uneasy relationship with technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the end of World War II, most modernist movements had either faded away or evolved into different forms. The world had now become global, and the rise of mass media ushered in the age of mass culture. The amalgam of the mass media and the advertising industry dominated the postwar era, leading to a homogenization of culture propagated by what Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer termed the “culture industry.” These Frankfurt School theorists saw a real danger in the collapsing of serious art into marketable and easily digestible entertainment products not because they were elitists (as they are so often maligned), but because the culture industry posed a threat to both intellectual development and revolutionary potential. In other words, the culture industry pumps out cheap forms of entertainment intended to stimulate consumerism and pacify consumers so they will not rise up against the capitalist system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Frankfurt School theorists formed the field of study known as “critical theory,” which figures like Peterson incorrectly conflate with postmodern thought because of its focus on culture and power. But this error demonstrates a lack of understanding about the relationship between modernism and postmodernism. The critical theorists fit squarely into modernist thought: generally speaking, they combined Marxism and Freudianism, and their analyses of modernity are best seen as early <em>criticisms</em> of the postmodern world developing in front of them. Further, their analyses stemmed from a structuralist perspective, in the broadest sense of the term. Structuralism contends that human experience can be analyzed according to its relationship with an overarching structure. This relationship can be materialist (as in Marxism), symbolic or mythological (as in anthropology), linguistic, psychological, and so on. While structuralist approaches can vary, the main takeaway in this context is that they all rest on the notion that one can objectively analyze a coherent system. Postmodernist approaches, however, would break away from this framework and instead question the possibility or limitations of analyzing a system when one resides within it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is at this crossroads where modernism and postmodernism begin to inhabit distinct spheres. But “postmodernism” as an idea would only get more complicated. To properly define it, postmodernism must be divided into three different but related concepts: postmodernism as an aesthetic movement, postmodernism as a linguistic challenge, and postmodernism as a societal analysis and critique.&nbsp; →</p>

SSH authentication, remote code signing and password storage too. It’s worked
so well (and required such significant effort to get working) that I thought
I’d write about how I did it and what makes my approach secure.</p><p>GPG, or GnuPG – now in version 2.x implements the
<a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">OpenPGP</a> email encryption standard and allows the
use of hardware smartcards such as the Yubikey 5.</p><p>This guide is applicable to most Linux distribution and MacOS. I’m currently

interface software; <code>pcscd</code> and <code>scdaemon</code> on Ubuntu.</p><p>In order to use your Yubikey for everything in this article, it has to contain
the only copy of your GPG private keys; GPG must have the public parts and be
configured to use the Yubikey as an OpenPGP smartcard.</p><p>With OpenPGP/gnupg there are many different possible key topologies and crypto
settings. What you want will depend on what you need the configuration for.</p><h3 id="openpgp-setup">OpenPGP setup</h3><p>I recommend you follow this setup process in livecd session in order to
mitigate the risk of the private keys being intercepted by a bad actor before
they are copied to the yubikey.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>GnuPG2 classifies keys by their capability; you’ll notice (some of) the
characters <code>[CSEA]</code> alongside listed secret keys with GnuPG2. Whilst
fundamentally the private keys are just a number of bits, GnuPG2 can earmark
each key with one or more capabilities upon generation such that it can only
ever be used for the allocated purpose thereafter. The key capabilities are:
<code>[C]ertificaiton</code>, <code>[S]igning</code>, <code>[E]ncryption</code> and <code>[A]uthentication</code>.</p><p>As I understand, it is simply good cryptographic practice to have
single-purpose keys; you should not, for instance, use the same key to
authenticate as you should to encrypt. The reasoning behind this is presumably
to mitigate some kind of theoretical attack.</p><p>GnuPG2 historically has in interface designed for (unusual) humans, not
machines; until recently it was difficult to script. Since version 2.2, there
is an interface to generate and set up keys in non-interactive mode. As such I
created a script called
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/gpg-keygen">gpg-keygen</a>
to generate the following topology for you:</p><ol><li>One master key (<code>CS</code>) (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>S</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>E</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>A</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li></ol><p>To use it, run the script in an empty directory.

live session. GnuPG2 should then be able to load and use the keys, though
before use the private subkeys need to be moved to the Yubikey.</p><p>Now is a good time to change the default OpenPGP user and admin pin from
<code>123456</code> and <code>123435678</code> respectively.

time with the <strong>key</strong> command (1,2,3 respectively)</li><li>When a key is selected, run <code>keytocard</code> to copy the key to the
correct slot on the yuibkey (there are 3, one each for S,E,A)</li><li><code>save</code> then exit. If you don’t save, the private keys will persist
locally which defeats the purpose of using the yubikey.</li></ol><p>The private keys are now on your yubikey, and no longer exist in <code>~/.gnupg</code>.
The next step is to harvest the public parts of the key to initialise your
target machine.</p><p>In order to use your new identity on the target machine, you’ll need to import
the public keys and give the master key “ultimate trust.” This might sound odd,
but this means GPG will implicitly trust any sub-key certified by your master
key so you can use them.</p><p>I prefer a clean-room approach in this case to ensure that not private keys are
copied to the target machine; in addition it makes it clear what steps are
necessary to set up new machines, too. Bear in mind that if you use the
web-of-trust and intend to keep other peoples public keys in GnuPG, you’ll need
to transfer them separately.</p><p>To make GPG trust your master key ultimately, you’ll need to use the
<code>trusted-key</code> setting in <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>. On the live session, you’ll
notice a file called <code>gpg-keyid.txt</code> which contains your master key ID<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. You can
append it to your GPG config file with this scriptable example from my
dotfiles,
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L39">user-configuration-naggie.sh</a>:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
trusted-key 9D37503A7DA6F9B6

</code></pre><p>Of course you should substitute my key ID for yours.</p><p>Next, you’ll need to import the public portions of your newly generated keys.
These can be found in <code>gpg-pubkeys.asc</code> on the live session in ASCII-guarded
format. It was exported by my <code>gpg-keygen</code> script using <code>gpg2 --export --armor &gt; gpg-pubkeys.asc</code>.
The keys can be piped into <code>gpg2 --quiet --import</code> – see

to <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>. GnuPG2, by default, will use some relatively weak
ciphers presumably for the sake of compatibility.</p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-list-secret-keys.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5d406a02f9836d699e9ba5714912a814aca7e445/1dba8/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-list-secret-keys.png" width="522" height="316" alt="The resulting key topology loaded into GnuPG2.

    <p>Font rasterisation is, in the author’s opinion, one of the most
    interesting fields of computer science. If music is the subjective
    application of physics, then font rasterisation is almost
    certainly the subjective application of computer science. The
    purpose of this article is threefold: firstly, to provide an
    introduction into the various methods available to aid in the
    rasterisation process; secondly, to provide a critical analysis of
    these methods against the needs of desktop applications; and
    finally, to relate this analysis to free software.</p>
    <p>Figures, in the form of bitmap images, are used extensively

    sub-pixel rendering, this article is best viewed on an LCD

    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>Before we start exploring the various methods used in font
    rasterisation, it is important to first understand <em>why</em>
    rasterisation is so difficult. Why should rasterisation on a
    computer screen be any more complicated than on a printer? It all
    comes down to resolution. Or, more precisely, the number
    of <em>dots per inch</em> (DPI).</p>
    <p>Printers typically start at around 300 DPI, with 600 DPI not
    being uncommon. This means that for every inch (2.54cm), there are
    potentially 300+ individual dots. Fonts, however, are not measured
    in dots but instead in <em>points</em>: 1/72 of an inch. A direct
    consequence of this is that a specific font at 10pt will have the
    same <em>physical dimensions</em> irrespective of the DPI at which
    it is rasterised.</p>
    <p>Whereas printers have a relatively high DPI, computer screens
    are typically <em>assumed</em> to be at 96 DPI, over three times
    lower. Herein lies the difficulty with on-screen
    rasterisation. This is best illustrated with an example: Figure 1
    shows the letter ‘M’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 600, 300, and 96
    DPI, respectively. Looking at the figure, it is clear that 96 DPI
    is not sufficient to preserve the shape—or letter-form—of the
    glyph.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="137" height="55" alt="M at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/m-various-dpi.png"></p><p>Figure 1: How 10pt Times Roman looks at 600, 300, and 96
      DPI.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This phenomenon can be explained using <em>information
    theory</em>. Since glyphs contain information it is possible to
    view them as a signal comprised of various frequencies. The
    Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that in order to
    accurately reproduce a signal, the sampling rate needs to
    be <em>at least twice the maximum frequency of the
    signal</em>. Should the sampling rate be lower than this, then
    distortions—in the form of aliasing—will be introduced. In the
    case of rasterisation, the sampling rate corresponds directly to
    the DPI of the output device.</p>
    <p>An example of aliasing as a consequence of low DPI can be seen
    in Figure 2.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="249" height="12" alt="Aliasing at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 2: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI. Note how some stems
      are thicker than others, and how certain features are
      under-/over-emphasised.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Since it is clear that 96 DPI is insufficient for accurate
    rasterisation, we are left with two options. The first is to find
    a way of <em>increasing the effective sampling rate</em> of the
    device, while the second is to <em>reduce the frequency of the
    glyphs to allow the use of a lower sampling rate</em>. All of the
    methods presented in this article fall into one of these two
    categories.</p>
    <h2><a name="font-hinting">Font Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>One of the oldest and mostly widely used techniques for
    improving rasterisation quality is font hinting. Also known
    as <em>grid fitting</em>, hinting involves modifying the shape of
    glyphs in order to ensure they line up with the rasterisation
    grid. By distorting the glyph so that it is aligned with the pixel
    grid, the overall frequency is reduced. An example of font hinting
    can be seen in Figure 3.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="26" alt="Un-hinted vs hinted text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/hinting.png"></p><p>Figure 3: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI with (bottom) and
      without (top) hinting. Also note the differing widths between
      the hinted and un-hinted text.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The hinted text is much more consistent than its un-hinted
    counterpart. However, this consistency comes at the price of
    accuracy. An unavoidable consequence of warping glyphs to the
    rasterisation grid is that their dimensions change slightly. These
    small differences quickly add up over a line of text resulting in
    a visible difference—such as that seen in Figure 3. The author
    refers to this phenomenon as <em>character drift</em>.</p>
    <p>The degree of hinting required to produce consistent output is
    dependent on the DPI of the output device; low resolution devices
    require more aggressive hinting than high resolution device. One
    of the consequences of aggressive hinting—necessary as it may
    be—is character drift. At resolutions in excess of 300 DPI, it is
    possible to forego font hinting entirely.</p>
    <h3>Implementation details</h3>
    <p>Font hinting is usually achieved through one of two
    approaches. The first of these puts the font designer in control
    of the hinting process. This is the approach taken by the TrueType
    font specification—without a doubt the most widespread font
    format. In the specification, a virtual machine is used to
    instruct the rasteriser on how to go about rendering a
    glyph. This, in theory, gives designers <em>pixel level</em>
    control over how glyphs are rasterised at various
    sizes <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>. The second
    approach is to leave hinting up to the font rasteriser—so
    called <em>auto-hinting</em>. When rendering non-TrueType
    fonts—such as those in Adobe’s Type 1 format, or those that lack
    hinting instructions—this is often the only
    option <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>.</p>
    <p>In order for a meaningful comparison to be made between these
    approaches, it is first necessary to have an understanding of some
    of the other techniques available for improving rasterisation
    quality.</p>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing">Anti-aliasing</a></h2>
    <p>So far, we have been assuming that pixels are bi-level, either
    on or off, black or white. However, modern computer screens are
    capable of displaying millions of colours, including shades of
    grey. Font rasterisers are able to take advantage of this by using
    a technique called <em>anti-aliasing</em>. As the name would
    suggest, anti-aliasing is a means of avoiding the unwanted effects
    of aliasing when sampling a high-frequency signal on a
    low-frequency device. This is done by blurring the signal; its
    effect is to reduce its maximal frequency.</p>
    <p>Pixels of anti-aliased text are multi-level. That is, they can
    be black, white, or a shade of grey. The shade of a pixel depends
    on the percentage of the pixel that is <em>masked</em> by the
    glyph. This concept is neatly demonstrated in Figure 4.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="92" height="63" alt="Primitive anti-aliasing" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/g-anti-aliased.png"></p><p>Figure 4: The letter ‘g’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 672 DPI
      (left) and 96 DPI (right). The right glyph has been rendered
      with a (primitive) anti-aliasing algorithm and scaled by a
      factor of 7.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The effect of anti-aliasing on a line of text can be seen in
    Figure 5. Anti-aliasing does a very good job at preserving the
    shapes of glyphs. Moreover, the anti-aliased text does not suffer
    from character drift. However, this accuracy comes at the
    sacrifice of clarity—the anti-aliased text has a much lower
    contrast than its hinted counterpart.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="41" alt="A comparison of anti-aliased
      text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 5: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI; without
      anti-aliasing or hinting (top), with hinting (middle), with
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing-with-hinting">Combining Anti-aliasing
    With Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>Both hinting and anti-aliasing improve the legibility of text
    at low resolutions by making it more consistent. Hinting does this
    at the cost of <em>accuracy</em>, while anti-aliasing does it at
    the cost of <em>contrast</em>. At this point, the logical question
    to ask is “can hinting and anti-aliasing be used in conjunction
    with each other?” The answer is yes—with the appropriate finesse,
    it is possible to hint anti-aliased text.</p>
    <p>In principle, hinting anti-aliased text is exactly the same as
    hinting monochromatic text. However, in practice, a different
    implementation is required in order to produce high-quality
    output <cite><a href="#tur01b">Tur01b</a></cite>. The practicality
    of this depends on the hinting approach taken; it is significantly
    easier when the hinting is performed by the font rasteriser
    instead of a virtual machine. Indeed, naïvely combining TrueType
    hinting with anti-aliasing can often result in a <em>reduction in
    overall consistency</em>! This is most readily observed when
    rendering sans-serif fonts, as can be seen in Figure 6.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="263" height="43" alt="Hinting and anti-aliasing
      combined" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/bytecode-hinting-with-anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 6: 10pt Arial at 96 DPI; with TrueType hinting (top),
      with anti-aliasing (middle), with TrueType hinting and
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <p>While the output is legible, it lacks consistency—some
    characters, such as ‘w’ and ‘s’, are anti-aliased, while others,
    such as ‘l’, are not. This causes some characters to appear to be
    heavier than others. These heavier characters are often referred
    to as being <em>dirty</em>. The undesirable characteristics
    apparent in Figure 6 arise because the anti-aliased text is being
    hinted <em>as if it were regular monochromatic text</em>. (Which,
    incidentally, is why the application of anti-aliasing has no
    effect on the overall character drift.) But as was established in
    the previous section, anti-aliased text has a <em>lower
    frequency</em> than monochromatic text. The solution, therefore,
    is to use less aggressive hinting. This is quite difficult to

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>About GitOps and Terraform in general</h2><p><strong>GitOps</strong> describes the idea that every change to your infrastructure should start with a change in a Git repository. The Git repository is your one source of truth. By doing this, your team and you can jointly propose, agree on and make changes following the same popular pull-request based workflow that has proven invaluable for software development.</p><p>This of course requires, that your infrastructure configuration is described in a format that can be stored in Git and that changes can be automated.</p><p><strong>Terraform</strong> is the leading infrastructure as code solution. Using a declarative domain specific language (HCL) you can define your infrastructure as code. If any change to that infrastructure is needed, Terraform can plan the steps required to change the infrastructure from its current state to the new desired state based on the changes to the code in the repository. And with its remote state support, Terraform is able to do this in an automated way and prevent simultaneous changes from causing issues.</p><p>In theory, this means <strong>GitOps with Terraform</strong> should be straight forward. Simply set up a trigger to run Terraform commands from a CI/CD pipeline every time a change is made to the Git repository. But what seems simple in theory, often turns out to be slightly more complex in the real world.</p><h3>GitOps automation pitfalls</h3><p>There are three pitfalls to avoid to be able to trust your GitOps workflow with triggering automation that makes changes to your mission critical infrastructure.</p><ol><li>Ensure changes are reviewed and tested before they are applied to critical environments.</li><li>Prevent configuration drift between environments from rendering that security ineffective.</li><li>Integrate the GitOps workflow and the automation with the correct triggers and steps.</li></ol><h2>How the Kubestack framework can help</h2><p>What does framework mean in this context? Think of it as Kubestack is to GitOps infrastructure automation, what Spring Boot is to cloud native Java applications.</p><p>The Kubestack framework is designed to help platform teams hit the ground running and avoid common pitfalls the same way an application team benefits from starting with a framework like Spring Boot.</p><p>Application frameworks help with common application requirements, Kubestack helps with common GitOps infrastructure automation requirements.</p><p>So when web application frameworks for example help with request routing or user authentication, Kubestack is a framework that helps with GitOps infrastructure automation. As such it provides reusable Terraform modules for the clusters and surrounding infrastructure and <a href="https://www.kubestack.com/catalog">Kustomize bases for cluster services</a> required before application workloads can be deployed.</p><h3>Everything to get started</h3><p><strong>By starting with the Kubestack framework, platform teams don't just get reusable components. They get a proven, integrated implementation that avoids these common pitfalls.</strong></p><p>Kubestack uses two infrastructure environments called ops-environment and the apps-environment. The purpose of the ops-environment is to validate changes, before they are promoted to the critical apps-environment. Both environments are configured using <a href="https://www.kubestack.com/framework/documentation/inheritance-model">inheritance to avoid configuration drift</a>, which would risk rendering the validation ineffective. The environments and inheritance model fully integrates both infrastructure configuration and Kubernetes cluster services.</p><p>Kubestack's <a href="https://www.kubestack.com/framework/documentation/gitops-process">GitOps workflow</a> is designed to provide reliable automation for teams to jointly maintain clusters and services. It allows teams to:</p><ol><li>Peer review planned infrastructure changes,</li><li>and validate these changes against the ops-environment</li><li>before they are promoted to the critical apps-environment.</li></ol><h3>Designed to be extendable</h3><p>Kubestack is built using Terraform modules and providers. This means Kubestack fully integrates with the entire Terraform ecosystem. Teams have the ability to build upon the framework, extend their infrastructure to meet their specific requirements and integrate it into the wider organization's architecture.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <p>It is the fifth time that I try to reboot this exact blog, and no doubt this is the most successful attempt, I have consecutive 12 posts written, including this one. But all previous attempts failed, only 3 articles in 7 years, and years ago I have even shut down this blog for a long period. I can’t recall what makes me this decision of closing blog, maybe most posts are programming related and become obsolete because technology evolves fast.</p>

<p>However, I decided to reboot my blog and written <a href="https://vec.io/posts/those-lost-years">an article to summarize past years</a>. That time I also removed the Google Analytics tracking code because I was never that naive boy who would trust a monopoly any more. The analytics from cloudflare still make me shocked that my old blog have about 200 unique daily visitors, and dramatically increased to about 1,000 this time when I started writing every day. And my visitors are also very diverse in countries.</p>

<p><img src="https://vec.io/images/2020/06/27/blog-visitors.png" alt="blog visitors"></p>

<p><img src="https://vec.io/images/2020/06/27/blog-countries.png" alt="blog countries"></p>

<p>But that’s almost the only article for that reboot, I ask myself what prevented me from writing in those previous reboots,  were there any obstacles? I don’t think so. What differed this time from previous ones? I can come up with nothing, because this time I even begin with a similar post <em>“<a href="https://vec.io/posts/hello-world-again">Hello World Again</a>“</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe decisions will only work if you make them many times, make the same decision again and again, until you can finally put your efforts in. I always decide to write because I believe writing is a skill, and a skill would be improved a lot if practiced enough times. Programming is the first skill that I’m confident I’m in some top levels, which I don’t think come as a gift, it’s after hundreds of thousands of lines of code.</p>

<p>After writing 12 posts continuously every day, I have felt much easier to organize ideas and publish it faster. Another improvement is that I’m capable of expressing opinions instead of plain technology tutorials only.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="inner_content-74-2180"><section id="section-2-306"><div><div id="inner_content-3-306">
<p>[In less than 30 days my wife and I are packing up our few belongings and driving up into Colorado, Utah, and/or Montana. We haven’t decided where yet, but we’re going to be renting somewhere, exploring places to live longer-term. Below is my vague dream vision motivating this migration adventure. If you’re interested in these ideas and want to chat via email or you live in these areas and want to have a drink, <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/contact/">you should message me</a>.]</p>



<p>This pandemic lockdown is making me think extra hard about where, with whom, and how I want to live.</p>



<p>I suspect I’m not the only one.</p>



<p>It just so happens that, when the lockdown struck, I was (and still am) living with my wife and two friends in a spacious home that my friends own in New Mexico. I suspect that the discomfort and inconvenience we are experiencing is drastically less than average, because we're locked up with other smart and interesting people.</p>



<p>It also just so happens that, a year ago, I <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/tag/jumping-ship/">jumped ship</a> from a traditional career in a brick-and-mortar institution for an unorthodox career based on the internet. This is the other reason why the pandemic lockdown has been relatively pleasant and productive for me.</p>



<p>My wife and I find ourselves thinking more creatively than ever about how, exactly, we’ll choose to settle down. I’m 33, my wife is 29. We don’t have kids yet but we really want to have one soon. In my post-academic transition, we’re still a bit below median income for a married couple, but growth looks good and now my upside is unlimited so I’m pretty confident.</p>



<p>The inaccessibility of traditional home ownership for many Millennials is another factor that will intersect with the pandemic-induced appetite for lifestyle innovation.</p>



<p>There are many ways you could imagine young adults architecting arrangements far superior to their status quo. Personally, just to get the discussion going, I suspect the ideal collective unit will be both <em>federated</em> (autonomous units with a council) and <em>digital:</em> </p>



<ul><li>Money comes primarily from high-leverage internet work</li><li>Internal governance processes automated to the max, minimizing politics</li></ul>



<p>I think the ideal would be a very large property (~50 acres) somewhere cheap but beautiful (Appalachia? Montana?), with multiple independent households in a federal governance structure. Communal houses are just not attractive to most intelligent and high-functioning people. People just like privacy, and control. Also communal houses are not robust because one bad apple can rapidly ruin the whole bunch. My “federated town” model gives every family complete autonomy and privacy, except for whatever mutual obligations are decided. But multiple properties, like in the traditional suburb, provide only the weakest incentives for communal investment. When every household owns an equity stake in one property, you lock in the real forces of real community (if the ship goes down, everyone goes down).</p>



<p>Let’s run the numbers on a hypothetical scenario. As I wrote about previously, there was recently up for sale <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/on-reality-patchwork-and-neo-feudal-techno-communism/">a whole town in the state of Georgia.</a> It cost $1.7 million.</p>



<p>First, have a look at this video of what comes with our purchase of Tombsboro. Keep in mind this is only an example we’re using to fix ideas; there are actually many abandoned towns all over the USA, so exact location could be negotiated. But seriously, how cool is this?</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Toomsboro Promotional Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7JYCo6ZeR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In that video, I tallied <em>at least</em> 15 buildings suitable for stand-alone, private, family homes. And that’s being very conservative, because I’m not even counting the hotel and bank and such! Let’s be even more conservative for maximum planning realism and assume we could only have 10 families living here.</p>



<p>If we obtained a 30-year mortgage at a 3% interest rate, we could expect monthly payments of about $7,167. And assuming a 20% down payment we would need $340k up front. An abandoned ghost town might need a little work, but I’m assuming the initial group would be intrepid with modest needs and we could do it fixer-upper style after we move in and over time. So let’s just increase that figure by a completely made-up amount and say we’d need $500k up front to buy a ghost town and make it livable enough for 10 not-insane adults to tolerate it. Then we’d need to pay $7,167 every month, starting immediately.</p>



<p>First, let’s solve the down payment. Either the initial group is moderately wealthy people (~10 households each of which have $50k lying around), or a few are quite wealthy (~4 people each have about $125k lying around), or everyone is like me or poorer (I have about $20k liquid) and the rest we make up with private investment from the few kind and visionary readers of my blog who occasionally tell me they want to invest (I usually just say no thanks because I don’t really need or want capital, but after you receive a few of these offers you start to think about what you could do with it). 10 families each with $20k to invest would require an additional $300k to set-up shop in our ghost town. I’m not sure but my gut feeling is that if I found 10 responsible households that were seriously ready to roll, I could scrape together $300k investment from my personal networks on the internet. If only because it’s crazy enough that it would get a ton of buzz, which would bring a lot of people out of the woodwork.</p>



<p>Next, how are we going to pay $7,167/month and have enough to regularly improve and maintain the town? It’s easy to think of many plausible schemes that could work at some point (e.g. rent rooms in the hotel) but honestly I’d rather not count on anything at all speculative.</p>



<p>The easiest and most fail-proof way to solve this problem is to have 10 households that already have a good, stable income through remote work.</p>



<p>This is another reason why the pandemic is a game changer. The number of people who meet this requirement just increased to… everybody. And even if you think post-pandemic workplace norms revert 90% back to pre-pandemic norms (unlikely in my view), that’s still thousands of new people who could potentially do what I’m envisioning. Think about how many smart and productive, married Millenial couples there must be, wanting to have their first baby but postponing because their professional work requires them to live somewhere too expensive and too atomized to build a family. The employers of these couples formerly believed that face-to-face interaction was necessary; they are now learning it is not, and remote workers are cheaper. Thus, when the pandemic is over there will be at least a few thousand Millenial married couples who have both the resources and the newfound freedom to build the community of their dreams. I only need to find 9 of them!</p>



<p>$7,167/month split among 10 households is only $716 a month! Obviously you’d have to add for interest paid to investors, add for developing the properties, add for taxes and a bunch of other things. But as a starting figure, that aint’ bad!</p>



<p>No point getting more specific since these are extremely rough estimates. But remember, I handicapped the estimates very conservatively. You could fit way more people in a whole town; find a cheaper town; luck out with a donor instead of an investor—many ways this could turn out easier and better than I estimate here. As a back-of-the-napkin exercise, it’s enough to convince me something like this is very possible.</p>



<p>The real bottleneck is not financial, I suspect. It’s psychological and sociological. Are there 10 smart, capable, married couples who are weird enough to try something like this? Historically, no. But historically we’ve never been constrained to our neighborhood for weeks on end… And historically 30-year-olds already own homes and have babies. So maybe now is when the truly smart and truly capable Millennials realize their holistic life prospects look much better as desperados...</p>



<p>Personally, if there was a viable opportunity to settle down into a weird and novel lifestyle arrangement that might be risky in some regards but highly anti-fragile to catastrophic threats, my wife and I are probably more favorably disposed than we’ve ever been. By “viable opportunity” I just mean actual, capable people who seem cool, in my inbox, seriously interested in figuring out something like this.</p>



<p>By the way I’m not saying I would never do this with single people, and no disrespect to single people. It’s just that I’m married so it would make the most sense for everyone else to be married.</p>



<p>I’m guessing we’re not the only ones who think about this kind of stuff. A few other data points here… <a href="https://indiethinkers.org/">IndieThinkers.org</a> now has a notable contingent of people interested in, or already working on, unorthodox lifestyle designs. I’ve also been contacted by at least three people in the past few months who expressed — unsolicited — a desire to invest financially in some kind of collective project related in some way to lifestyle design. A recent edition of my <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/newsletter/">Signs of Life</a> newsletter was entitled, “<a href="https://ckarchive.com/b/d0ueh0h80qd0">If I bought 8 studio apartments, would you visit?</a>” I got a few replies saying yes… Also, the success of Based Mansion seems to <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/review-of-based-mansion/">further validate</a> the hypothesis of high interest in — and the financial viability of — seemingly weird IRL arrangements.</p>



<p>I know that there’s always been widespread romantic interest in such things; my argument is only that the pandemic may, at the margin, kick some people from the romantic-dreamer category into the fuck-it-let’s-go category.</p>



<p>If anything in this post resonates with you, <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/contact/">you should at least say hi</a>. My wife and I are just crazy enough to really consider something like this…</p>

New research from scientists at the University of California, Davis suggests that traffic-related air pollution also significantly alters brain growth and development.</p><p>Previous research links air pollution to neurodevelopmental disorders <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/air-pollution-may-increase-autism-risk-78-percent-children/" target="_blank">such as autism</a>. Yet few studies examine precisely how air pollution affects brain development, and how these changes may lead to abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p><h2>Rat model reveals red flags</h2><p>To determine how traffic-related air pollution impacts brain development, UC Davis researchers set up a rat housing facility next to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/daily-exposure-traffic-noise-increase-obesity-risk/" target="_blank">busy traffic</a> tunnel in Northern California. They then exposed one group of rat pups to polluted air from the tunnel, and another group of rat pups to filtered air that was free of pollutants.</p><p>“This approach was a creative way to get at the question of what impacts air pollution has on the brain in the absence of confounding factors such as socioeconomic influences, diet, etc.,” lead researcher Pamela Lein explains in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/air-quality-impacts-early-brain-development" target="_blank">media release</a>. “It’s important to know if living close to these roadways poses a significant risk to the developing human brain.”</p><p>After exposing the rat pups to either polluted or filtered air, the researchers compared the brains from each group. They found that rat pups exposed to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/pollution-rush-hour-traffic/" target="_blank">traffic-related air pollution</a> had abnormal brain growth and increased neuroinflammation. In particular, they point to abnormal cell growth in a region of the brain known as the hippocampus, which plays a critical role in learning and memory.</p><h2>Air pollution and abnormal brain development</h2><p>These findings are notable for several reasons. First, the majority of previous air pollution studies have looked at the effects of concentrated air pollution <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/office-hazards-inhaling-printer-toner-may-cause-genetic-metabolic-changes/" target="_blank">particles</a> or diesel exhaust. Both of these are components of air pollution, but do not mimic the complexity of real-world air pollution exposures. By collecting air from a highly trafficked tunnel, the UC Davis researchers created a realistic air pollution exposure scenario.</p><p>Second, the researchers found abnormal brain development when air pollution levels were within current regulatory limits. This finding suggests that low levels of air pollution have the potential to negatively impact brain development.</p><p>“What we witnessed are subtle changes,” first author Kelley Patten explains. “But we are seeing these effects using air pollution exposures that fall within regulatory limits. With the backdrop of other environmental and genetic risk factors in humans, this may have a more pronounced effect. This exposure also contains very fine particulate matter that isn’t currently regulated.”</p><p>In the future, the researchers hope to determine which components of <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-pollution" target="_blank">air pollution</a> are responsible for the neurodevelopmental effects they observed.</p><p>“We have managed to build a unique and talented team and taken advantage of our built environment to bring us closer than we’ve been before to achieving these objectives,” says co-author Keith Bein. “Increasingly, these types of efforts are required to continue advancing the field, thereby informing policymakers and stakeholders about how best to protect human health.”</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0845-3" target="_blank">study</a> is published in <i>Translational Psychiatry.</i></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/StudyFindsorg/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Like studies?

Under the Rain-Making Control Act (1967) you are advised that it is an offence to <a href="http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/ltobjst8.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/9D788B5BB4776F24CA257C3100008D44/$FILE/67-7637aa016%20authorised.pdf" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>"carry out unauthorised rain-making operations"</u></a>. </p><p id="viewer-5hc95">Getting a measure of how many laws there are in Australia is not easy, but one practitioner's resource <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/products/the-laws-of-australia/" target="_top" rel="noopener"><em><u>The Laws of Australia</u></em></a> proudly lists over 40,000 legal propositions across 320 specific topics and 36 broad topic areas. Despite the legal maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse, it is clear that it is impossible for even an interested reader to have a full and complete knowledge of the law - let alone a disinterested reader. </p><p id="viewer-eodrf">In the Design of Everyday Things, Donald Norman describes two crucial principles for a useful object: <em>Discoverability</em> and <em>Understanding</em>. It should be easy to learn how an object works, and clear to see how to use it. For the vast majority of laws, this is not the case: a typical Act may run for many hundreds of pages, define case-specific jargon, refer to rules set out in external pieces of legislation, involve ambiguities, internal inconsistencies, or simply poor writing (the 528 page <a href="https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2001-071" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>Duties Act in Queensland</u></a> is a prime example).</p><p id="viewer-8n06i">In part, this is nature of the beast: the administrative structure for a law to be changed is a complicated and multi-staged affair, involving a parliament which will not seek to amend a law unless it serves for political capital. Repairing cracks in the sidewalk is necessary, but it's nothing you want to turn into a press statement. As a result law is updated only sporadically, and often in response to the most vocal and focal failures rather than being optimised. </p><p id="viewer-ekgl9">There are moves to improve this process. One of the more interesting is being led by the CSIRO <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/en/Our-Research/Our-Work/Future-Cities/Optimising-service-delivery/RaaP" target="_top" rel="noopener"><em><u>Regulation as a Platform</u></em></a><em> </em>project which recommends converting regulatory rules into machine readable logic which can be quickly checked for internal consistency, and clearer ways this may communicated to the public or automated for simple administrative tasks. Advances in natural language processing may additionally aid in users being able to ask for clarification for a legal rule, and receive general advice from a machine.</p><p id="viewer-ci8o1">The idea <a href="https://theconversation.com/csiro-wants-our-laws-turned-into-computer-code-heres-why-thats-a-bad-idea-130131" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>has received pushback</u></a> due to concern that an algorithmic approach to law removes the human element and the role of discretion. Moreover the stink of Robodebt scandal makes some leery of outsourcing application of the law too far to machines. However the idea has some merit - not only in terms of directly using new tools for searching or interpreting the law; but also conceptually, using programming concepts to better understand how law may be better designed to run efficiently and user-friendly. </p><p id="viewer-dlmsk">In many ways a law is a program which runs on society rather than on circuits: wet, squishy humanware rather than hardware. It involves a system of logic and operation. Functions which are defined and acted upon in a systematic order, with constraints provided which restrict the operation of a system. The analogy is particularly clear for administrative law applied by rote. However, it also applies for laws which require the application of discretion or decision-making (the decision maker is simply a sub-operation requiring a person). </p><p id="viewer-6vdkf">In code, there is the concept of algorithmic efficiency - how resources (time and storage) vary with the size of an operation. This is measured by reference to the cost of a base operation (e.g. adding up two numbers, or plucking out an item from a list). The common measure is the worst case running time: a constant operation <em>O(1)</em> runs the same time no matter the size of the input; a linear operation <em>O(N) </em>runs as the sum of the base operations; and polynomial operations [e.g. <em>O(N^2)</em>],<em> </em>and exponential operations [e.g. <em>O(2^N)</em>] run increasingly less efficiently with the size of the input. Designing an efficient algorithm is understandably a goal for a good program that will run fast and easily with little overhead. </p><p id="viewer-dshb6">In principle the idea of algorithmic complexity also applies to law. Here we have additional forms of resources: costs of implementation (the cost of administrative public servants), costs of interpretation (the cost of understanding the law, e.g. employing external legal advice, reading legislation, or checking informal explainers), and costs in terms of error correction (the judicial system, including the many barriers to entry). While less tangible, these are similar to those borne by computers in algorithmic complexity: they represent the cost of resources required to run a particular process, which may be comprised of many smaller processes or required actions. </p><p id="viewer-4kiqo">As a result programming principles can be applied to make law more efficient and user-friendly. The aim is to minimise the total costs of operation while sufficiently achieving the desired legal aim. Looking at the regular individual operations involved in a procedure, including complex, expensive, or repeated operations, is the first step in improving the efficiency of a law. Beyond thinking about law in terms of algorithmic complexity, there are a number of core programming techniques that lend themselves to direct analogies in legal design. Many of the rules outlined in The Pragmatic Programmer (outline <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-se/teaching/K-CCD-2014/Pragmatic-Programmer-summary.pdf" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>) are directly applicable - particularly ideas around orthogonality (reducing cross-dependencies), maintaining single unambiguous definitions, and building in exception handling are all good concepts. </p><p id="viewer-1pb16">It's no coincidence that the authors of The Pragmatic Programmer turned to legal analogies when outlining concepts for programmers. As is often the case when two fields share conceptual links learnings from the two domains can flow in both directions, and legal professionals and policy designers would be advised to learn and take from design techniques in computer science where they can. </p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

Well, it started off as just what it is.</p><p>A group of us changed our Twitter names to include <span>👁👄👁"</span> because we thought it was a funny trend from TikTok. People started noticing the change on their timelines, noting the creepiness of the emojis in particular. For a brief period of time, everyone who added the emojis to their name was added to a giant Twitter group conversation. From there, things unfolded.</p><p>What started out as a meme in our small group chat grew bigger than we ever imagined. So we thought about how to make use of the hype cycle we’d stumbled upon. But honestly, we didn’t have to think too hard: in this moment, there’s pretty much no greater issue to amplify than the systemic racism and anti-Blackness much of the world is only beginning to wake up to. We’re excited that we could use our newfound platform to drive action towards a few causes that are doing important work towards racial justice: <a href="https://thelovelandfoundation.org/loveland-therapy-fund/">Loveland Foundation Therapy Fund</a>,<a href="https://www.theokraproject.com/">The Okra Project</a>,<a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project</a>, and others.</p><p>We’ve done pretty well for a non-existent product. <span>👁👄👁.fm</span> was the top product of the day on Product Hunt (Theranos who?). The website accumulated 20,000 email signups and thousands of tweets sharing the link. We were covered in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/face-emoji-twitter-it-is-what-it-is-promo-a9587351.html">The Independent</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2020/06/26/what-is--oh-it-is-what-it-is/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">Forbes</a>. We got shoutouts from <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/what-does-mean-well">Josh Constine</a> and <a href="https://wfh.substack.com/p/the-6-builders-who-will-thrive-in">Brianne Kimmel</a>. Some folks on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/hg26ip/whats_the_deal_with_this_it_is_what_it_is_app/">Reddit</a> puzzled over who we were. <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1276585276626726913?s=20">Andrew Chen</a> of Andreessen Horowitz, <a href="https://twitter.com/shannonpurser/status/1276631647157235712">Shannon Purser</a> of Stranger Things, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1276418907968925696">Elon Musk</a> may have subtweeted us? The <a href="https://twitter.com/itiseyemoutheye">@itiseyemoutheye</a> Twitter and accounts of our teammates were inundated with invite requests. Most importantly, we raised over $65,000 in donations from people who signed up for our email list. Two anonymous donors have agreed to match the first $60,000 and $75,000, bringing the total to $200,000. We would love to work with anyone else who wants to match. Please DM us! </p>In a strange way, this sort of became an anti-statement against what we’d all seen on tech Twitter. We’re a <a href="https://xn--mp8hai.fm/demographics.png">diverse</a>, ragtag group of young technologists tired of the status quo tech industry, and thought that we could make the industry think a bit more about its actions. Despite calls-to-action like that “<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>” essay we’ve all read, most of the industry (from product teams to VC) still stays obsessed with exclusive social apps that regularly ignore — or even silence — real needs faced by marginalized people all over the world, and exclude these folks from the building process. As an industry, we need to do better.<p>We sincerely thank you for spreading the word and donating to these important causes. In conclusion, it is what it is: a meme that leveraged the relentless hype of exclusive apps and redirected it towards a critical social need. Thank you, and remember that unlike <span>👁👄👁</span>, #BlackLivesMatter and other social movements aren't trends or hype cycles. Let’s keep giving back as best as we can.</p><p>Signed,</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/itiseyemoutheye/following">The 👁👄👁 Team</a></p><p><a href="https://shop.itiswhatitis.fm/">We do have merch though.</a><br>All proceeds are donated to organizations that support Black lives.</p></article></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="783e">Railway time was the first joint element that united India. Madras/Chennai was the first place to transmit time to entire India.</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/413ad-0wpivc8ss5r3ztwoj.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Indian Railway.Source-Financial express</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I’m always fascinated by the way my dad conveyed time. He prefers the 24 hours format. Many of his friends use the same, but in other walks of life in India, people stick to the 12hr time format. My dad worked in Indian railways, and in many parts of India, a 24 hours format came to be known as Railway Time. How did it the 24-hour format got the name railway time, and who gave India time? Let’s ponder on that question.</p>



<h2 id="c26f">Asia’s first-time zone:</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/2fd24-0gbrmluypyr0km7jb.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Madras Observatory.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The need to have a standard time zone was the need due to Industrialisation. Prominent Astronomers across the world gathered in the USA for the World Meridian conference to conclude the center of the earth for timezone definition in 1884. The astronomers agreed that Greenwich, where British astronomical society is located will be the centerline for the time zone. Countries will calculate their time based on Greenwich meridian.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/e08af-0h_a52u42pru5n1cy.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>John Goldingham working. Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>British India set up a survey office in Nungambakkam, Madras to gather data on the landscape around Madras(Modern day Chennai). John Goldingham was the first Astronomer to land in Chennai and set up the first metrological station in Asia in Madras in 1742. He mapped the stars to set Madras at 80° 17’21 “E. He predicted India is 51/2 hours ahead of GMT. The time zone was fixed as Madras’s time probably the first Asian official timezone. His successor Thomas Glanville Taylor mapped 11,000 stars and published “Madras Catalog.”</p>



<p>As Industrialization gripped India, it was the need of the hour to keep uptime. Indian railways started to connect the nook and corner of India. Indian railways had three time zones, namely Bombay/Mumbai time zone, Calcutta/Kolkatta time zone, and Madras/Chennai time zone. After a few years, Madras’s time was adopted as Indian railways official time as Madras observatory had a telegraph office that can synchronize time across India. Also, Madras’s time was the closest to GMT. The Madras Merdian is marked by a granite pillar that stands to this day in the spot. The small telegraph office in Madras controlled the time of entire India until independence.</p>



<h2 id="b907">Railway time:</h2>



<p>Indian railways weaved across Indian culture and were part and parcel of everyday activity for millions of Indians. When Indian railways adopted standard time, it took the time with it throughout India. Divided by 567 princely states which even the British can’t penetrate, Indian railways brought them together at the same time. Most railway employees like my dad speak in 24 hours format as they are used to it. Madras’s time was the official time of India until independence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are some of the common myths about Patents and Trademarks in startups.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have a startup idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>It’s natural to feel defensive about our <a href="https://hitstartup.com/startup-ideas-vs-problems/" target="_blank">startup idea</a>, but patents are for invention/innovation and not for a startup idea; even if we get nightmares about <a href="https://hitstartup.com/faang-will-steal-my-idea/" target="_blank">FAANG stealing our startup idea</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-an-innovative-app-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have an innovative app idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>Most countries don’t allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200213051434/https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/software_patents_fulltext.html" target="_blank">patent for a software</a>. Economic theories, methods of doing business, mathematical methods or computer programs&nbsp;as such&nbsp;are not patentable inventions in several countries.</p><h3 id="my-patent-attorney-said-they-are-patentable">My patent attorney said they are patentable</h3><p>Did you read all the clauses in the agreement you signed with your patent attorney? The decision to award a patent to an invention/innovation lies solely with the patent examiner of the country. By the time a patent application is filed, till it comes to examination, several years and thousands of dollars would have been spent.</p><p>Although ethically, a patent attorney should explicitly convey their doubts on patentability of an invention, few rarely do. Even when Prior Art Search(Searching for conflicting patents) is conducted by the patent attorney, they are not always successful in bringing up the conflicting patents because our patent application is not drafted yet.</p><p>But, when the Govt. patent examiner does the Prior Art Search while examining our patent application, they will likely find conflicting patents if it exists.</p><h3 id="i-have-paid-my-patent-attorney-explained-my-invention-now-all-i-have-to-do-is-just-sit-tight-for-a-patent">I have paid my patent attorney, explained my invention, now all I have to do is just sit tight for a patent</h3><p>An average patent attorney drafts patent for anything from innovation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet" target="_blank">bidet</a> to quantum computers, so they are experts in using language to define an invention but they are rarely an expert in any field of invention.</p><p>So, this requires utmost care from the inventor to work along with the patent drafter to articulate their invention with appropriate vocabulary.</p><p>Unfortunately, patent attorneys tend to force the inventor to not to be specific in describing their invention in the patent application in order to exploit the loop holes in patent examination; This may help in getting the patent, but it also enables someone else to exploit the same loop holes to file a patent for the copy of our invention by just changing the grammar/vocabulary because our patent was too generic.</p><h3 id="i-have-filed-for-a-patent-no-one-would-copy-my-innovation-invention">I have filed for a patent, no one would copy my innovation/invention</h3><p>Examination of patent takes several years, although in the meantime we could use ‘patent-pending’ tag if our patent application gets published, finding someone who is copying our invention takes proactive approach. If the copied invention is being applied for patent, we need to detect it from published journal of the patent office and raise a concern.</p><p>All these takes extraordinarily focused effort and budget.</p><h3 id="i-have-applied-for-a-patent-via-pct-i-will-receive-patent-for-all-countries">I have applied for a patent via PCT, I will receive patent for all countries</h3><p><a href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/" target="_blank">PCT - Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> simplifies the process of applying for a patent in several countries who are part of the PCT treaty, but the process of obtaining a patent depends upon the individual country’s patent laws.</p><p>Even during filing PCT, the second phase i.e. national phase involves filing documents for patent application in the respective individual countries requiring working with the patent attorney’s of those countries resulting in thousands of dollars of expense for each country we wish to apply for via PCT.</p><p>We can extrapolate the same process for patent examination in each of those countries.</p><p>Then there are certain countries which even while being part of the PCT, doesn’t enforce patent protection for inventions of other countries in order to protect their local businesses which copies our invention.</p><h3 id="i-have-received-my-patent-it-would-prevent-someone-from-copying-my-invention">I have received my patent, it would prevent someone from copying my invention</h3><p>Like any law, existence of a law doesn’t prevent someone from violating it; enforcement and judicial process should uphold that law. Similarly, existence of patent doesn’t prevent someone from copying our invention.</p><p>We need to find the violator, pursue an often lengthy and expensive judicial process to claim our right to the invention protected by the patent.</p><h3 id="i-m-the-inventor-in-the-patent-i-can-do-anything-with-it">I’m the inventor in the patent, I can do anything with it</h3><p>Unless the inventor in the patent is the owner of the patent, the inventor has no right to the patent. This is often the case when businesses file patents, where the business is the owner in the patent and the employee is the inventor in the patent.</p><h3 id="patents-are-only-for-protecting-my-invention">Patents are only for protecting my invention</h3><p>The main reason to protect the invention is to reap the value of the invention if needed. Patents offer commercial and strategic value to businesses.</p><p>So, patents are often used for trading them for money or for other patents in organizations apart from using it for protecting their inventions.</p><h3 id="patents-make-me-look-cool">Patents make me look cool</h3><p>Not necessarily, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/new-low-bad-patent-patent-troll-sues-ventilator-company" target="_blank">patent trolls</a> have left a bad taste in the inventor/innovator community; so much so that many are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIihrcqJYA" target="_blank">choosing not to file patent for their invention</a>.</p><p>Expenses, effort, lengthy unfair judicial trials has made several startups to not pursue patent for their invention in favor of capital efficiency.</p><h3 id="open-source-projects-doesn-t-need-patents">Open-source projects doesn’t need patents</h3><p>Open-source projects might need patents to <a href="https://golang.org/PATENTS" target="_blank">protect itself from getting sued for patent infringement</a>. Open-source projects protected by patents can prevent large organizations from stealing our project <a href="https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/" target="_blank">without due credit</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-product-name-i-need-to-trademark-it">I have a startup/product name, I need to trademark it</h3><p>Unless the startup/product has created value for its customers, so that a counterfeiter is using that startup/product name for forgery; trademarks for startup/product names are useless. Besides, in most countries just <a href="https://hitstartup.com/when-to-register-our-startup/" target="_blank">incorporating/registering our startup as a company</a> would prevent anyone else from using the same name for their company.</p><h3 id="trademark-automatically-applies-to-the-name-and-the-logo">Trademark automatically applies to the name and the logo</h3><p>Trademarking the name and logo are separate process namely wordmark and device mark respectively. Device mark might include text when it’s alongside the logo.</p></div></div>]]>

My husband &amp; I just finish a 3 week trek from Arizona all around New Mexico &amp; back to AZ without a plan. We stayed at 3 different Vineyards which all 3 took our breath away &amp; the owners we absolutely accommodating. We also stayed at an alpaca farm &amp; that was amazing!!!! The owners were sooo nice and the alpaca were so cute. It was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend HH to RV'ers.”</p><p>“Last summer I went from Toronto to Houston staying mainly at HH. Incuded an orchard, a museum, a winery, a distillery, a golf course (my old home course), and another winery. In the middle I enjoyed a State Park stay to change out and charge up my water and electrical systems. A lot of fun and met very interesting and helpful people. Also added a few bottles to my collection. Well done and thank you to HH. You make RVing fun.”</p><p>“Thanks to our hosts Dave and Diane for a wonderful shaded spot to spend our evening. Upon arrival Diane greeted and invited us for a wine tour by Meg who was very knowledgable and explained much of the local history including Bacon’s Castle and Hog Island. Dave joined us and took us on an extended tour of the farm and wine making facility. The goats entertained us with their antics of climbing the goat tower getting ready to retire for the evening. After having a large lunch earlier that day we opted for a simple dinner of baggette, cheese, snacks and Hampton Roads Winery wine purchased from their shop. The next day we took Meg’s suggestion and visited Bacon’s Castle followed by lunch at Surry Seafood. We also took a few bottles of Bacon’s Castle Red and other wines home with us. Our first Host experience was very positive! Many thanks!”</p></blockquote><p>Plenty of our blogging friends who have tried Harvest Hosts say that it’s well worth the small price ($67.15 with <a href="http://harvesthosts.refr.cc/pamela1">this discount</a>) in order to park their RV at picturesque locations and meet great people from around the country.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592277004447_16361"><div><h2>How Does Harvest Hosts work</h2><p>Here’s a review of how Harvest Hosts works:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Sign up for a membership. <a href="http://harvesthosts.refr.cc/pamela1">Click here to get 15% discount off your first year using our referral link</a>.</p></li><li><p>After signing up and registering as a new user, log in to your account.</p></li><li><p>In your account, you’ll see a map with all of the participating locations, as well as the restrictions and requirements for each location.</p></li><li><p>Reach out to a host you would like to stay with and ask them about their availability and if they can host you. </p></li><li><p>Your host will let you know if they’re available on the date your requesting and any other details.

June 26, 2020 | https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/04/sudo-1.9-accessing-terminal-data-from-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/04/sudo-1.9-accessing-terminal-data-from-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Sudo 1.9 is now feature complete. One of the new features is Python support, meaning that you can easily extend sudo functionality using Python scripts. It supports the very same APIs as the regular C plugin API, only the language is different. One of the more interesting APIs is the IO logging API, which provides access to terminal data in real-time, both input and output. This way you can check if a sudo user is accessing data that he should not, or analyze the commands entered and terminate a session before a disaster occurs.
In this blog you will find two simple examples for the above use cases. Both are over simplified but functional. You can use them to test out the new functionality, or as a basis for your own code.</p>

<p>In order to test sudo’s Python support, you will need both the sudo 1.9.0 package and the new sudo-python package.  Sudo binary packages are available for many platforms, but the sudo-python package is currently only distributed for Linux.  If you are using a different platform you will need to compile sudo yourself. It has a few dependencies, but the process is relatively easy and straightforward. I described it for RHEL / CentOS in my <a href="https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/01/whats-new-in-sudo-1.9-python/">previous blog</a> in depth. In addition to the version number, another important thing has changed: Python support is now available as a sub-package. Once you have installed the packages, you are almost ready to begin testing the new features. Before you begin, make sure that you can login as root without using sudo. Yes, even on Ubuntu. When you are experimenting it is easy to create a configuration, or broken Python code, that prevents sudo from working correctly.</p>

<p>Any data appearing on the terminal of a sudo session can be accessed from Python code. Our first example is a very simple one. Sudo sends data to the Python code in small chunks, sometimes even character by character, as it appears on the terminal. In this case we will list a directory, so data is sent in larger chunks to the Python code.  Thus there is no need to concatenate the incoming data.</p>
<p>Setting up the test environment is easy. Login as root (or use “su”, just make sure that you can become root without sudo). Create a new directory under root’s home, and create an empty file in it:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /root/DoNotEnter
touch /root/DoNotEnter/MySecret
</code></pre><p>Now, open your favorite text editor and create a new Python plugin. It can be anywhere on the file system, but must be readable only by root. For simplicity’s sake I created it under the <code>/root/</code> directory, which is accessible only by root, and gave it the name kick.py as it terminates the session (kicks the user out) if a given text string appears on the terminal.</p>
<pre><code>import sudo

class MyIOPlugin(sudo.Plugin):
    def log_ttyout(self, buf):
        if "MySecret" in buf:
          sudo.log_info("Don't look at my secret!")
          return sudo.RC.REJECT
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the script starts by importing the sudo module. This does not exist as a separate file on your file system, only within the sudo Python plugin itself.</p>
<p>Next, we define a class. You can name it however you like, the only important thing is that it is inherited from the sudo.Plugin class. You will use the name of the class in the <code>sudo.conf</code> file, where you configure sudo plugins.</p>
<p>The IO Plugin has many methods. For this example we are only concerned with <code>log_ttyout()</code>. For a complete list, see the documentation at <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html">https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html</a>. The <code>log_ttyout()</code> method is called by sudo any time when new data appears on the terminal. This data is available in the <code>buf</code> parameter of the method. Any time the method is called, it checks if <code>MySecret</code> appears in <code>buf</code>. If it is there, sudo prints a message on screen and terminates the session by returning <code>sudo.RC.REJECT</code>.</p>
<p>Next, open <code>/etc/sudo.conf</code> in your favorite text editor and add the following line to it:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin python_io python_plugin.so ModulePath=/root/kick.py ClassName=MyIOPlugin
</code></pre><p>Of course, make sure that ModulePath matches your actual setup.</p>
<p>Now, let’s login as a user and start a shell using sudo. Change to the <code>/root/</code> directory and list it. You can see an interesting looking directory name: <code>DoNotEnter</code>. Obviously, you enter it and try to list it to see why it has this name. Boom. Your session is terminated, even before <code>MySecret</code> could appear on the terminal. Here is what you should see:</p>
<pre><code>[czanik@centos7sudo ~]$ sudo -s
Password: 
[root@centos7sudo czanik]# cd /root/
[root@centos7sudo ~]# ls
DoNotEnter        kick.py
[root@centos7sudo ~]# cd DoNotEnter/
[root@centos7sudo DoNotEnter]# ls
Don't look at my secret!
                        Hangup
</code></pre>
<p>Unless you copy and paste large chunks of text to your terminal, checking user input is a bit more complicated. Input arrives character by character, as the user types it, so you need to concatenate it before checking the content.</p>
<p>Note: The following sample code is a very naive implementation, as it only does exact matches. As soon as someone uses backspace to fix a spelling mistake or uses a different order of command line parameters, it cannot detect the command.</p>
<p>Lacking creativity I saved the following code in <code>/root/kick_v2.py</code> (see the previous section for an explanation):</p>
<pre><code>import sudo

class MyIOPlugin(sudo.Plugin):
    def __init__(self, version: str, plugin_options, **kwargs):
        self.collected_buf = ''
        
    def log_ttyin(self, buf):
        self.collected_buf += buf
        if "rm -fr" in self.collected_buf:
          sudo.log_info("\n\nOops. 'rm -fr' is dangerous! Kicking you out...")
          return sudo.RC.REJECT
        # drop all the string until last enter:
        last_enter_pos = self.collected_buf.rfind("\n")
        if last_enter_pos &gt;= 0:
          self.collected_buf = ''
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the script starts by importing the sudo module. This does not exist as a separate file on your file system, only within the sudo Python plugin itself. Next, we define a class. Name it however you like, the only important thing is that it is inherited from the sudo.Plugin class. You will use the name of the class in the <code>sudo.conf</code> file, where you configure sudo plugins.</p>
<p>Here we use the <code>log_ttyin()</code> method of the IO Plugin, but first I initialize a variable in <code>__init__()</code> to collect the keystrokes. When the <code>log_ttyin()</code> method receives data from sudo, it first appends it to <code>collected_buf</code>. Next, it checks, if <code>rm -fr</code> appears in the variable. If it is present, a warning message is displayed and the session is terminated by returning <code>sudo.RC.REJECT</code>. When you hit the Enter key, the content of <code>collected_buf</code> is reset.</p>
<p>Next, open <code>/etc/sudo.conf</code> in your favorite text editor and add the following line to it:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin python_io python_plugin.so ModulePath=/root/kick_v2.py ClassName=MyIOPlugin
</code></pre><p>Now let’s login as a user and start a shell using sudo. Start to enter <code>rm -fr</code> on the command line. You should be kicked out before the final “r” appears on the screen:</p>
<pre><code>[czanik@centos7sudo ~]$ sudo -s
Password: 
[root@centos7sudo czanik]# rm -f

                                Oops. 'rm -fr' is dangerous! Kicking you out...
                                                                               Hangup
[czanik@centos7sudo ~]$ 
</code></pre>
<p>From this blog you can learn the basics of dealing with terminal input and output from Python code. Before going on to write your own Python code, I recommend reading the sudo plugin documentation. Both:</p>
<ul>
<li>C API: <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin.man.html">https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin.man.html</a></li>
<li>Python specific: <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html">https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html</a></li>

In an age where your personal data is being shared with far more companies than you can imagine, the folks at <a href="https://techpolicyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Ftechpolicyinstitute.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F02%2FPrince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf&amp;hash=493602e26ad60bf36acbdc1d6d52c624" rel="nofollow noopener">Tech Policy Institute</a> decided to take a poll. The general public was asked how much money they believe they should be paid by data amalgamators in exchange for their browsing habits, location history, etc. The answers from U.S. respondents ranged from caring almost not at all to just see ads, to demanding $10 for data collectors to see total bank account balances.</p><p>

Across all of the activities covered, Americans would only demand about $3.50/month on average to have each individual piece of personal data shared. A figure far too low when digital advertising revenue eclipsed $100 billion in 2019.</p><p>

As it stands now, the public is being paid $0 for all of the personal information which they choose to share, and for the information which they may not even know is being collected. That information is being used to build data profiles on an individual level which are then repackaged as “targeted advertisements” through ad networks. It’s why you can be searching for something on Google on your desktop and 6 hours later you see multiple ads on Facebook for the same thing for which you were searching on a different machine earlier.</p><p>

VPNs can help cut down on much of the data we unwittingly share, though you’re still going to end up sharing some information if you log into the same accounts across multiple networks or devices.</p><p>

Big Data has, unfortunately, creeped into our lives and is further entrenching itself as time goes on. What’s scary is that Americans, for the most part, do not seem to be concerned about it. Until legislation is passed limiting what can and cannot be collected, there isn’t a lot that can be done about data amalgamation on the macro level. On an individual level, taking care to opt-out of sharing whenever possible, using a VPN and limiting the number of apps on your phone can protect you to some degree.</p></div>

  <p><time datetime="2020-06-09T09:45:00-0400">Tue, Jun 9, 2020</time></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/posts/hp712-nextstep-part-1">last post of this series</a>, I set up NeXTstep on an HP PA-RISC <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/pizzaboxes/hp712">workstation</a>. Today, I’m going to get down to business: configure networking, install system patches, outfit it with developer tools, and install some useful software!</p>
<p>As with the previous post, I’ve also made a YouTube video that covers roughly the same topics! If video is your speed, I’d love for you to check it out!</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4hs4K7AEvQ" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to end up with a capable machine that I can use like it might have been when new, and learn from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="foreshadowing-networking-woes">Foreshadowing networking woes</h2>
<p>While it is possible to transfer files from SCSI drives (or even floppies!), <strong>getting a pizzabox on my home network makes loading software much easier</strong>.
I first tried out NeXTstep on this workstation a couple years ago. The OS installed OK, but I ran in to trouble with networking. I was initially optimistic that I would figure it out:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I'm done for the day but soon if I can fight with NFS and NetInfo (lolololol) I can get screenshots off it and software on</p>— cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/962427825608429568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: she did not soon win the fight with NFS and NetInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second: NeXTstep is a workstation-focused Unix operating system from the 80s-90s - <strong>how could it be difficult to get it on a network</strong>? The answer is a thing called NetInfo.</p>
<p>In a surprise to exactly no one, NeXTstep, being from a company founded by Steve Jobs, had it’s own NeXT-only ecosystem of tools that fit together amazingly well. <strong>The cornerstone of NeXTstep networking was NetInfo</strong>. If you had a collection of NeXT computers on a network, NetInfo gave you a system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage user accounts that would work across all machines</li>
<li>configure file sharing</li>
<li>control permissions around access to network resources</li>
<li>assign IP addresses and hostnames</li>
<li>quickly bring new machines in to the network</li>
<li>serve this information in a highly-available manner</li>
</ul>
<p>which is to say: NetInfo is a “directory services” system. That’s all well and good - in the early 1990s that space had many competitors and a “right path” hadn’t yet been established, but…<strong>I don’t <em>want</em> my machine to be part of a directory</strong>, **I just want it to be on my existing TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-simple-network">Starting a “simple” network</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I (naively) attempted to use the “SimpleNetworkStarter” application.</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/simple-network-starter-1.png" alt="SimpleNetworkStarter">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/simple-network-starter-1.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>SimpleNetworkStarter</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The SimpleNetworkStarter window has three “steps”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>how we’ll integrate</strong> with an existing NetInfo network (since I don’t intend to interact with one at all, I have to choose “Provide the services specified below”, a sort of catch-all)</li>
<li>Specify <strong>my hostname and IP address</strong> - if I were connecting to an existing NetInfo network, I might not have to do this. “Network Options” lets me set more granular IP settings like netmask and gateway; “NetInfo Options” lets me choose how to integrate with existing domains (if relevant).</li>
<li>Setup <strong>network services</strong>: for my setup I don’t really want <em>any</em> of these things, but as a standalone NeXTstep system, I do have to “Maintain the master copy of network administrative data” (aka, the NetInfo database).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, this feels like a really good start, but will it let me fetch files from an NFS share?</p>
<h2 id="networking-woes">Networking woes</h2>
<p>I immediately tried connecting to my NAS over NFS - after all, the main point of setting up networking was making it easier to transfer files. Unfortunately, it didn’t work - I could set up the NFS mount with NFSMananger (more on how to do that later), but the mountpoint would always be empty. Here you can see me attempting to reach it by IP address:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/failing-nfs-mount.png" alt="a failing NFS mount">

      <figcaption>
          <p>a failing NFS mount</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>So I had <em>some</em> sort of problem. To narrow down potential issues, I ran a few tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attempting to ping my NAS</strong> from the workstation - this turned out to not work because NeXTstep doesn’t seem to have any <code>ping</code> command. There are probably ways to accomplish something equivalent with the tools it <em>does</em> have, but I just moved on</li>
<li><strong>attempting to ping the workstation</strong> from elsewhere on my network. This worked - I was able to ping it from my laptop!</li>
<li><strong>attempting to connect to my NAS with FTP</strong> - one of the few network tools NeXTstep <em>does</em> seem to have is FTP, so I gave it a shot. To my surprise, this works!</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)">

      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>It did not work via hostname, though, which points to at least some trouble with DNS. Taking a deeper look at the “NeXTstep 3.3 Network and
System Administration Manual” section on “<a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Docs/NeXTStep/3.3/nsa/11_MixedNet.htmld/index.html">NEXTSTEP Computers in a Mixed Network</a>” (which I probably should have done earlier) shows that <strong>I need to manually configure DNS</strong>. There’s no GUI options for it, you just have to write out an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/resolv-conf.png" alt="editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi">

          <p>editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>After rebooting, I was able to access the NAS via FTP by hostname:


</p><div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-hostname.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>But still couldn’t use NFS. What gives? I have network connectivity in both directions, and DNS is also now working! I believe this is as far as I got a few years ago, and man I was FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought to look in the system log (<code>/usr/adm/messages</code>) for hints:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" alt="an error from autonfsmount">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>an error from autonfsmount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>and there it was:</p>
<pre><code>autonfsmount: Can't get my address
</code></pre><p>Can’t get…<em>my</em> address? Doesn’t the computer know its own address? While I don’t know <em>why</em> it has to do this (googling has provided me a couple of <a href="https://rute.gerdesas.com/node31.html">quick asides</a> mentioning it, but not much detail), <strong>mounting an NFS server requires working <em>reverse</em> DNS for your IP</strong>.</p>
<p>I do have a real-ish DNS server for my home network, and it populates based on DHCP leases and IP reservations. This workstation, though, was just <strong>using an IP that I habitually hardcode for pizzaboxes (192.168.1.200)</strong>. I double-checked the DHCP server config, and it was indeed set up with a different host for that IP, and not set up at all for this hostname. I replaced that entry with one for <code>hp712</code> at <code>192.168.1.200</code> for the MAC address of my workstation, and crossed my fingers.</p>
<p>It worked! I could browse my NAS from the file-browser.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-nfs-mount">Setting up an NFS mount</h2>
<p>After all that rigamarole, the right way to configure a remote NFS mount goes through the NFSManager.app. While NFSManager lets you configure both “exports” (local directories I share with others) and “imports” (remote directories I want to mount locally).</p>

<p>That’s it? A lot of struggle got me to this point, but <em>finally</em> I can transfer files.</p>
<h2 id="patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to <strong>run system updates</strong>. NeXTstep 3.3 was released in mid-1995, and it had three patch updates: the <a href="https://www.nextop.de/NeXTAnswers/2066.html">first</a> at the end of 1995, and the second and <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/nextstep3.3_patch_3_overview.pdf">third</a> in late 1999. Since NeXT were acquired by Apple in 1997, this patch was made by Apple to address Y2k bugs and other longstanding issues. Thanks, Apple! <a href="https://youtu.be/gaI6kBVyu00?t=28"><em>Thapple</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third patch is a cumulative update, so that should be all I need. Nextcomputers.org generously <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/">hosts</a> the patch for download. Because I’m using an HP PA-RISC machine, I need <code>NS33RISCUserPatch3.tar</code>. System updates need to be installed as the <code>root</code> user, and if you run them as <code>me</code> (the default user) NeXTstep doesn’t prompt to escalate privilges, it just gives an error. Thus, I need to log in as <code>root</code> directly. In order to do that, I need to give the <code>me</code> user a password so the system will stop automatically logging in at boot (giving me a chance to log in as <code>root</code>). To set a password, you go to Preferences.app and navigate to the lock icon.</p>

<p>By default, the <code>root</code> password is blank (you can of course fix this after login in the same way as setting a password for the <code>me</code> account). I navigated to where I had put the patch tarball on my NAS, copied it to the HP 712, and unarchived it.</p>

<p>After a reboot, I’m on the most recent version of NeXTstep for PA-RISC, and ready for the year 2000!</p>

<p>What’s next for making a usable system? Developer tools! <strong>NeXTstep came on two sets of discs - “User” for the main operating system, and the optional “Developer” disc</strong> with compilers, GUI building tools, libraries, and documentation. While there were separate versions of NeXTstep User for CISC (m68k and i386) and RISC (PA-RISC and SPARC) platforms, the Developer disc is “quad-fat” - it contains binaries for all four platforms.

<b>Abstract.</b> ACM's 2018 A.M. Turing Award was about
<em>deep learning</em> in artificial neural networks.
ACM lauds the awardees for work based on algorithms
and conceptual foundations first published by other researchers 
whom the awardees failed to cite
(see </a><a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>
and Sec. 
<a href="#I">I</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>,

<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>,
<a href="#XIII">XIII</a>, 
<a href="#XIV">XIV</a>,  
<a href="#XX">XX</a>, 
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>).
ACM explicitly mentions "astonishing" deep learning breakthroughs in 4 fields:
<a href="#A"> (A) speech recognition</a>, 
<a href="#B">(B) natural language processing</a>, 
<a href="#C">(C) robotics</a>, 
<a href="#D">(D) computer vision</a>,
as well as "powerful" new deep learning tools in 3 fields: 
<a href="#VII">(VII) medicine, astronomy, materials science</a>.
Most of these breakthroughs and tools, however, were directly based on 
the results of my own labs in the past 3 decades 
 (e.g., Sec.  
<a href="#A">A</a>,
<a href="#B">B</a>,
<a href="#C">C</a>,
<a href="#D">D</a>,
<a href="#VII">VII</a>,
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,
<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>). 
I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history (e.g., Sec. 
<a href="#II">II</a>,  
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>) 
and also 
mention 8 of our direct priority disputes 
with Bengio &amp; Hinton (Sec.  <a href="#XVII">XVII</a>, <a href="#I">I</a>).

<p>We must stop crediting the wrong people for inventions made by others.
Instead let's heed the recent call in the journal <em>Nature</em>:
<b>"Let 2020 be the year in which we value those who ensure that 
science is self-correcting"</b> <a href="#SV20">[SV20]</a>.
Like those who know me can testify, finding and citing original sources of scientific and technological innovations is important to me, whether they are mine or other people's <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a> <a href="#DL2">[DL2]</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> <a href="#NASC1">[NASC1-9]</a>. The present page is offered as a resource for computer scientists who share this inclination. 
By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations and crediting the original inventors, 
I am not diminishing important contributions made by popularizers of those inventions. 
My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts, to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning,
and to fight plagiarism in all of its more or less subtle forms. 
I am also inviting others to contribute additional relevant 
references (send them to <em>juergen@idsia.ch</em>). 



</p><p> I will focus on 
contributions praised by
ACM's official justification <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> of the

<b>I'll point out 
that  highly cited publications of the awardees ignored fundamental

While Drs. LeCun &amp; Bengio &amp; Hinton (<b>LBH for short</b>)  
have made  useful improvements of algorithms for 
artificial neural networks (<b>NNs</b>) 
and deep learning (e.g., </a><a href="#I">Sec.  I</a>), ACM lauds
them for more visible 
work based on fundamental methods whose inventors they did not cite,
not even in later surveys
(this may actually explain some of  ACM's misattributions). I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history.

<b>Sec. <a href="#II">II</a>:</b> 
In contrast to ACM's claims, 
NNs for pattern recognition etc. were introduced long before the 1980s. 
 <b>Deep learning with multilayer perceptrons started in 1965</b> through Ivakhnenko &amp; Lapa
long before LBH who have never cited them, not even in recent work.
<b>In the 1980s,</b> "modern" gradient-based learning 
worked only for rather shallow NNs,
<b>but it became really deep in 1991 in my lab,</b>
first through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">unsupervised pre-training of NNs</a>, 
then through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">supervised LSTM</a>.
<b>Sec.  <a href="#I">I</a></b> contains 4 subsections 
<b><a href="#A">A</a>, <a href="#B">B</a>, <a href="#C">C</a>, <a href="#D">D</a></b>
on <b>the  4 deep learning "breakthroughs" explicitly 
mentioned by ACM</b>. ACM does not mention that they were 
mostly based on deep learning techniques of my team:

</p><p>
<b>Sec.
<a href="#A">A: Speech Recognition</a></b> (see also <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp; <a href="#XV">XV</a>): The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition 
combines two methods from my lab: <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a> (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006), applied to speech in 2007. 
Hinton (2012) and Bengio (<a href="#XV">XV</a>)
still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s;
Hinton et al. (2012) did not compare it to 
our revolutionary CTC-LSTM (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">which was soon on most smartphones</a>).

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#B">B: Natural Language Processing</a></b> (see also  <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp;  <a href="#XVI">XVI</a>): 
The first superior end-to-end neural machine translation  
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">soon used for several billions of
translations each day by the big platform companies</a>)
was also based on our <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#C">C: Robotics</a></b>.
Our LSTM trained by <b>Reinforcement Learning</b> (RL) was also the core of the 
most visible breakthroughs in robotics and video games.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#D">D: Computer Vision</a></b>
(see also   
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIV">XIV</a>  &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a>  &amp;  <a href="#VI">VI</a>)
was revolutionized by <b>convolutional NNs</b> (CNNs).
The basic CNN architecture is due to Fukushima (1979). 
NNs with convolutions were later (1987) combined by Waibel with backpropagation and weight sharing, 
and applied to speech. <b>All before</b> LeCun's CNN work  (<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>).
We showed twice (1991-95 and 2006-10) that 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">deep NNs 
don't need unsupervised 
pre-training</a> (in contrast to Hinton's claims). Our team (Ciresan et al.)  
made CNNs fast &amp; deep enough for  
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">superior computer vision  in 2011</a>,
<b>winning 4 image recognition contests in a row
before Hinton's team won one</b>. ResNet (ImageNet 2015 winner)
is a special case of our earlier <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html">Highway Nets</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  <a href="#XIV">XIV:</a></b>
Again ACM recognizes work that failed to cite the pioneers.
Long before Hinton (2012), Hanson (1990) had a variant of <b>dropout</b>, 
and v. d. Malsburg (1973) had <b>rectified linear neurons</b>; Hinton did not cite them.
Already in 2011,
our deep &amp; fast CNN  more than <b>"halved the error rate for object recognition"</b> (ACM's wording) 
in a computer vision contest 
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">where LeCun participated</a>), 
long before Hinton's similar CNN (2012). 
<b>Sec. <a href="#XI">XI</a>:</b>  ACM mentions GPU-accelerated NNs  
pioneered by Jung &amp; Oh (2004). LBH
did not cite them.
Our deep GPU-NN of 2010 debunked <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">unsupervised pre-training (introduced by myself in 1991 and later championed by Hinton)</a>, 
and our GPU-CNN of 2011 was the first  
to win contests in <b>computer 
vision</b> (explicitly mentioned by ACM).
 

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a></b>:
ACM credits LeCun for developing CNNs. However, the foundations of CNNs were laid earlier by 
Fukushima and Waibel  (Sec. <a href="#D">D</a>).
 ACM also explicitly mentions <b>autonomous driving</b> and <b>medical image analysis</b>.
The first team to win relevant international contests in these fields 
through deep CNNs was ours (2011, 2012, 2013).
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#VII">VII</a>:</b> ACM explicitly mentions  <b>medicine</b> and
 <b>materials science</b>. Our deep NNs were the 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html">first to win medical imaging competitions</a>
 in 2012 and 2013, and the first to apply deep NNs to material defect detection in industry (since 2010).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#XII">XII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIX">XIX</a> &amp; <a href="#XXI">XXI</a>:</b> Modern

Hinton has never cited him.

on this (since 1965).
<b>Sec. <a href="#XXI">XXI</a>:</b> ACM credits LeCun for work on

And also for work on
<b>deep learning for graphs</b> that failed to cite 
the earlier work  by Sperduti &amp; Goller &amp; Küchler &amp; Pollack.



</p><p>
<b>Sec. 
<a href="#XV">XV</a>:</b> ACM credits Bengio for hybrids of NNs and  probabilistic models of sequences.

was not the first on this topic, and is 
not important for <b>modern deep learning speech recognition systems</b> (mentioned by ACM) based on our CTC-LSTM
 (Sec.

June 26, 2020 | https://www.nickwilcox.com/blog/arm_vs_x86_memory_model/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.nickwilcox.com/blog/arm_vs_x86_memory_model/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>With Apple’s recent announcement that they are moving away from Intel X86 CPU’s to their own ARM CPU’s for future laptops and desktops I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the some differences that can affect systems programmers working in Rust.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where ARM CPU’s differ from X86 is their memory model. This article will take a look at what a memory model is and how it can cause code to be correct on one CPU but cause race conditions on another.</p>

<h2 id="memory-models">Memory Models</h2>

<p>The way loads and stores to memory interact between multiple threads on a specific CPU is called that architecture’s Memory Model.</p>

<p>Depending on the memory model of the CPU, multiple writes by one thread may become visible to another thread in a different order to the one they were issued in.</p>

<p>The same is true of a thread issuing multiple reads. A thread issuing multiple reads may receive “snapshots” of global state that represent points in time ordered differently to the order of issue.</p>

<p>Modern hardware needs this flexibility to be able to maximize the throughput of memory operations. While CPU clock rates and core counts have been increasing with each new CPU iteration, memory bandwidth has struggled to keep up. Moving data from memory to operate on is often the bottle neck in the performance of applications.</p>

<p>If you’ve never written multi-threaded code, or only done so using higher level synchronization primitives such as <code>std::sync::Mutex</code>, you’ve probably never been exposed to the details of the memory model. This is because the CPU, despite whatever reordering it’s memory model allows it to perform, always presents a consistent view of memory to the current thread.</p>

<p>If we look at the below snippet of code that writes to memory and then reads the same memory straight back, we will always get the expected value of <code>58</code> back when we read. There is never the case that we’d read some stale value from memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read_after_write</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>u32_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"the value is {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>I’m using volatile operations because if I used normal pointer operations the compiler is smart enough to skip the memory read and just prints the value <code>58</code>. 
Volatile operations stop the compiler from reordering or skipping our memory operation. However they have no affect on hardware (or the compiler re-ordering relative to non-volatile memory operations).</em></p>

<p>Once we introduce multiple threads, we’re now exposed to the fact that the CPU may be reordering our memory operations.</p>

<p>We can examine the snippet below in a multi-threaded context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>(),</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we initialize the contents of both pointers to <code>0</code>, and then run each function in a different thread, we can list the possible outcomes for the reader. We know that there is no synchronization, but based on our experience with single threaded code we think the possible return values are <code>(0, 0)</code>, <code>(58, 0)</code> or <code>(58, 42)</code>. But the possibility of hardware reordering of memory writes affecting multi-threads means that there is a fourth option <code>(0, 42)</code>.</p>

<p>You might think there are more possibilities due to the lack of synchronization. But all hardware memory models guarantee that aligned loads and store up to the native word size are atomic (u32 or a 32-bit CPU, u64 on a 64-bit CPU). If we changed one of our writes to <code>0xFFFF_FFFF</code>, the read will only ever see the old value or the new value. It will never see a partial value like <code>0xFFFF_0000</code>.</p>

<p>If the details of the CPU’s memory model are hidden away when using regular memory accesses, it seems like we would have no way to control it in multi-threaded programs where it affects program correctness.</p>

<p>Luckily Rust provides as with the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module containing types that gives us the control we need. We use these types to specify exactly the memory ordering requirements our code needs. We trade performance for correctness. We place restrictions on what order the hardware can perform memory operations, taking away any bandwidth optimizations the hardware would want to perform.</p>

<p>When working with the <code>atomic</code> module, we don’t worry about the actual memory models of individual CPU architectures. Instead the operation of the <code>atomic</code> module works on an abstract memory model that’s CPU agnostic. Once we’ve expressed our requirements on the loads and stores using this Rust memory model, the compiler does the job of mapping to the memory model of the target CPU.</p>

<p>The requirements we specify on each operation takes the form of what reordering we want to allow (or deny) on the operation. The orderings form a hierarchy, with each level placing more restrictions the CPU. For example <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> means the CPU is free to perform any reordering it wants. <code>Ordering::Release</code> means that a store can only complete after all proceeding stores have finished.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how atomic memory writes are actually compiled, compared to a regular write.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/uVQM8T">X86 assembly</a> for the above code, we see the first three functions produce identical code. It’s not until the stricter <code>SeqCst</code> ordering that we get a different instruction being produced.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first two orderings use the <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> (<strong>MOV</strong>e) instruction to write the value to memory. Only the strictest ordering produces a different instruction, <strong><code>XCHG</code></strong> (atomic e<strong>XCH</strong>an<strong>G</strong>), to a raw pointer write.</p>

<p>We can compare that to the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/wWQo8P">ARM assembly</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In contrast we can see there is a difference once we hit the release ordering requirement. The raw pointer and relaxed atomic store use <strong><code>STR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>egister) while the release and sequential ordering uses the instruction <strong><code>STLR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore with re<strong>L</strong>ease <strong>R</strong>egister). <em>The <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> instruction in this disassembly is moving the constant <code>58</code> into a register, it’s not a memory operation.</em></p>

<p>We should be able to see the risk here. The mapping between the theoretical Rust memory model and the X86 memory model is more forgiving to programmer error. It’s possible for us to write code that is wrong with respect to the abstract memory model, but still have it produce the correct assembly code and work correctly on some CPU’s.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-multi-threaded-program-using-atomic-operations">Writing a Multi-Threaded Program using Atomic Operations</h2>

<p>The program we’ll be exploring builds upon the concept of storing a pointer value being atomic across threads. One thread is going to perform some work using a mutable object it owns. Once it’s finished that work it’s going to publish that work as an immutable shared reference, using an atomic pointer write to both signal the work is complete and allow reading threads to use the data.</p>

<h2 id="the-x86-only-implementation">The X86 Only Implementation</h2>

<p>If we really want to test how forgiving the X86’s memory model is, we can write multi-threaded code that skips any use of the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module. I want to stress this is not something you should ever actually consider doing. In fact this code has undefined behavior due to not guarding against possible compiler instruction re-ordering (however in Rust 1.44.1 the compiler doesn’t re-order so the code “works”). This is an learning exercise only.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>It is common knowledge that parent-child interactions have a significant effect on the success of any child. But which features of this interaction are most important- quality or quantity?</p><h2><strong>Study Background</strong></h2><p>We find various studies that track the relationship between the frequency of parent-child communication and their academic achievements. Similarly, studies have found positive relationships between the effectiveness and trust in these communications and child’s achievements. Another group of studies has developed the stance that these interactions lead to a strong and healthy self-concept in children and, as a result, lead to higher chances of success at life in children.</p><p>However, there is another hypothesis indicating children’s perceived lack of autonomy that comes with increased frequency of these interactions among parents and children. These research conclude that increase in the quantity of parent-child interaction can lead to adverse impacts on the performance of youngsters. This controversy leads many parents to question the approach they should take to communicating with their children. Should they be more involved or should they appear&nbsp;<em>cool</em>&nbsp;parents?</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01203" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The study under observation</a>&nbsp;claims that it’s not the quantity of this interaction that should remain the primary focus of parents rather they should focus on quality.</p><h2><strong>Research Question</strong></h2><p>This study looked at different aspects of communication among parents and children to determine if the communication quality or quantity affected children’s self-concept more. In the end, it defined the correlation between this self-reported self-concept among subjects and their academic achievement.</p><h2><strong>Method</strong></h2><p>Researchers selected 1815 eighth-graders from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten (ECLS-K). They selected only those middle-schoolers who didn’t change school during the middle school years. They represented different family structures, parents’ educational levels, and ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>They, and their parents, filled out surveys about frequency, scope, environment, and trust of their communications.</p><p>Furthermore, the students reported about their self-concept. The study gathered data about academic performance from the ECLS-K dataset.</p><h2><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>As expected, the quality of communication among parents and children showed a positive correlation with the academic performance of the former. But a novel result of this study appeared when the relationship between the quantity of these communication and academic performance was evaluated. This positive association was a result of a positive impact on children’s self-concept that comes from a higher quality of communication between parents and children.</p><p>The results indicated that an increase in the quantity of these communications could lead to deterioration in the academic achievement of these students. (The researchers explain this finding stating that teens and pre-teens view an increase in communication as a tool to surpass their autonomy.) However, the study found no impact on the frequency and time of communication self-concept of these kids.</p><p>Other findings include a positive relationship between parents’ academic achievements and children’s academic performance and no effect of family structure on students’ performance.</p><h2><strong>Take Away</strong></h2><p>If you are worried about the time you are spending with your kids, this study is for you. It shows that as long as you are using the right communication environment and emotions, the time you spend investigating their interests and lives doesn’t matter.</p><p>The key to parent-triggered success does not lie in repeated and long-lasting conversations. It lies in mutual trust, understanding, and acceptance.</p><p>Reference: Zhang, Y. (2020).

<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>There are 13 address pins (A15-A3) connected between the Dreamcast’s SH-4 CPU
and its SDRAM.  Two, A15 and A14, are used to select the SDRAM bank address.
The row and column addresses are multiplexed on the other 11 pins.</p>

<p>Years ago there was <a href="https://www.assembler-games.com/threads/sega-dreamcast-system-ram-16mb-jtag-hack.41785">a discussion on ASSEMbler
Games</a>
about how to access additional address pins on the SH-4 so that more memory can
be addressed.  Unfortunately, the A16 address pin is not connected, and it also
happens to be on an interior row of a BGA chip, so the only ways to access it
would be by drilling into the PCB from the back or by removing the chip and
reflowing it back on with a wire attached to the A16 ball.  I’m not sure if
anyone has succeeded with that yet.</p>

<p>But reading that thread got me thinking about how memory addresses are
multiplexed on the SH-4 bus, and it turns out that it’s possible to address
more memory by changing how the existing address bus is utilized.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some of the SDRAM address multiplexing options available.</p>

<p>The Dreamcast comes with two 512K x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs for a total of 16MB.</p>

<p>64-bit data (32 bits from each SDRAM) is addressed by 11-bit row addresses and
8-bit column addresses.  The SH-4’s address multiplexing is controlled by the
AMX2-AMX0 pins of the MCR (see Section 13 (Bus State Controller (BSC)) of the
SH7750 Hardware Manual for more details).  The Dreamcast BIOS sets AMX very
early in the boot process, before it copies itself to SDRAM.  An unmodified
Dreamcast uses AMX 4.</p>

<p>Here’s how AMX 4 works (from Appendix F of the SH-7550 manual):</p>

<p>(A12 and A11 on the SDRAM are BA1 and BA0, respectively)</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx13.png" alt="AMX 13"></p>

<h3 id="1m-x-32-bit-x-4-sdrams">1M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs</h3>

<p>The ASSEMbler Games thread considers replacing those with 1M x 32-bit x 4
SDRAMs for a total of 32MB.  These SDRAMs have an additional address pin (A11)
and use 12-bit row address and 8-bit column addresses.  Setting the 12th row
address bit would require connecting the SH-4’s A16 which is not easily
accessible, but here’s how the address multiplexing would look:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx9.png" alt="AMX 9"></p>

<h3 id="2m-x-32-bit-x-4-sdrams">2M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs</h3>

<p>Another approach is to use 2M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs because they have 12-bit row
addresses and <strong>9</strong>-bit column addresses.  The SH-4 can still only drive 11
bits of the row address, so it can only address half of the available 64MB of
RAM, but it can still use the extra column address bit to address 32MB.</p>

<p>One nice property of these SDRAMs is that if you tie the A11 pin to ground,
they behave exactly like the original 512K x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs and can be used
with an original AMX 4 BIOS.  Only 16MB can be addressed in this configuration,
but it provides a way to verify that the SDRAMs are working after you install
them but before you rewire them and switch to an AMX 3 BIOS so that 32MB can be
addressed.</p>

<p>Here’s AMX 3, the address multiplexing mode for 2M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs:</p>

<p>(A13 and A12 on the SDRAM are BA1 and BA0 now)</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11.png" alt="AMX 11"></p>

<p>The Dreamcast is still wired for AMX 4, so the above is not actually how things
are connected.  In reality, the SH-4’s A16 is unconnected, the SH-4’s A15 is
connected to the SDRAM’s A13/BA1, and the SH-4’s A14 is connected to the
SDRAM’s A12/BA0, like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11_actual.png" alt="AMX 11 actual"></p>

<p>That configuration won’t work because the SH-4 will change the bank address
during the CAS cycle by pulling the SH-4’s A14 low.</p>

<p>But it will work if you tie the SDRAM’s A12/BA0 and the SDRAM’s A13/BA1
together (so that both are driven by the SH-4’s A15) and attach the SH-4’s A14
to the SDRAM’s A11:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11_works.png" alt="AMX 11 works"></p>

<p>To achieve this in practice, you just need to scoot a couple of pins over: bend
pin 22 and solder it to pad 23, then bend pin 21 and solder it to pad 22, like
this:</p>

<p>(Pins 22 and 23 are both soldered to pad 23.  Pin 21 is the only pin soldered to
pad 22.)</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11_rewire.png" alt="AMX_11_rewire"></p>

<p>The BIOS needs to be modified to use AMX 3 in order to use the SDRAMs in this
configuration.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>I recommend installing the new SDRAMs in AMX 4 mode so that you can test them
with an original BIOS before rewiring them for AMX 3.  In my case this paid off
because at first, my Dreamcast didn’t boot with the new SDRAMs in AMX 4 mode,
and I had to go back and touch up the soldering to get it to work.</p>

<p>If you are more confident in your rework/soldering skills, steps 4, 5, and 7
are optional if you do step 6 ahead of time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the motherboard and use a hot air station to remove the original
SDRAM chips.</li>
  <li>Bend up pins 21 and 22 on both SDRAMs.</li>
  <li>Solder the new SDRAMs to the motherboard.  For each SDRAM, bend pin 22 down
enough so that you can solder it to pad 22.  Leave pin 21 lifted and
disconnected.</li>
  <li>Solder a wire from pin 86 (VSS) to pin 21 (A11) on each SDRAM.</li>
  <li>Assemble the Dreamcast and power it on with an original BIOS (AMX 4).  If
everything went well, it should boot normally.</li>
  <li>Flash the BIOS with a modified BIOS that sets AMX 3.  You will not be able
to boot this BIOS until the SDRAMs have been rewired in step 8.</li>
  <li>Remove the motherboard again and desolder the wires between pins 86 and 21.</li>
  <li>Lift pin 22 and solder it to pad 23, and lift pin 21 and solder it to pad
22.</li>
  <li>Assemble the Dreamcast again and boot the modified (AMX 3) BIOS.  It should
boot normally.  The AMX 4 BIOS will no longer work.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step-by-step instructions</h3>

<h4 id="1-remove-the-original-sdrams">1. Remove the original SDRAMs</h4>

<p>Disassemble the Dreamcast and remove the motherboard.  Identify the system
SDRAM chips (IC102 and IC103).  Your SDRAMs may have different a different part
number and manufacturer as several different parts were used.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/original_sdram.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard hightlighting IC102 and IC103 with red
boxes"></p>

<p>Use a hot air station to remove the original SDRAMs and clean up the pads with
solder wick and flux cleaner.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/no_sdram.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard showing bare pads where IC102 and IC103 have
been removed"></p>

<h4 id="2-bend-up-pins-21-and-22-on-the-new-sdrams">2. Bend up pins 21 and 22 on the new SDRAMs</h4>

<p>I prefer to lift and straighten the pins at this point before the chips are
soldered down.</p>

<p>You can use the motherboard silkscreen as a guide to identify the pins.  The
silkscreen marks every 5th pad with a white dot.  Line up the SDRAMs with the
IC103 pads:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/lined_up.jpg" alt="Photo through microscope of an SDRAM chip aligned with the 1st solder
pad" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<p>Use the white dots to identify pins 21 and 22:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/pins_to_lift.jpg" alt="Photo through microscope of an SDRAM chip with pins 21 and 22 highlighted and
labeled in red" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<p>Then bend both of them up with tweezers so they are at a 90 degree angle from
the rest of the pins and straighten them with pliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/lifted_pins.jpg" alt="Photo through microscope of an SDRAM chip with pins 21 and 22
lifted" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<h4 id="3-solder-the-sdrams-to-the-motherboard">3. Solder the SDRAMs to the motherboard</h4>

<p>On each SDRAM, leave pin 21 (the left lifted pin) unconnected, but bend pin 22
(the right lifted pin) back down enough so that you can solder it to pad 22.
You will lift it up again in step 8.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/soldered.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard showing two SDRAM chips with pin 21
lifted"></p>

<h4 id="4-solder-a-wire-from-pin-86-vss-to-pin-21-a11-on-both-sdrams">4. Solder a wire from pin 86 (VSS) to pin 21 (A11) on both SDRAMs</h4>

<p>This is temporary, so it doesn’t have to be pretty.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/wired.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard showing two SDRAM chips with pin 21 lifted and
attached by black wires to pin 86"></p>

<h4 id="5-reassemble-the-dreamcast-and-verify-that-it-still-works">5. Reassemble the Dreamcast and verify that it still works</h4>

<p>At this point only 16MB will be available, but this will verify that the SDRAMs
have been installed properly.  You should be able to use the BIOS menu, run a
program from a disc, etc.</p>

<h4 id="6-flash-an-amx-3-dreamcast-bios">6. Flash an AMX 3 Dreamcast BIOS</h4>

<p><em>EDIT: darc has created a <a href="https://dreamcast.wiki/32MB_RAM_expansion">Dreamshell image with 32MB-patched versions of many
BIOS images</a></em></p>

<p>I modified <a href="https://blog.japanese-cake.io/index.php/2016/06/20/release-custom-bootrom-v1-032/">v1.032 of japanese-cakes’ excellent Custom
BootROM</a>
(SHA1 ec42875983f33cefafe8616eb9152cf0172136ae) to use AMX 3.</p>

<p>The two values this BIOS uses to load the MCR are stored at addresses 0x005074
and 0x005078.  To modify the BIOS to use AMX 3 instead of AMX 4, use a hex
editor change these two bytes from 0x24:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>00005070: 1101 1101 240e 0a80 240e 0ac0 9001 94ff  ....$...$.......
                    ^^        ^^                                   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To 0x1c:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>00005070: 1101 1101 1c0e 0a80 1c0e 0ac0 9001 94ff  ....$...$.......
                    ^^        ^^                                   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The end result, an AMX 3 BIOS, should have SHA1 sum
cf64d6509aadde812500db0f7571fd51e0ff85bb.</p>

<p>Use Dreamshell to flash the AMX 3 BIOS.  You won’t be able to boot from the AMX
3 BIOS just yet.</p>

<h4 id="7-remove-the-motherboard-again-and-remove-the-wires-you-added-in-step-4">7. Remove the motherboard again and remove the wires you added in step 4</h4>

<p>Don’t skip over this step just because I don’t have anything more to say about
it.</p>

<h4 id="8-remap-pins-22-and-23-on-each-sdram">8. Remap pins 22 and 23 on each SDRAM</h4>

<p>On each SDRAM, lift pin 22, bend it to the right so that it touches pin 23, and
solder it to pin 23.  Also on each SDRAM, bend pin 21 to the right and solder
it to pad 22.</p>

<p>The result should be that pins 22 and 23 are soldered together, and pin 21
should be the only pin soldered to pad 22.</p>

<p>Here’s the finished IC102:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/ic102.jpg" alt="A closeup photo of the IC102 SDRAM showing pins 22 and 23 soldered to the
pads to their right" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<p>The finished IC103:</p>

<p>And a bird’s eye view of the finished product.  It’s difficult …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This will be a 2 post guide, where we will scrape this website on <code>Page Title</code>, <code>URL</code> and <code>Tags</code>, for blog posts, then we will ingest this data into Elasticsearch. - <a href="">This Post</a></p>
<p>Once we have our data in Elasticsearch, we will build a Search Engine to search for these posts, the frontend will consist of Python Flask, Elasticsearch Library and HTML, which will be coverend in <a href="https://sysadmins.co.za/building-a-search-engine-for-our-scraped-data-on-elasticsearch-part-2/">Part 2</a></p>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong></p>
<p>Always ensure that you are scraping for the right reasons, in this example, I will use my own blog site as the target, and I won't be scraping the websites data, but only Page Title, URL and Tags, so that we have enough data for our search engine.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>For this example I am using Ubuntu 16.04, and we will need some dependencies to install for our Python Script:</p>
<pre><code>$ apt udpate &amp;&amp; apt upgrade -y
$ apt install python python-dev python-setuptools python-lxml openssl libssl-dev python-pip
$ pip install requests
$ pip install bs4
$ pip install elasticsearch
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Python Scraper:</strong></p>
<p>Here is our Python Scraper that will scrape the data from a <code>sitemap.xml</code> and ingest the data into Elasticsearch:</p>
<pre><code>import re
import time
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es_client = Elasticsearch(['http://10.0.1.10:9200'])

drop_index = es_client.indices.create(index='blog-sysadmins', ignore=400)
create_index = es_client.indices.delete(index='blog-sysadmins', ignore=[400, 404])

def urlparser(title, url):
    # scrape title
    p = {}
    post = title
    page = requests.get(post).content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'lxml')
    title_name = soup.title.string

    # scrape tags
    tag_names = []
    desc = soup.findAll(attrs={"property":"article:tag"})
    for x in xrange(len(desc)):
        tag_names.append(desc[x-1]['content'].encode('utf-8'))

    # payload for elasticsearch
    doc = {
        'date': time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        'title': title_name,
        'tags': tag_names,
        'url': url
    }

    # ingest payload into elasticsearch
    res = es_client.index(index="blog-sysadmins", doc_type="docs", body=doc)
    time.sleep(0.5)

sitemap_feed = 'https://sysadmins.co.za/sitemap-posts.xml'
page = requests.get(sitemap_feed)
sitemap_index = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
urls = [element.text for element in sitemap_index.findAll('loc')]

for x in urls:
    urlparser(x, x)
</code></pre>
<p>This scraper will grab all the posts from the <code>sitemap.xml</code> then loop through each post, with the given logic, ingest the data into elasticsearch.</p>
<p><strong>Running the Python Scraper:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ python scraper.py
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Verify Documents in Elasticsearch:</strong></p>
<p>After you have executed the python script, have a look at elasticsearch to confirm if the documents were ingested into Elasticsearch:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl http://10.0.1.10:9200/_cat/indices/scrape-sysadmins?v
health status index            uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size

</code></pre>
<p>As you can see we have ingested 80 documents, having a look at one of our documents:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl http://10.0.1.10:9200/blogs-sysadmins/_search?pretty -d '{"size": 1}'

      }
    ]
  }
}

<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://sysadmins.co.za/building-a-search-engine-for-our-scraped-data-on-elasticsearch-part-2/">next post</a>, I will guide you through the steps on setting up a Search User Interface that will be our search engine to search from blog posts that is stored in Elasticsearch.</p>
