<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Management should not be the only option for engineering advancement, or even the default one. So how can we support our leading engineers to follow the career path that they truly want?</p><div>
<div>
<div> <p>Great managers make great teams, and organisations are rightfully eager to find engineers with manager potential. But management should not be the default career path for engineers. Many of the "leadership" skills that make for good managers (e.g. setting a clear direction, caring about other humans, understanding the business, building consensus, communicating ideas) are also the ones that make&nbsp;<em>stellar</em>&nbsp;senior, staff, and principal engineers. If we require these skills at senior engineering levels, we'll boost our ability to complete difficult projects, make better technical decisions, and bring up the skill level of our whole engineering organisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While career progression for a software engineer often involves management, many companies provide a parallel 'technical track': a job ladder for engineers who want to continue to focus on their technical skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many variants of this career path, but a common one is a&nbsp;<em>senior engineer</em>&nbsp;getting promoted to&nbsp;<em>staff engineer,&nbsp;</em>and then to&nbsp;<em>principal engineer</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as on the management track, seniority on the technical track reflects the&nbsp;<em>impact&nbsp;</em>of the role i.e. how much more successful they made the engineering team or the business as a whole. However unlike the management track, this impact is usually achieved without direct authority. While some folks do straddle the line between engineer and manager, staff and principal engineers typically don't have a team of reports who can be deployed to solve problems. This doesn't mean that they work alone though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The technical track is often called the 'individual contributor' track, but few senior engineers should be true individual contributors. Most should be responsible for clear improvement across their team or organisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This improvement comes from creating compelling&nbsp;<strong>technical strategy</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>executing on projects</strong>&nbsp;that wouldn't have succeeded otherwise, and&nbsp;<strong>influencing other engineers</strong>&nbsp;to do their best work. I believe that these three axes are how we can describe success for senior roles on the technical track.</p>
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>It's easy for software engineers to focus on immediate problems. Our most senior engineers should be able to see beyond those immediate needs and prepare for future needs too. By staff level, an engineer should be planning at least a year ahead: understanding how technical changes now (or staying with the status quo) will affect the team then. This means always having a ton of technical, business and industry context, and using that knowledge to predict risks, opportunities, scaling cliffs, and so on. When the way forward is too ambiguous, they should notice which decisions are being avoided and either chase down consensus or make a compelling case for a particular technical direction.</p>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>Our senior engineers most likely got to their role because they're skilled at executing and completing projects. By staff level, they should be able to lead projects that are too broad, ambiguous or contentious for most engineers to tackle. Engineers leading these projects will use a mix of technical and organisational skills. They need to have enough time and mental bandwidth to dig into the details and make big decisions, enough self-confidence to ask the 'obvious' questions that will shake out misunderstandings, and enough organisational clout to influence the technical direction of multiple teams without stomping on their autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Good influence</h2>
<p>We learn from our own mistakes and successes, but each of us only has a finite number of our own projects to reflect on. We need to learn from each other's mistakes and successes too. Our most senior engineers have&nbsp;<em>seen some things&nbsp;</em>and likely broken some things too, and those experiences shouldn't go to waste. Staff engineers can set explicit standards for their organisations, for example by creating guidelines and best practices, by leaving thoughtful comments on code and documents, and by having a high bar for what gets deployed. But they also set implicit cultural norms through their own output. Managers can bang the drum for quality, but if the most senior engineers don't write tests then you'll never convince the juniors to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These three aspects of a stellar senior engineer (strategy, execution and good influence) all need skills that we often recognise as "management" material. The good strategic ideas, the project solutions and the thorough reviews will carry little weight if they're not communicated clearly or if nobody is convinced to follow them. Without the ability to build consensus across teams, we'll choose solutions that may be optimal inside a single team but don't interoperate well, or that duplicate effort. Without business context, engineers will make flawed technical decisions or will waste their time working on something with little value. Without empathy for other humans, review comments may reduce the confidence of junior engineers instead of boosting their skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course all this work needs technical depth and technical judgement too. We want our strategies to be sound, our project solutions to actually solve the problems, and our review comments to make code and designs better. But technical knowledge is not enough on its own. Impact at this level means being a force multiplier.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Not just for extroverts</h2>
<p>I want to be clear that I'm not saying all staff and principal engineers need to be "people people". Influence doesn't have to be loud or extroverted. Leadership can come from designing "happy path" solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes. It can come from reviewing other engineers' code and designs in a way that improves their confidence and skills, or highlighting design proposals that don't have a genuine business need. I've seen excellent staff engineers who would never describe themselves as leaders but who raise everyone's game as they quietly set the direction for their technical area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's possible for engineers who prefer to work alone to still make the organisation better through their judgement and good influence. There are a lot of ways to have impact. But contrast those folks with senior engineers who make the people around them&nbsp;<em>worse</em>. No matter what their output is, it's hard to imagine how they can have enough impact to compensate for the reduced output and growth of other engineers, the effects on employee retention, and the projects that will fail as a result of their unwillingness to collaborate across teams.&nbsp; We set ourselves up to fail if we promote this kind of engineer to a level where they'll be seen as an exemplar.</p>

<p>If we recognise the need for leadership attributes in our most senior engineers, we should cultivate those skills. That means hiring and promoting for the skills we want, finding engineers opportunities where they can lead, and reducing the emphasis on management as the only career path.</p>
<h2>Don't promote for code output</h2>
<p>No matter what leaders describe as the company culture, the skills that are shown to be valued are the ones that are getting people hired and promoted. We need to require strategy, execution and good influence from our senior engineers. If we promote a staff engineer who churns out code but can't work with other people, that becomes the implicit definition of a staff engineer. On the other hand, if our most senior engineers are modelling leadership skills and making everyone better, we're setting up a virtuous cycle. Mid-level engineers will strive to emulate the same behaviour, and leadership skills will grow throughout the org.</p>
<h2>Every project, every initiative and every crisis is an opportunity</h2>
<p>Every cross-team project or messy ambiguous problem is a training opportunity to bring an engineer up a level. While we will sometimes want to deploy our reliable heavy hitters on a project that can’t afford to fail, we should take every opportunity to invite another engineer to try leading a project that's slightly too big for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they're set up for success through mentoring, coaching and lots of support, we'll build the next generation of heavy hitters. The vast majority of our learning happens on the job, so long as we make sure the learning opportunities are available.</p>
<h2>Management is a lateral move</h2>
<p>Management is a&nbsp;<em>different job</em>&nbsp;from engineering. Though on my earlier diagram of an engineering job ladder it is a clear step up, we shouldn't be treating it as a promotion. It should be considered a lateral move to another role. Thinking of management as the obvious "next step up" treats it as a prize to be won, rather than a skill to be honed. The best managers I know are the ones who want to be great managers, not the ones who merely want to climb a rung on their career ladder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our technical track ladder should be a genuine parallel path to our management ladder, with the same status and recognition, and it should be explicit about the leadership skills and business context needed at each level.&nbsp; Moving back and forth between tracks should be normal and encouraged. Skills built on either side will be valuable on the other.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>We'll always need excellent managers and it's great to encourage engineers to manage if that's what they're drawn to. However, it shouldn't be the default career path.</p>
<p>When we push our engineers with leadership skills into management, we're sifting those abilities out of our engineering pool. We can end up without the skills that we need to make our projects successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experienced engineers on the 'technical track' raise everyone's game by modeling what good engineering looks like. They have the mix of engineering and organisational context that's needed to drive projects that most engineers wouldn't be able to tackle. And they talk to each other, ensuring that our technical decisions make sense even when looked at through a global …</p></div></div></div></div>

However, from the 1950s, a series of traffic management plans have replaced much of the water with roads (although one segment was listed and preserved by the Dutch government).</p><p>Following increasing pressure to reopen the Singel canal, residents voted in a 2002 referendum for a ‘master plan’ for the centre involving digging up the roads on the Weerdsingel and Catharijnesingel and replacing them with water again. Utrecht is also building a covered shopping centre, which boats will be able to sail underneath.</p><p>‘You can see the Singel as part of the kaleidoscope of modern city development,’ added Eerenberg. ‘An old military hospital is now a hotel, a monastery become a teaching hospital and then homes and offices…They all had important functions for the city in their time and their place on the Singel.’</p><p>He said that now the city is developing ‘green’ and ‘blue’ corridors for people and nature to develop, with the aim of increasing wellbeing. The Singel will also be joined to the Leiden Rijn and is expected to improve migration routes for thousands of fish.</p><p>‘There’s not much space in the city, and cars take up a lot of room relative to pedestrians, cyclists and public transport,’ said Eerenberg. ‘But these also contribute to cleaner air for residents and liveability. In Utrecht, we choose water and greenery over a highway for cars.’</p><div onclick="window.location.href='https://www.dutchnews.nl/donate-to-dutchnews-nl/'"><div><h4>Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl</h4><p>The DutchNews.nl team would like to thank all the generous readers who have made a donation in recent weeks.

<hr>
<p>I was recently looking into API Gateways for a project. As I was reading up on AWS’ API Gateway, I realized that there were two options that I could potentially choose: <em>REST APIs</em> or <em>HTTP APIs</em>. The two services had similar names and provided similar features and left me feeling pretty confused about which option was more suitable for my use-case.</p>
<p>One can always count on AWS to create new products that end up confusing people even more. As I started digging deeper to understand the differences, I wondered why Amazon created an entirely new HTTP API service instead of improving the existing REST API service. This way the customers get all the benefits and don’t have to spend time trying to understand the differences and choosing the right service for themselves.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll try and do a comparison between the two services, and hopefully, that will be useful for folks who are trying to decide between the two services.</p>

<h2 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h2>
<p><strong>API Gateway</strong> is a managed service that makes it easier to manage the APIs (creating, publishing, and maintaining secure APIs). API gateway has become one of the pillars of the microservices and serverless architectures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/api-gateway-elements/">This article</a> is a great resource for learning more about API Gateway.</p>
<h2 id="http--rest-apis">HTTP &amp; REST APIs</h2>
<p>The first version of API Gateway was introduced in 2015. The first version of the API Gateway is referred to as REST APIs which is probably the most common usage of the API Gateway.</p>
<p>During re:invent in 2019, Amazon introduced a new flavor of the API Gateway, called HTTP APIs. HTTP APIs were designed from the ground up and thus, are supposed to be faster and cheaper than REST APIs.</p>
<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3>
<p>The tables below show the pricing for both HTTP &amp; REST APIs for the us-east-1 region. As shown below, HTTP APIs are significantly cheaper than REST APIs.</p>
<p><strong>REST</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of requests(per month)</th>
<th>Price(per million)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>First 333 million</td>
<td>$3.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Next 667 million</td>
<td>$2.80</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>HTTP</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of requests(per month)</th>
<th>Price(per million)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>First 300 million</td>
<td>$1.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>300+ million</td>
<td>$0.90</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-better-apis-http-apis-now-generally-available/">In their announcement</a>, AWS claimed that HTTP APIs are up to 60% faster than REST APIs. I spun up a simple service to compare the performance for myself. To mimic a somewhat realistic scenario, my service makes a call to DynamoDB and an external third party API. From my tests, it seems like AWS’ claims about HTTP APIs being faster does hold up.</p>
<p><strong>REST</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/http-vs-rest/rest-api-perf.png" alt="rest-perf" title="Rest API Performance"></p>
<p><strong>HTTP</strong>
<img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/http-vs-rest/http-api-perf.png" alt="http-perf" title="HTTP API Performance"></p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>There is a lot of feature disparity between the two offerings and its helpful to look at these differences to understand which service is more suitable for one’s requirements.</p>
<p>I have tried to summarize some of the critical differences between the two services below (as of Sep 2020). AWS is actively working on getting HTTP APIs to feature parity with REST APIs, so the list below might change in the future.</p>
<h4 id="throttling">Throttling</h4>
<p>Both HTTP and REST APIs support Account-level throttling. By default, API Gateway limits the steady-state request rate to 10,000 requests per second (rps).
REST APIs also support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html">usage plans</a> with API keys which can be helpful if you need to throttle at an individual API key level.</p>
<p>AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) can also be integrated with the REST APIs to provide additional protection from attacks.</p>
<h4 id="caching">Caching</h4>
<p>HTTP APIs don’t support the ability to cache endpoint responses whereas REST APIs provide this functionality.</p>
<h4 id="tracing">Tracing</h4>
<p>AWS X-Ray can be used to trace requests made via REST APIs whereas this functionality isn’t supported for HTTP APIs.</p>
<h4 id="endpoint-type">Endpoint type</h4>
<p>API Gateway supports three different endpoints types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge-optimized</strong>: Ideal for geographically distributed clients</li>
<li><strong>Regional</strong>: Intended for clients in the same AWS region</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: can only be accessed from your AWS VPC</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, HTTP APIs only support the Regional endpoint type.</p>
<h4 id="request-validation">Request validation</h4>
<p>REST APIs currently support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-method-request-validation.html">request validation</a> whereas HTTP APIs don’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html">This page</a> from AWS lists all of the differences between the two services.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As of Sep 2020, the main reason to use HTTP APIs seems to be the cost. However, if your APIs need any of the features not yet supported by the HTTP APIs, using the REST APIs will be your best bet. AWS has already built tools that make migrating APIs from REST to HTTP easy, so it will hopefully be straightforward to migrate your APIs in the future.</p>

                        <p>Earlier this year I summed up the perpetual utilitarian lament:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="All%20you%20can%20do%20is%20as%20much%20as%20you%20can." data-author="@sonyasupposedly" cite="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/against-fatalism/">
                      <p>Despite <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smart-rich-and-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nigh-inestimable progress</a>, the world is pervaded by suffering. An unimaginable amount of suffering. Trying to comprehend it specifically and thoroughly makes me feel sick. It is staggering, the magnitude of pain.</p><p>At times the futility of <em>ever fixing this</em> breaks me. How Sisyphean it is, the prospect of searching interminably for new solutions to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140801022058/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordination problems</a>! I lament that positive-sum possibilities can barely be glimpsed through a tangle of innumerable constraints.</p><p>The fact is... it's true. There is tremendous suffering, beyond my ability to convey and beyond the auspices of the word "fix." Nothing can be said, no conclusion can be reached, that will negate that. It is what it is.</p><p>Reality does not have a human value system. The most you can say about the association between the two is that human value systems are figments within reality, gesturing at its structure. Sometimes the gesture is 🙏, sometimes it's 🖕, and everything in between.</p>

It's not that I'm inordinately empathetic or anything, but I share the typical concern for people's wellbeing. In particular, watching someone close to me Go Through Some Shit is gut-wrenching (again, as it is for most of us). And I know that it won't stop! "Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something." Life is other things too, but it's definitely pain.</p><p>The Problem of Suffering seems like a category error, to borrow / repurpose a framing <a href="https://twitter.com/thesravaka/status/1292953978062475272">from @thesravaka</a>. Suffering <em>is</em>. The Problem of Suffering supposes a fantasy in which it is not, but no clever philosophizing can instantiate that fantasy. We live in the existent world, for which suffering poses no grand problems —&nbsp;that fate belongs to its inhabitants. But whaddaya know, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Backstop#pain-is-the-only-school-teacher">pain is indispensable to survival</a>.</p><p>It's okay to grieve, I think — perhaps even unavoidable, or inadvisable to avoid. I don't know how I'd get through this <em>year</em> without befriending grief, let alone my whole life, and my experiences of both have been pretty good compared to what others have endured.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">one of the hardest parts of growing up has been letting myself feel the pain</p>— 🎀 sonyasupposedly.com 🤖 (@sonyasupposedly) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1302469281372749825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2020</a></blockquote>

The most cherished mirages I cry for repeatedly, since they sneak back into my mind to break my heart again. And again.</p><p>I mourn for my fears, for the awful possibility of dreaded outcomes. I mourn for the people I know who are dying, which is all of them, but some much quicker than others.</p><p>There's a lot to let go of, you know? A lot that I can't keep within my grasp. Nor can I pretend to be okay with this state of affairs. Sure, it's okay to <em>not feel okay</em>, but even if it weren't, would that change anything? I would still be appalled by the cruelty of life. I would still struggle with acceptance, despite the relative and objective ease of my circumstances. Likewise, I would still grieve.</p><p>For unnameable reasons I find it therapeutic to examine the facets of pain closely, specifically, and in depth. I want to know how bad it can be. Not firsthand, of course, and thus not with the visceral punch of having learned from experience. Regardless there is understanding to be gained from others' accounts. Would Elie Wiesel have written <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(book)">Night</a></em> otherwise?

(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish">Albert Fish</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta">torment of poor Junko Furuta</a> are my picks for most awful. We're talking very seriously awful, so click with caution.) These days I scarcely have the stomach for extended revelry in prurient gore, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_120_Days_of_Sodom">de Sade's work</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogg_(novel)">Samuel Delany's <em>Hogg</em></a>. But witness to profound hardship is available in other forms.</p><p>Lacking a deft resolution to this preamble, I'll just segue to the books that have helped me process [some of] my rage and frustration with, well... the Problem of Suffering. It may not be a problem for the universe, but it sure is a problem for me.</p><p>A few obvious titles were omitted, since flogging a <em>dead</em> horse doesn't comport with the spirit of the list — corpses can't feel any blows!

<p>I am not one to cry from reading, but I imagine many a reader would when reading of the despair of life with a young family during a famine and of what they witness. There is much more emotional engagement elsewhere in the story, whether it is the despair of poverty; the frustration of the inequities between rich and poor, men and women, workers and freeloaders; the fear of violence and disappointment in the character's choices.

<p>Wang has known nothing other than the hardworking, precarious, life of a peasant. The life within the House of Hwang is as alien to him as the life of a Westerner. He does not consider how different his life might have been if he had been born into privilege. Nor does he realise, since upward financial and social mobility is his dream, how, if he were to succeed, it would change the way he feels about his wife, the way he would raise his sons or the life he would choose to lead. The thought that his sons might grow up in a completely different environment to himself, with personalities, opportunities, ambitions and wants completely foreign to his own would baffle him.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Being productive all the time is not just difficult, it might actually burn you out, but that being said lack of productivity for an extended period of time is dangerous too because it gives the mind an excuse to start looking at all the negative things happening in the world, especially with the global pandemic going on. </p><p>So how does one stay productive consistently? I find that the only way to be productive is through feedback. To be productive you need to receive a small but noticeable reward for attempting to be productive. If that did not make any sense, let me try and explain it with an example.</p><p><strong>Kickstarting the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I wanted to write a piece of content today because I have not written anything in a long period of time. Once this piece is out there on a few social media platforms, I might see a small but noticeable spike in the traffic to my blog which I can confirm from my good friend google analytics. This little spike in traffic is my tiny reward which will kick start a feedback loop.</p><p>Now there is higher likelihood that I will try and write some more content next week because I still remember the feeling of that reward and I want to feel it again, but the difference now is that I have built a tolerance for this reward and the only way I would feel satisfied is if I receive a higher reward which in this case might translate to a higher spike in google analytics.</p><p><strong>Add incremental steps to the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>To receive a higher reward I am now motivated to write better quality content which reaches a wider group of audience and what gets even better is if people start engaging with me after reading my post and wish to dwell further into the subject. </p><p>If I can keep this up every week while slightly increasing the quantum of work but also the quantum of reward, eventually it becomes a habit that I can no longer ignore.</p><p><strong>Use the feedback loop for everything</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I build software, so for me the feedback loop translates to building a small software module that does one particular task, run a few tests on it to see if it functions like it should and this will kick start the feedback loop. I feel rewarded that I built one tiny part of a large project which works perfectly and is ready to be integrated with the rest of the project.</p><p>Incremental steps can then be added by combining different modules with each other and making them work together. The loop becomes much stronger once there is an actual visual component to look at and interact with because at this point you have basically created something tangible and the reward you get from that lasts much longer than the smaller rewards.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>It is entirely possible that I put out this piece of content today and nobody cares. Maybe I do not see any spike in google analytics at all. But the very fact that I managed to write something today and share it a few people who are at the very least likely to give it a read creates a feeling of accomplishment which serves as a small reward to kick start the feedback loop. </p><p>Sometimes the reward is not as great as expected but as long as it is not zero, the loop is strong enough to get you going.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Here's a C function that calls the <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> library to create a Label Widget.  The Label Widget displays the time of the day (like <code>23:59</code>).  This code was taken from the <a href="https://github.com/bosmoment/PineTime-apps/blob/master/widgets/home_time/screen_time.c">bosmoment /
PineTime-apps</a> port of <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> to the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime">PineTime Smart Watch</a>.</p>

    lv_obj_t *label1 = lv_label_create(scr, NULL);

    lv_label_set_text(label1, "00:00");

<p>Functions whose names start with <code>lv_</code> (like <code>lv_obj_create</code>) are defined in the LVGL library. <code>lv_obj_t</code> is a C Struct exposed by the LVGL library. <code>home_time_widget_t</code> is a custom C Struct defined by the RIOT application.</p>
<p>Let's start by converting this function declaration from C to Rust...</p>
<pre><code>lv_obj_t *screen_time_create(home_time_widget_t *ht) { ...

<p>This function accepts a pointer and returns another pointer. In Rust, functions are defined with the <code>fn</code> keyword...</p>

<p>As we convert code from C to Rust, we'll find ourselves doing a lot of this Name/Type Flipping.</p>
<p>Rust is strict about Mutability of variables (whether a variable's value may be modified). <code>*mut</code> declares that the pointer refers to an object that is Mutable (i.e. may be modified). For objects that may not be modified, we write <code>*const</code> (similar to C).</p>

<p>Now let's convert this variable declaration from C to Rust...</p>
<pre><code>lv_obj_t *scr = lv_obj_create( ... ); 
</code></pre>
<p><code>scr</code> is a pointer to a C Struct <code>lv_obj_t</code>. <code>scr</code> is set to the value returned by the C function LVGL <code>lv_obj_create</code> (which creates a LVGL Screen).</p>
<p>In Rust, variables are declared with the <code>let</code> keyword, followed by the variable name and type...</p>

<div><pre><span>let</span> <span>scr</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>lv_obj_t</span> <span>=</span> <span>lv_obj_create</span>( ... );</pre></div>
<p><em>(Yep we did the Name/Type Flipping again)</em></p>
<p>Here's a really cool thing about Rust... Types are optional in variable declarations!</p>
<p>We may drop the type <code>*mut lv_obj_t</code>, resulting in this perfectly valid Rust declaration...</p>
<pre><code>let scr = lv_obj_create( ... );
</code></pre>
<p><em>What is this type dropping magic? Won't Rust complain about the missing type?</em></p>
<p>If we think about it... <code>lv_obj_create</code> is a C function already declared somewhere. The Rust Compiler already knows that <code>lv_obj_create</code> returns a value of type <code>*mut lv_obj_t</code>.</p>
<p>Thus the Rust Compiler uses <strong>Type Inference</strong> to deduce that <code>scr</code> must have type <code>*mut lv_obj_t</code>!</p>
<p>This saves us a lot of rewriting when we convert C code to Rust.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks when we convert to Rust the two variable declarations from our C function...</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>The parameters are missing from the above code... Let's learn to convert <code>NULL</code> to Rust.</p>

<p><code>NULL</code> is an unfortunate fact of life for C coders. In our C code we pass two <code>NULL</code> pointers to <code>lv_obj_create</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  In C: Call lv_obj_create passing 2 NULL pointers
lv_obj_t *scr = lv_obj_create(NULL, NULL); 
</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>NULL</code>s look the same to C... But not to Rust! Let's look at the function declaration in C...</p>
<pre><code>//  In C: Function declaration for lv_obj_create
lv_obj_t * lv_obj_create(lv_obj_t *parent, const lv_obj_t *copy);
</code></pre>
<p><em>From https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/blob/master/src/lv_core/lv_obj.h</em></p>
<p>See the difference? The first parameter is a non-<code>const</code> pointer (i.e. it's Mutable), whereas the second parameter is a <code>const</code> pointer.</p>
<p>Here's how we pass the two <code>NULL</code> pointers in Rust...</p>

<div><pre>
<span>let</span> <span>scr</span> <span>=</span> <span>lv_obj_create</span>(<span>ptr</span>::<span>null_mut</span>(), <span>ptr</span>::<span>null</span>());</pre></div>
<p><code>null_mut</code> creates a <code>NULL</code> Mutable pointer, <code>null</code> creates a Non-Mutable <code>const NULL</code> pointer.</p>
<p><code>ptr</code> references the Rust Core Library, which we import like this...</p>


<p>When we insert the <code>NULL</code> parameters into the converted Rust code, we get this...</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in an incredible time in human history where the basic infrastructure for many of us is so good.</p><p>In today’s world it is possible to get ahead and achieve a lot all by yourself. You can be a writer with 1mn readers, a social media star with 1mn followers, or a SaaS business with $1mn in ARR.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the mindset Sankalp and I both embodied when we first started on our journey. We had faith that just the 2 of us working together towards our shared goal is enough to get us really far.</p><p>Thankfully that faith turned into reality and lead to the success of SuperLemon.</p><h3>Challenging our beliefs</h3><p>But any great mindset or philosophy is only as great as the people who practice it, and people are always evolving and getting better. Mindset and philosophy evolves too.</p><p>The people in our lives who believed in us and wanted us to do even better challenged us on our beliefs of doing things amongst just the 2 of us.</p><p>One of them said - we are setting small goals, because we are afraid of hiring. If we had the confidence that we can put together a great team, we would think bigger and set higher goals.</p><p>We knew in our hearts that the challenge was genuine. Due to our poor experiences with hiring in the past, we started favouring the path of least resistance, which is to not try to hire anyone. Automatically our goals would only be as lofty as how much the two of us can achieve together. </p><p>We had to change this about ourselves. And so we immediately set out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93/status/1296089975818055680" target="_blank">hire someone amazing</a> into our team. It was an exercise to prove to ourselves that we have what it takes to do this.</p><h3>An updated mindset</h3><p>Less than a month later, we hired an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">first engineer</a> and have made an offer to another. This exercise has turned out way better than we anticipated, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It allowed us to dream bigger.</p><p>Our mindset and philosophy has thus been updated - We can get far in today’s world just by ourselves, but if we want to get really really far with our next venture <a href="https://delight.chat/" target="_blank">Delight.chat</a>, we need more than just the two of us.&nbsp;</p><p>While we suddenly haven't started wanting to build a 400 person company, our mindset has evolved enough to accept and understand how building a team of 5-15 people could produce a 100x result of what we had previously set out to achieve.</p><h3>People on the inside</h3><p>We need people on the inside (a team) who are aligned with our shared vision, and working together using their mind and abilities towards achieving that goal. </p><p>It's not just having more hands in the engineering team in building the product, or marketing team in creating content or distribution channels.</p><p>Their consciousness, ideas, problem solving abilities, attitude and values get added into a collective pool with our own. The sum is greater than the parts.</p><p>The people joining our team are entrepreneurial minds whose values align with ours, who want to build and grow something new and challenging from the ground up, learn from the experience, and eventually start their own companies. We will be their first supporters when they do. Psst, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-our-tribe-at-Delight-chat-dfb896c946a843ebb58bbb1cc161fe33#dfa80f89af17410e9076d1d4fbfcff35" target="_blank">we are hiring</a>.</p><h3>People on the outside</h3><p>We need people on the outside (advisors, investors) who are aligned with our end goal of building a great company, and are going out of their way in helping us get there. </p><p>They align with our mindset of building a real business that thrives without burning $1 for 70 cents,&nbsp;delivers real value to end users, and grows to a reasonably large size while being profitable.</p><p>Their experience observing other entrepreneurs and companies will help us avoid common pitfalls, make better connections like key hires, and open up doors that we can't even imagine today, because we don't know those doors exist. Serendipity.</p><h3>Onwards</h3><p>I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that we have a handful of such people who believe in us, and who are now working with us towards achieving our shared goal.</p><p>Together, we will reach farther than we previously dared to imagine.</p><p>Off we go towards the next milestone in this great adventure.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Everything is being scanned. From avocados to Amsterdam, from your living room to the local park, it has become easier than ever to take 3D ‘snapshots’ of physical things.</p><p>This has profound implications for the next major shift in computing: to one in which spatial awareness, machine learning and new devices combine to radically change, well, everything.</p><p>And yet this shift is nearly invisible to those who don’t work in simulated reality ( <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/09/10/apple-developing-new-3d-spatial-audio-format-for-apple-glass-and-other-ar-uses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s term</a> for XR/AR/VR/AcronymX).</p><p>It can even get a bit confusing inside the industry, with so many terms floating around. But Matt Miesnieks makes an important point:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>What if it uses 6dof camera pose and/or processed in real time? Or uses a neural network?</p><p>It’s all the same thing. 3D reconstruction just diff quality, speed, cost</p></div>— Matt Miesnieks (@mattmiesnieks) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattmiesnieks/status/1299741290221903872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>There are dozens of ways to capture reality. And they’re arriving at different resolutions.</p><h2>LiDAR, Cameras and Scans for Everyone</h2><p>Some people like to see photos of food, fashion or cute animals in their social feeds. Myself? I like looking at the latest scans. Call me geeky, but I find this way more sexy than a photo of the latest loaf of bread someone baked:</p><figure></figure><p>Now, this isn’t that much different, really, than taking a selfie in Snapchat and adding a face filter. Your camera is being used to detect the dimensions of what it sees. Snapchat is simply taking a ‘scan’ of your face, detecting its contours, and the ‘filter’ then attaches effects and elements to this unseen scan.</p><p>But with photogrammetry, you can export this scan.</p><p>This, for example, isn’t “real”: it’s a scan that uses <a href="https://www.capturingreality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RealityCapture</a> software to export and use the asset that was created:</p><figure></figure><p>The above is a walk-through of an entirely digital ‘twin’ based on interpreting a camera “walk-through’ of a physical space:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="589" src="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-1024x589.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-1024x589.jpg 1024w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-768x442.jpg 768w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-1536x884.jpg 1536w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-770x443.jpg 770w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__.jpg 2024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Until recently. the camera on your phone was the most powerful way to scan 3D objects, faces and spaces. “Behind” the camera was a lot of computing power. Being able to interpret video and convert it into a 3D digital object using software was a big lift.</p><p>Over time, the software became more accessible.</p><p>But if you wanted, for example, to scan a whole city, you needed a Google car driving around with a lot of equipment on the roof.</p><h3>Apple Brings LiDAR to the Masses</h3><p>When <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2020/03/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-lidar-scanner-and-trackpad-support-in-ipados/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple added LiDAR to the iPad Pro</a>, it maybe didn’t give you the ability to easily scan a whole city (there’s a limited range to what the LiDAR can see), but it HAS allowed developers to do some pretty detailed scans of nearby rooms and objects.</p><p>Combined with advances to ARKit, the software that developers use to create AR experiences for iOS, you can use the LiDAR to rapidly detect the contours of the world around you:</p><figure></figure><p>This will allow for AR experiences that are richer and more ‘realistic’. But combined with machine learning, it will also power a new generation of apps in other categories.</p><p>I’m expecting, for example, that with the launch of iOS 14, that there will be an explosion of fitness apps which give you a ‘virtual coach’:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="551" src="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large.jpg 980w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large-768x432.jpg 768w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large-770x433.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></figure><h2>Large Scale Scans and Machine Learning</h2><p>So, the ability to scan nearby objects and environments is becoming more and more accessible because of advances in how well your phone’s camera can “see”, as well as the addition of LiDAR to devices like the iPad (and the upcoming iPhone).</p><p>As we shift our view to a larger scale, the kinds of scans that were once reserved to Google Street View cars or owners of highly specialized (and expensive) equipment are now possible at a lower price.</p><p>This has shifted large-scale scanning from being either a niche business or available only to the big players like Apple and Google.</p><p>Once a leader in “professional” LiDAR scans, Velodyne now has competition, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/lidar-is-becoming-a-real-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies in the field raising millions of dollars</a> in funding to support hundreds of customers.</p><p>We can stitch together multiple scans to create high-resolution digital twins of large spaces that contain a lot of objects:</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.pixel8.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixel8</a>, meanwhile, is creating a “common ground truth” which aligns different inputs to create a digital twin of large-scale spaces.</p><p>They took a group of 25 volunteers with phones and were able to combine the data into a large-scale digital twin of Boulder Colorado.</p><p>But where THIS gets interesting is the ability to then take that scan and segment it:</p><figure><div><p><iframe title="Boulder semantic segmentation + co registration demo" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sNLZC2wFt0?feature=oembed&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></figure><p>Because NOW scans aren’t just 3D models. They’re models with semantic awareness.</p><p>Think of it like photos: at one time, a photo was just an object, an image. But now Facebook or Apple knows that the photo is of YOU. That the person standing next to you is Joe, your best friend.</p><p>Apple sends you “memories” with titles like “Your fuzzy friends” and gives you a collection of photos of your dog. Static images can now be interpreted and the objects in them detected.</p><p>This same awareness is now being carried over to 3D scans.</p><p>Even Apple gives you out-of-the-box abilities to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detect the objects</a> seen by your camera. And with ARKit, this is extended to “tag” objects like tables or to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arreferenceobject" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provide your own models </a>(say, a sculpture in a museum) that can <a href="https://medium.com/@Rozengain/using-vision-framework-object-detection-in-arkit-c0b5366f465d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then be detected</a>.</p><p><strong><em>And so not only are we able to scan objects, but we’re increasingly able to ‘understand’ what we’re seeing.</em></strong></p><h2>What Does It All Mean?</h2><p>There’s a pincer movement: city and planetary-scale scanning (which will power everything from self-driving cars to drone deliveries) is becoming a bigger and bigger business,. And smaller-scale scanning is becoming more and more accessible to individual developers.</p><p>Scans are being exported and used in game engines to create hyper-realistic immersion. <a href="https://shodu.net/unreal-5-the-augmented-reality-roadmap/">Unreal 5 gives us a hint</a> of just HOW immersive this will be:</p><figure><div><p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5 Revealed! | Next-Gen Real-Time Demo Running on PlayStation 5" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qC5KtatMcUw?feature=oembed&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></figure><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I was talking with Pixar cofounder Alvy Ray Smith and asked him if I could share this with you about the new <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealEngine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UnrealEngine</a> video. He says "My world is abuzz about this: <a href="https://t.co/A3AR9xWL29">https://t.co/A3AR9xWL29</a> "</p><p>Read on for what else he says about this (the rest of the tweets are his words):</p></div>— Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Scobleizer/status/1264778381775695873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Meanwhile, because of the scans that happen in the “background”, and with advances in rendering and AR creation software, we’re starting to see “blends” of the physical and digital that are looking more and more real. The real-time reflections in this scene hint at how ‘real’ AR is starting to look:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple is not putting this amount of work into incredibly impressive AR visuals.. just so that you can place furniture and play Pokemon. This is their next platform. <a href="https://t.co/ln7hM9h4W2">https://t.co/ln7hM9h4W2</a></p>— Andrew Hart (@AndrewProjDent) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewProjDent/status/1303645899462148096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Meanwhile, delivering all of this to end users becomes another line of attack. I can scan Main Street, for example, but I still need to deliver that scan to a new visitor if I want to give them a fun/realistic and high-resolution experience.</p><p>5G will be critical to the ability to do this rapidly and effectively. It’s why Niantic has formed a Planet-Scale AR Alliance:</p><figure></figure><p>All of these efforts point to a new generation of spatially-aware computing. The lines are blurring:</p><ul><li>Digital objects can be created by scanning physical ones, or the physical world can be supplemented with things that don’t really exist</li><li>The real world has a digital twin – one that is increasing in size and resolution because of how many companies are attempting to “map reality”</li></ul><p>And this only scratches the surface of what it all means. Because these things are also <strong><em>interactive</em></strong>.</p><p>I can control the physical world within a digital twin that is accessed from the other side of the planet. I can click on physical objects and interact with their digital overlays. Objects can shuttle back-and-forth between physical and digital realities.</p><p>All of those scans I see, all of the little experiments being conducted – they ARE the breakthrough in AR that will power the next few years. They are also the foundation piece in preparing for a sea-change in computing, one where new devices (like glasses) and ambient computing will, eventually, make activities like visiting your Facebook page seem quaint.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I'm proud to release my online 2048 AI, <a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/">Jupiter</a>. Jupiter uses a machine learning method called the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.</p>

</ul>
<h2>More About This Project</h2>
<p>Jupiter (formerly known as Jacob) started as a small AI project in January 2018. I got the idea of using Monte Carlo simulations and search trees as a method to play 2048 from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23853848/10007107">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a basic clone of what was described in the answer and built on the idea with an interactive console and my own 2048 game implementation, in contrast to the existing open sourced game code used in other AI projects. At this time, Jupiter ran on the main JavaScript thread, and had decent performance and speed: it was able to run \~800 Monte Carlo simulations of possible games per second. Running the game at 200 simulations per move gave roughly 4 moves per second. This amount of simulations reaches the winning 2048 tile about 65-75% of the time.</p>
<p>In August 2020, I took a look at the project once again and noticed the potential to improve both performance and speed of the AI. I did some more research on Monte Carlo simulations and search trees, notably watching <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-6-monte-carlo-simulation/">a great lecture</a> by MIT Prof. Guttag in MIT's 6.0002 undergraduate course. In the one and a half years since I had first started the project, I'd also learned and used numerous modern JavaScript features, frameworks, and libraries. This put in me the unique position to use these new skills to extend this project vastly from performance, speed, bundle size, and design perspectives.</p>
<p>So, I spent time refactoring existing code and replacing older algorithms with newer and more performant ones. In particular, I took advantage of modern JavaScript features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> to differ tasks to new threads and utilize concurrency capabilities. I also added Webpack to the project for the automated speed and bundle size optimizations built into many of its loaders. With new CSS and design skills I had learned over the past one and half years, I built a new design for the site, with a clearer console and mobile responsiveness. And finally, among many other features, I added "tile milestones" to let users know how fast the AI had reached certain tiles in the game.</p>
<p>With the numerous updates to the project in 2020, Jupiter was now able to run \~2650 simulations of possible games per second. Running the game at 200 simulations per move gave around 13 moves per second. This indicated that <strong>performance had more than tripled</strong> with the new updates. Moreover, a new addition to the code allowed for performance to grow and scale horizontally by adding Web Workers and threads as general computing speed increases over time.</p>
<p>All in all, the two year gap in which I learned invaluable frontend development and programming skills allowed me to improve the AI drastically in many areas while maintaining the original, extremely effective Monte Carlo based algorithm which stayed the same throughout the development process.</p>
<p>I hope you find this project interesting and take the time to check it out!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Did you know that Apple rolled out support for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fullscreen/">Fullscreen API</a>
on iPad Safari last fall? Well, if you didn’t you do so now. 🙂</p>
<p>What this means is that developers can now create fully immersive web applications for the users on the iPad. It removes every distraction on the screen reliably to help the user focus on the task/content at hand—just like a native app would—and yet it allows them to get away if they wanted to by escaping fullscreen mode.</p>
<p>Meaning, more freedom and better accessibility features of the web! Personally, I think that this is a huge win for the web. <em>It is particularly useful for those of us who use an iPad as their “go to” device for surfing at night</em>. 🤘</p>
<p>While there are some issues in the current implementation of the fullscreen api on iPad Safari, that we will get into shortly, this update from Apple has been nothing short of a bonus for our startup. We built fullscreen capability right into Bubblin’s <a href="https://bubblin.io/">Superbooks</a> for the book-lovers on our site.</p>
<p>The following blogpost explains how we implemented it.</p>
<p>Before we start let’s take a look at the current level of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=fullscreen" target="_blank">vendor support</a> for the fullscreen api:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/fullscreen.jpg" width="100%" alt="fullscreen-api-ipad" title="support fullscreen api ipad safari"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As of 1<sup>st</sup> March, 2019 most bugs around escaping fullscreen mode have been resolved by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from Caniuse nearly all major browsers on the desktop and Android devices have had some level of support for the fullscreen API, and now the iOS Safari <del>doesn’t show the latest information</del> too has a decent level of support. <del>This feature was released on iOS 12.0 Safari (Now iPadOS Safari) barely a few days ago and as of November 4th, 2018 March 1st, 2019 Caniuse still doesn’t reflect the changes yet. Hopefully, it will be updated soon!</del> Updated.</p>
<p>Aside from familiar vendor prefixes, and varying method names and a few other minor inconsistencies across implementations, it doesn’t take much to be able to start using the fullscreen api on the iPadOS Safari.</p>
<p>❦</p>
<p>Here’s how I implemented using vanilla javascript:</p>
<p>First, define a named function <code>_toggleFullScreen</code> that lets you <em>toggle</em> between fullscreen and <code>url</code> mode:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>
<span>const</span> <span>_toggleFullScreen</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>_toggleFullScreen</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>fullscreenElement</span> <span>||</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>mozFullScreenElement</span> <span>||</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>webkitFullscreenElement</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cancelFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cancelFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
		<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>mozCancelFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>mozCancelFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
			<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>webkitCancelFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
					<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>webkitCancelFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
				<span>}</span>
			<span>}</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>const</span> <span>_element</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>documentElement</span><span>;</span>
		<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>requestFullscreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>requestFullscreen</span><span>();</span>
		<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>mozRequestFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>mozRequestFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
			<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>webkitRequestFullscreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
					<span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>webkitRequestFullscreen</span><span>(</span><span>Element</span><span>.</span><span>ALLOW_KEYBOARD_INPUT</span><span>);</span>
				<span>}</span>
			<span>}</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This <code>_toggleFullScreen</code> function takes care of all the vendor prefixes and browser quirks across the spectrum. Now we just have to find out which device, browser, and iOS version the user is on to enable the fullscreen functionality for them. We have to determine if the user is (1) <strong>on the iPad</strong> and (2) using the <strong>Safari browser</strong>, and (3) if the browser they are on is <strong>iOS 12 or higher</strong> already. All of that.</p>
<p>Fortunately (or unfortunately) the vendor sniffing technique comes to the rescue:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We tested the code above on quite a few browsers on the iPad, but vendor sniffing, as you might already know, is an inefficient-cumbersome-avoid-as-much-as-you-can solution.</p>
<p>Going forward I expect more browsers on the iPad to support fullscreen api (maybe iPadOS Google Chrome will be next?) or that they will be ruled out using vendor sniffing. Given that support for fullscreen api on tablets will only improve over time, we can easily revisit the sniffer code above until this progressive enhancement melts into broader support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To see the above code working open a <a href="https://bubblin.io/book/bookiza-documentation-by-marvin-danig/1">Superbook on your iPad</a>, turn a few pages and go fullscreen (menu on bottom right under three dots).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are a few sample <code>userAgent</code> strings that I used to identify browsers on the iPad:</p>
<h4 id="ipad-safari">iPad Safari:</h4>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Mozilla</span><span>/</span><span>5.0</span> <span>(</span><span>iPad</span><span>;</span> <span>CPU</span> <span>OS</span> <span>12</span><span>_1</span> <span>like</span> <span>Mac</span> <span>OS</span> <span>X</span><span>)</span> <span>AppleWebKit</span><span>/</span><span>605.1</span><span>.</span><span>15</span> <span>(</span><span>KHTML</span><span>,</span> <span>like</span> <span>Gecko</span><span>)</span> <span>Version</span><span>/</span><span>12.0</span> <span>Mobile</span><span>/</span><span>15</span><span>E148</span> <span>Safari</span><span>/</span><span>604.1</span>

<h4 id="firefox-original">Firefox Original:</h4>

<h4 id="firefox-focus">Firefox Focus:</h4>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Mozilla</span><span>/</span><span>5.0</span> <span>(</span><span>iPad</span><span>;</span> <span>CPU</span> <span>OS</span> <span>12</span><span>_1</span> <span>like</span> <span>Mac</span> <span>OS</span> <span>X</span><span>)</span> <span>AppleWebKit</span><span>/</span><span>605.1</span><span>.</span><span>15</span> <span>(</span><span>KHTML</span><span>,</span> <span>like</span> <span>Gecko</span><span>)</span> <span>FocusiOS</span><span>/</span><span>7.0</span><span>.</span><span>3</span> <span>Mobile</span><span>/</span><span>16</span><span>B92</span> <span>Safari</span><span>/</span><span>605.1</span><span>.</span><span>15</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>…and so on.</p>
<p>On the CSS side you may not have to make any changes, but there are few options to consider depending on your situation:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>

	<span>/* Custom styles */</span>
<span>}</span>


</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>You now have a web-app that can easily go fullscreen on the iPad Safari and people can enjoy it like a standalone/native app without needing to add to the homescreen. Again, I think this is a huge win for the web and you might want to take advantage of it for your app.</p>

September 12, 2020 | https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/09/12/using-the-monte-carlo-tree-search-algorithm-in-an-ai-to-beat-2048-and-other-games/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/09/12/using-the-monte-carlo-tree-search-algorithm-in-an-ai-to-beat-2048-and-other-games/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently worked on an open source <a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/">project called Jupiter</a>, an online AI to beat the popular online game <a href="http://play2048.co/">2048</a>.</p>
<p>Go try out the AI:</p>
<p><a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtrp/jupiter/master/demo-image.png" alt="Jupiter Screenshot"></a></p>
<p>In writing this AI, I decided to use a machine learning method called the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Monte Carlo algorithms like the one used in Jupiter have been used in several notable AIs, including DeepMind's <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a>, which famously beat the Go world champion in May 2017.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why the Monte Carlo method works</li>
<li>When and where Monte Carlo algorithms can be useful </li>
<li>How I used the Monte Carlo method in an AI to beat 2048</li>
<li>How to implement Monte Carlo algorithms in JavaScript and other languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I got the idea of using a Monte Carlo method to beat 2048 from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23853848/10007107">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<h2>What is the Monte Carlo Method?</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is the idea of using a large number of random simulations of an experiment to gain insights into the experiment's end results. Random simulations of an experiment are frequently referred to as <em>Monte Carlo simulations</em>.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that you were flipping a coin, and trying to figure out the probability of the coin landing heads. With the Monte Carlo method, we could simulate 10,000 coin tosses, and calculate the percentage of coins that landed heads.</p>
<p>Here's what that would look like.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/using-the-monte-carlo-tree-search-algorithm-in-an-ai-to-beat-2048-and-other-games/coinflip.png" alt="Flip Coin Example Graph"></p>
<p>As can be seen, the result converges to the expected value, 50%. A notable feature of Monte Carlo simulations is that a higher number of simulations is correlated with higher accuracy. For example, if we only performed two simulations, there is a high (25%) probability of heads landing in both simulations, giving a result of 100%. This is very inaccurate in comparison to the expected result of 50%.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations <strong>work because of the Law of Large Numbers</strong>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you simulate the same experiment many times, the average of the results should converge to the expected value of the simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Monte Carlo simulations are a way to estimate what will happen in a given experiment <strong>without having to implement any specific algorithms or heuristics</strong>.</p>
<h2>When and Where the Monte Carlo Method Can Be Useful</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is used in a variety of fields, including game AI development, finance and economics, and evolutionary biology to name a few.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo method can be useful in any experiment with a random factor, where end results cannot be predicted algorithmically. For example, in 2048, a new tile at a random location is added after every move, making it impossible to calculate the exact location of upcoming tiles and subsequently the end result of the game as well.</p>
<p>In these types of experiments, running a large number of Monte Carlo simulations can help get a sense of the average end results, the probability of various events occurring, and the relationship between the variables in the experiment.</p>
<p>For example, using the Monte Carlo method to in Jupiter allowed me to better understand how variables like starting move, number of moves in a game, and best tile in the board affected the end results of the game.</p>
<h2>How I Used the Monte Carlo Method in Jupiter, an AI to Beat 2048</h2>
<p>Let's start with a few definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board and Tiles</strong>: a 4x4 grid with tiles optionally placed on each grid spot</li>
<li><strong>Game State</strong>: a set of tiles on the board which represents the board at a specific time</li>
<li><strong>Game Score</strong>: the sum of all the tiles on the board</li>
<li><strong>Real Game</strong>: the game that is being played and shown on the browser, not a simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>At any given game state, let's assume that four possible moves can be made: left, right, up, or down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are indeed cases where a certain move is not possible in a given game state. Removing impossible moves can be easily added to the algorithm later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Monte Carlo method, we can run a set of game simulations for every move.</p>
<p>For each possible move, the program simulates a set of simulations which <strong>start by playing the move for that set first</strong>. After that, the rest of the game can be played completely randomly until it is over.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, this algorithm looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>// assume Game object exists
// assume currentGame variable exists as the real game

const totalSimulations = 200; // 50 simulations are played for each move 

const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];
possibleMoves.forEach((move) =&gt; { // simulations for all four possible starting moves
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; totalSimulations / 4; i++) {
    const simulation = new Game(); // create simulation
    simulation.board = currentGame.board; // copy current game state to simulation
    simulation.makeMove(move); // make initial move
    while(!simulation.gameover()) {
      simulation.makeMove(possibleMoves[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
    } // make random moves until simulation game is over
  }
});</code></pre>
<p>After all the simulations are completed, the program can gather the total final game scores of all the simulations, and average them for each move. We can then find the optimal move by optimizing for the highest final game score.</p>
<p>For example, if the simulations which started by playing left had an average final score of 250, whereas the ones which started by playing the other moves had an average final game score of 225, then left is the optimal move.</p>
<p>In this program, <strong>the optimal move is the one with simulations with the highest average final game score</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note: I could have chosen to optimize for a different value such as the number of moves in the game.</strong></p>
<p>However, this would actually make no difference in how the algorithm functions, because the number of moves in the game almost exactly predicts the game score. In 2048, the new tile added after each game move is normally a 2 tile, but has a 10% chance of being a 4 tile instead. This means the expected value of the new tile is 2.2 (<code>2 × 90% + 4 × 10%</code>). The total value of tiles is also preserved after every tile combination (ex: 2 tile combined with another 2 tile gives a 4 tile). As a result, game score can be calculated by multiplying the expected value of the new tile by the number of moves in the game, or with this formula: <code>2.2 × (real game move count + average move count)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add this functionality of optimizing for highest score to our current code: add an array of total final scores for the simulations for each possible move, and choose the move with the highest value in that array to play like so:</p>
<pre><code>const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];

<p>In the end, this algorithm is simple to implement given a well-written 2048 game class. In JavaScript, there are a number of performance upgrades that can be made, starting by adding concurrency with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a> and pruning moves with very low final game scores.</p>

In fact, it’s the same kind of power source that runs <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-powered-spacecraft-nasa-history-2017-3" target="_blank">many of our space probes and rovers</a>: nuclear batteries.</p><figure id="w-node-14a21ee8947b-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb77fb527a262153ed9df7_NASA_JPL.jpeg" alt=" NASA/JPL"></p><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/MarsCuriosity" target="_blank"><em>“Can’t stop. Won’t stop. </em>A rover’s gonna rove, rove, rove, rove, rove…<em>”</em></a><em> Curiosity, happily taking selfies on Mars since 2012. The white, finned “tail” is its nuclear battery. (Image: NASA/JPL).</em></figcaption></figure><p>It might be surprising, but for the long-term operation of onboard systems, there are currently only two viable power sources: solar power and nuclear power.</p><p>And when conditions get really harsh, nuclear power is the only option left.</p><p>Not quite. Nuclear reactors start a controlled chain reaction by bombarding uranium atoms with neutrons. When a uranium atom is hit by a neutron, it splits and releases heat and other neutrons. These neutrons split further uranium atoms, releasing more heat and neutrons, and so on. This process is called <em>fission, </em>and the heat released is used to generate electricity.</p><p>But even when left alone, the atoms that make up uranium or other radioactive materials will split. This is a natural process known as radioactive decay. It occurs much slower than under neutron bombardment, but it still releases enough heat to create a small amount of power — the power of a nuclear battery, and enough to run space vehicles for a long time.</p><p>Imagine you’re out camping. A nuclear reactor is like the campfire: it kicks out some serious heat, enough to keep you warm, dry your clothes, boil a big pot of water and roast food. You can keep it going as long as you like by feeding it more fuel. A nuclear battery, on the other hand, is like the hot embers that get you through the night: enough heat for toasting some marshmallows, but nothing too energy-hungry. And when the embers burn out, that’s it.</p><figure id="w-node-8821d41fb793-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb79d7ea76f35902dff91d_hot%20embers%20of%20a%20nuclear%20reactor.jpeg" alt="hot embers of a nuclear reactor"></p><figcaption>The best materials for making a nuclear battery are created inside<em> </em>a nuclear reactor, so a nuclear battery really is like the hot embers of a nuclear reactor. (Image: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@revolt" target="_blank">REVOLT</a> on Unsplash)</figcaption></figure><p>The technical name of a nuclear battery is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank"><em>radioisotope thermoelectric generator</em></a>, or RTG for short. Its core is an assembly of pellets containing some <em>radioisotope</em>, usually plutonium-238. (In case you're wondering: This is not the kind of plutonium used in nuclear bombs.) As the plutonium atoms naturally split they give off heat. This heat is converted into electricity using thermocouples, which are wrapped around the plutonium assembly.</p><figure id="w-node-8e34cd69d443-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb7a3e788b5f1c140d35b4_NASA%20technicians%20making%20sure%20that%20Curiosity%E2%80%99s%20RTG%20fits%20as%20expected.jpeg" alt="NASA technicians making sure that Curiosity’s RTG fits as expected. "></p><figcaption>NASA technicians making sure that Curiosity’s RTG fits as expected. (Image: NASA, Wikimedia Commons)</figcaption></figure><p>RTGs evolved over time, as missions needed more power and regulations demanded stronger safety features. The plutonium assemblies got bigger and more modular, materials for thermocouples more efficient, and the plutonium pellets were encased in multiple layers of protective materials to shield against radiation and prevent release of materials in case of damage. The underlying principle, however, remained unchanged.</p><h2>The good</h2><p>There are three main requirements a power source needs to satisfy in deep space, and nuclear batteries are the only one to ace all three.</p><h2>Independence from sunlight</h2><p>While solar energy is the undisputed first choice in Earth orbit (the only exception being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-A" target="_blank">Soviet military satellites</a>), there are lot of places in the solar system where sunlight is simply not strong enough. Jupiter is <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4818" target="_blank">the farthest we have traveled using solar arrays</a>. By the time you reach Saturn, sunlight is only 1% as strong as it is on Earth. Even close to home, conditions are not always favorable: Lunar nights, for example, last about two weeks.</p><p>Things would look brighter on Mars, you might think. Mars gets about one third the sunlight that Earth gets, but winter days are short and gloomy. On particularly bad days, the solar-powered rovers <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Spirit </em>and <em>Opportunity</em></a> had reduced power levels that granted them only a few minutes of operation.</p><p>Mars also has dust storms that coat solar panels with layers of dirt. Both rovers had record-breaking lives on Mars, but eventually fell prey to the Martian sand. <em>Spirit </em>had to be given up after it got stuck and was unable to collect enough sunlight to charge. <em>Opportunity </em>went silent after a violent planetary dust storm. From there on, NASA rovers would be powered by nuclear batteries, not solar panels.</p><p>ESA learned the same lesson <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/2015/06/15/first-probe-to-land-on-a-comet-is-awake-but-our-nuclear-fears-cost-us-seven-months-of-data/#4a185cad32aa" target="_blank">an even harder way</a> when its probe Philae made a few mistakes during its historic landing on a comet, ending up in a shady spot where it was unable to collect enough sunlight. It lasted 60 hours, then the onboard batteries were depleted. It took seven more months before Philae had gathered enough energy to briefly communicate again.</p><figure id="w-node-5609ca543393-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb7afe527a264a97edd729_comet%2067P_Churyumov-Gerasimenko.jpeg" alt="The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko"></p><figcaption>The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, on which Philae landed. With RTGs onboard, light or shade would not have mattered. (Image: ESA)</figcaption></figure><p>Nuclear batteries aren’t troubled by insufficient sunlight. Nor are they phased by the low temperatures of deep space or distant planets. (And it can get <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130920-how-cold-is-space-really" target="_blank">very cold</a> in space.) In fact, the heat produced by radioactive decay is not only used to generate electricity but also to heat the electronics of a spacecraft or rover, thus preventing them from freezing.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0CvzBu5sTps" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>‍</p><h2>Reliability</h2><p>When a spacecraft leaves Earth, it also leaves behind any option of maintenance and repair. This means that all its components must function reliably for years without a human hand touching them. Because nuclear batteries are basically a block of plutonium wrapped in some material, there are no moving parts that can wear and there is really not much to maintain.</p><p>Nuclear batteries are used in some places on Earth for the very same reason: to provide power in remote areas where both sunlight and human presence is sparse.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Energy density</strong></h2><p>Energy density is a measure of how much energy you can get for a given mass of fuel. This matters especially for space exploration, because it costs <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/astp.html" target="_blank">a lot</a> to launch something into Earth orbit and beyond. When every gram counts, you want to get as much power as possible out of the fuel you take.</p><p>Nuclear is by far the most dense power source we have. It beats chemical reactions, such as burning gasoline or coal, by an order of millions.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb7f139eacb1716858447b_energy%20density.png" alt="full energy density in megajoules/kg"></p><figcaption>(Image: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1162/" target="_blank">xkcd.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Curiosity</em>’s 3 kg (6.6 lbs) of plutonium has delivered energy for close to eight years now, and is designed to last for at least six more. The plutonium also provides the heat that keeps <em>Curiosity </em>warm, meaning no extra electrical power is needed for heating.</p><h2>The bad</h2><p>Nuclear batteries contain radioactive material and therefore come with the risk of contamination in case of leaks, launch accidents, or uncontrolled re-entries. They thus sparked discussions about nuclear technology in space, which were <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/090897sci-nasa-saturn.html" target="_blank">further fueled</a> when Cassini planned to leave Earth with a whopping 33 kg (72 lbs) of plutonium aboard. As a result, safety regulations got stronger, as did testing. “They wanted proof of the worst that could happen, so we did our best to smash them, blown them up, shoot them and break them”, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nuclear-battery-tests/" target="_blank">said NASA test engineer Mary Ann Reimus</a>.</p><p>Cassini launched despite its critics. Space-bound RTGs have an impressive safety record. For example, after the US satellite Nimbus-B had to be destroyed during launch in 1968, its plutonium pellets were recovered intact from the bottom of the sea off the coast of California to be re-used on a later mission.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>Nuclear power is an integral part of plans for future space missions, especially for outposts on the Moon and Mars. It remains unbeaten when it comes to energy density and reliability in dark, cold, and harsh conditions.</p><p>As power needs rise, we leave the realm of nuclear batteries. Previous missions used a couple of hundreds of watts, but a future mission to Mars is <a href="https://www.space.com/39433-kilopower-reactor-for-deep-space-missions.html" target="_blank">estimated</a> to need orders of magnitude more. That — as well as <a href="https://www.space.com/5054-plutonium-shortage-thwart-future-nasa-missions-outer-planets.html" target="_blank">a shortage of plutonium</a> — is why <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-nuclear-reactor-kilopower-how-it-works-2018-5?r=DE&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">plans for future outposts will likely rely on fission reactors</a>. And <a href="https://beyondnerva.com/" target="_blank">innovation</a> doesn't stop there.</p><p>The story of nuclear power in space exploration thus seems to be only beginning. From its humble origins powering space probes and rovers, nuclear power is set to underpin mankind’s reach for other planets… and beyond.</p><figure id="w-node-ea287c409d0d-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb8031b4d08e8d77faacf9_Spirit%E2%80%99s%20photo%20of%20a%20Martian%20sunset..jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.erikwernquist.com/wanderers" target="_blank">Wanderers by Erik Wernquist</a>, based on Spirit’s <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140302.html" target="_blank">photo</a> of a Martian sunset.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍<br></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic terms of probability theory
<ul>
<li>probability, probability density, distribution</li>
<li>sum, product rule, and Bayes' rule</li>
<li>expectation, mean, variance, median</li>
<li>in Finnish, see e.g. <a href="http://math.aalto.fi/~lleskela/LectureNotes003.html">Stokastiikka ja tilastollinen ajattelu</a></li>
<li>in English, see e.g. Wikipedia and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/">Introduction to probability and statistics</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some algebra and calculus</li>
<li>Basic visualisation techniques (R or Python)
<ul>
<li>histogram, density plot, scatter plot</li>
<li>see e.g. <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/demos.html#BDA_R_demos">BDA R demos</a></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This course has been designed so that there is strong emphasis in computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest computational tools.</p>
<p>If you find BDA3 too difficult to start with, I recommend</p>
<ul>
<li>For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and causal analysis see <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/">Gelman, Hill and Vehtari, "Regression and Other Stories"</a>.</li>
<li>Richard McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking, 2nd ed</a> book is easier than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking doesn't go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming as BDA course. Richard's lecture videos of <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019">Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan</a> are highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.</li>
<li>For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4 and 5 in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/">Kruschke, "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis"</a> useful.</li>

						Informal workers and street vendors in Latin America have been among those most heavily affected by the pandemic					</span>
							</p><div>
			<div>
				<div>
				
<p>For decades, the region had success in lifting people out of poverty, as impoverished rates had fallen to about 30 percent recently. Unfortunately, that progress is sure to be reversed as the COVID-19 pandemic is set to bring a historic recession to Latin America and widen the wealth inequality gap even further.</p>



<p>The mobilization of poorer people to the middle class is a road that may no longer exist for many in Latin America, as regional leaders and organizations still need to coordinate on needed stimulus efforts that could help keep people afloat.</p>



<p>In all, Latin America is at risk of losing up to 45 million jobs because of the pandemic, analyst Diego García Saucedo <a href="https://www.eldinero.com.do/118081/america-latina-perdera-mas-de-45-millones-de-empleos-por-covid-experto-mexicano/">told the Spanish news wire EFE</a> last week. </p>



<p>The all-important tourism and service industries have been particularly hard hit as international and domestic travel has slowed to a crawl. In addition, the propensity of informal work like that of street vendors seen throughout the region has also been negatively affected while people stay in their homes and adhere to lockdowns.</p>



<p>As the current COVID-19 epicenter, here’s a look at how jobs are faring in some of Latin America’s most prominent countries. </p>



<h4><strong>Brazil</strong></h4>



<p>Brazil’s inadequate response to the coronavirus has made it the second biggest hotspot of coronavirus cases in the world behind only the United States. With more than 3.7 million cases and 117,000 deaths, the damage left by COVID-19 has been immense. </p>



<p>The jobless rate in Brazil is now at 13.3 percent, per the latest numbers from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. This represents the worst rate of unemployment the country has seen in three years, and unfortunately, things keeping trending in the wrong direction.</p>



<p>As President Jair Bolsonaro continues to make the pandemic political – he previously tried to outlaw mask-wearing in public places like schools and churches – and the government fails to flatten the curve, the country’s workers will be the ones suffering.  </p>



<h4><strong>Chile</strong></h4>



<p>The unemployment rate in Chile has skyrocketed to 12.2 percent, according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE). That is the highest jobless rate in a decade and way up from the 8.3 percent from this time last year. </p>



<p>No one has been as heavily impacted as those working in the food industry, although there have also been massive job losses in construction and the commercial sector. President Sebastián Piñera announced a two-year economic recovery package in July worth $12 billion that is aimed at helping Chile’s most vulnerable with direct payments and emergency benefits.</p>



<p>Last year, Chileans spilled out into the streets to protest the growing inequality in the country, demanding change to the system of privatized pensions. There could be growing unrest if the economy does not recover quickly and jobs continue to be lost.</p>



<p>As with the rest of the region, Chile is expected to go into recession this year and suffer a contraction of up to 7.5 percent.</p>



<h4><strong>Colombia</strong></h4>



<p>In Colombia nearly one in five people are without jobs. Despite early planning and progressive local policies designed to keep people safe during the pandemic, Colombia’s workers have been among the hardest hit in the region. But, in a country that already had the highest unemployment rate in the region, the coronavirus has served to highlight existing problems in Colombia’s economy.</p>



<p>The 19.8 percent unemployment rate is a gradual improvement from May’s 21.4 percent rate, but both are a far-cry from August of last year when 10.8 percent of the country’s workforce was without jobs.</p>



<p>As with many other countries in the region, informal labor is crucial to the economy. The majority of Colombia’s population depends on informal work to get by, and this work is even more vulnerable to lockdowns and stay-at-home restrictions.</p>



<h4><strong>Ecuador</strong></h4>



<p>One million Ecuadorians are unemployed, which is more than triple the amount of those without jobs in December. Another 5 million are reported to be in “precarious” or unstable jobs, according to Ecuador’s National Statistics and Census Institute. Of those who still do have jobs, <a href="https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2020/08/12/nota/7938592/jornada-laboral-ecuador-trabajo-empleo-desempleo-sobornos-seguros">a recent study</a> found that 9,000 Ecuadorians have seen their hours and wages cut by half.</p>



<p>Ecuador was noted as being one of the first countries to be dramatically impacted by COVID-19 when an outbreak struck the city of Guayaquil in March. Since then they have been able to flatten the curve and minimize the spread.</p>



<p>However, the economy remains in rough shape and the country is looking to move on from its deeply unpopular president, Lenín Moreno, who has said he will not seek re-election in next February’s vote.</p>



<h4><strong>Mexico</strong></h4>



<p>Mexico’s June unemployment rate was registered at 5.5 percent and the country is seeing large amounts of people enter into the informal labor economy without contracts or benefits. Now more than half (53 percent) of the country’s people are working informally. </p>



<p>Because the country is in a deep debt, it has been unable to offer protections that others in the region have like direct payments.</p>



<p>Mexico was already entering into a recession before the pandemic hit. But now, the Mexican economy is expected to contract by 13 percent.</p>



<p>One surprising development during this ordeal has been the fact that remittances sent from family members working in the U.S. back to Mexico have actually risen. Although that number could go down if cases in the U.S. remain high and the economy falters.</p>



<h4><strong>Peru</strong></h4>



<p>Behind only Brazil, Peru has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Latin America. And with that, jobs have unsurprisingly plummeted. </p>



<p>Peru’s unemployment rate for August came in at 16.4 percent, the highest rate of joblessness so far for the Andean nation during the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time last year, just 6 percent of Peruvians were unemployed. Currently, more than 570,000 people are looking for work. </p>



<p>Construction, food service, and transportation are among the most negatively affected industries in the country. Also impacted has been the mining sector, which is crucial to Peru’s economy.</p>



<p>That’s a large part why Peru is set to undergo a contraction of 12 percent and plunge into its worse economic standing in 30 years.  </p>

                <center><em><p>The most ambitious crossover event in automatic differentiation history</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Friday, September 11, 2020 · 4 min read</h4>
<blockquote>
<p> Summary of this post: It turns out that by carefully mixing forward-mode and
 reverse-mode automatic differentiation, you can greatly simplify certain
 hyperparameter optimization algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a fun recursive idea: just like how we optimize the parameters of
machine learning models by gradient descent, we can also their
<em>hyperparameters</em> by gradient descent. This is by no means a new idea; you can
find 20-year-old papers that discuss (for example) optimizing gradient descent
step sizes by gradient descent itself.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two ways to do this. The “short-term” way is to take a
<em>single</em>  step of gradient descent, and then based on how that goes, adjust the
hyperparameters. That’s the premise of the 2018 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04782">Online Learning Rate
Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent</a>: it
turns out that you can do this in an extremely lightweight way. You would hope
that over time the hyperparameters converge to something optimal alongside the
parameters (and indeed that is the case, though you have to be careful).</p>
<p>The “long-term” way is to train <em>several</em> steps and <em>then</em> backpropagate
through the <em>entire training</em> to adjust the hyperparameters. The hope is that
this provides a stronger “signal” to the hyperparameter-gradient, which is
better for convergence. But, this comes at the (tremendous) expense of having
to store a copy of the entire computation graph for several steps of training,
and then backpropagate through it. If your model has 1GB of parameters, you
need to store ~1GB worth of numbers for <em>each step</em>. You can imagine that adds
up over the course of many epochs, and so the algorithm is severely limited by
how much RAM you have.</p>
<p>The 2015 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03492">Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization through Reversible
Learning</a> makes this work by throwing away
the intermediate steps of the computation graph and then JIT-re-computing it
“in reverse” during backpropagation. It’s a clever technique, but kind of hairy
and hard to implement (you have to be super careful about numerical precision).</p>
<p>Here’s a graph that visualizes these two techniques (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13371">from this
paper</a>). You’re looking at several parallel
loss curves (($\log(f)$) is the loss plotted on a log scale), pointing towards
you, arranged in order of the “step size” hyperparameter
(that’s ($\log(\alpha)$)). The orange curve represents a “short-term”
hyperparameter optimization, which is allowed to move along the “step size”
axis at each step. The “long-term” hyperparameter optimization instead
optimizes directly on the thick black dashed “U” — that is, after <em>several</em>
steps of training. You can see how the latter is smoother, but also much harder
to compute.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/fig-metasurface.png" alt="The preceding paragraph explains this
figure."></p>
<p>To summarize: the short-term way is cheap but noisy. The long-term way is
expensive but less noisy. Can we get the best of both worlds?</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, let’s think more carefully about the source of the expense. The problem
is that we need to store (or be able to reconstruct) the full computation graph
in order to do backpropagation. Okay, but do we really <em>need</em> to do
backpropagation? The only reason we backpropagate is that it’s more efficient
in the case when you want derivatives with respect to <em>many</em> different
variables. If you have millions of model parameters, backpropagation is
millions of times faster than the much simpler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Automatic_differentiation_using_dual_numbers">forward-mode (“dual numbers”)
automatic
differentiation</a>.</p>
<p>But we <em>don’t</em> have millions of <em>hyperparameters!</em> Step size, for example, is
just a single number. The Adam optimizer only has a total of 4 hyperparameters.
With this in mind, backpropagation isn’t even the right choice — we <em>should</em>
be using dual numbers for the hyperparameter optimization. On the other hand,
we should still be using backpropagation for the “inner loop” that optimizes
the (non-hyper-) parameters. That is, we want to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>initialize hyperparameters
# loop to optimize hyperparameters
while True:
  initialize parameters
  # loop to optimize parameters
  for i in range(100):
    run model on data to get loss
    # using reverse-mode!
    compute d(loss) / d(parameters)
    update parameters using hyperparameters
  # using forward-mode
  compute d(loss) / d(hyperparameters)
  update hyperparameters
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>(Update: I discovered that this was suggested in the 2017 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01785">Forward and
Reverse Gradient-Based Hyperparameter
Optimization</a>. But keep reading — while
the paper’s
<a href="https://github.com/lucfra/FAR-HO/blob/master/far_ho/hyper_gradients.py#L375">implementation</a>
needs a lot of math to be worked out manually, I’m going to show you how to
implement this in a way that makes all the math in the paper fall out “for
free”…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal raises a logistical question: how do we reconcile these two
automatic differentiation algorithms in the same program? <strong>The “trick” is to
“thread” dual numbers through a backpropagation implementation.</strong> In other
words, implement backpropagation as usual, but rather than <code>float</code> type
numbers, exclusively use <code>dual_number</code> type numbers (even when doing derivative
calculations). Initialize the system such that the dual numbers track
derivatives with respect to the hyperparameters you care about. Then, your
final loss value’s attached ($\epsilon$)-value <em>immediately</em> gives you
<code>d(loss)/d(hyperparameters)</code>. No backpropagation needed — and so, it’s safe
to “forget” the computation graph.</p>
<p>That’s it! That’s all I wanted to share in this blog post! :)</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not obvious how to implement this in PyTorch, since you can’t
naïvely do <code>tensor(dtype=dual_number)</code>. Rather than hack in a custom numeric
data type that implemented dual numbers, I wrote my own tiny implementations of
forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. It’s just a couple dozen
(very-recognizable-to-automatic-differentiation-enthusiasts) lines of code. I
was careful to make each implementation generic in the kind of “number” it
accepts. That allowed me to run the reverse-mode algorithms using the
forward-mode data types.</p>
<p>Running it on a simple quadratic optimization problem, we can see that updating
the hyperparameter ($\alpha$) yields better-looking loss curves — in this
GIF, we’re discovering that we should increase the step size. Yay!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/loss.gif" alt="GIF of loss curve becoming better over
time"></p>
<p>I think this is a very neat trick, which surely has other cool applications
(for example, differentiating through long-running physics simulations!). If
you’re curious, check out this <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/hybrid-hyperoptimization.ipynb">IPython
notebook</a> for
the full source code. Feel free to adapt it to your ideas. Then, tell me what
you’ve built!</p>

A good, blameless feedback culture is essential for working together efficiently as it forms healthy relationships, fuels personal and professional growth and aligns us with common norms. Feedback is one of the cornerstones of company culture.</p>
<p>All that said I’ve found that giving good feedback is quite problematic for most of the people (me included!). There’s a social stigma to giving so-called constructive feedback (see, even the name is somewhat of a euphemism), we feel we’re expected to be nice to each other and surely telling someone they were wrong is not nice. We also tend to be way too simple and not specific when giving praise - no, a simple ‘well done’ is usually not considered as useful feedback.</p>
<p>Let me share with you a few key points about giving useful feedback. I promise it’s all easy and trivial, you just need to consciously practice it.</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The how</h2>
<p>One of the most important things is getting buy-in for providing feedback. That gives back some of the control to the recipient and helps in having a more open mindset compared to unsolicited feedback. Simply ask if the other party is open to talk about the certain topics. Give some context so they can decide. E.g. “May I share some thoughts about the daily standup we had today?”
Be objective and be specific. These support each other, generalization tends to lead to giving feedback on perceived character traits which is a huge anti-pattern (“You always commit bad code.").
There are a few feedback models out there, what worked the best for me is the SBI (Situation - Behavior - Impact) model. This helps in giving enough context and specificity and being objective. An example: “During the standup today you didn’t mention you were blocked in your work and by this we missed our chance to deploy today, resulting in a delay in delivery.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use the feedback sandwich technique (starting with a compliment, then negative feedback, then an optional compliment again). Unfortunately it’s still something certain coaches suggest - my advice is that it’s not OK. There’s a reason some call it sh*t sandwich. It shows that you’re not confident in your communication and gives mixed signals, practically killing the actionability of your feedback.</li>
<li>Don’t include suggestions in your feedback! That’s the next step, but it’s not part of the feedback. It’s very easy to slip into this anti-pattern: “Why didn’t you just use library X? That would make so much sense”. First, this is not feedback, this is question, second it’s not objective but you’re talking about your opinion, not the other person’s behavior and its effect.</li>
<li>Follow the SBI model even for praises! We tend to oversimplify positive feedback. A pat on the shoulder, a thumbs-up or a ‘nice job!’ has its place and value but the point of positive feedback is more than just recognition: it’s also to make the other person understand what exactly went well in what context and how to repeat that in the future. It’s much nicer to hear “By helping me out with data about the costs during my presentation yesterday we successfully convinced the board to fund our roadmap, thank you for that!” vs. “Thx for the help!”</li>
<li>It’s even better to focus on data than behavior (if you can).</li>
<li>Always leave room for the other party to express their thoughts on the matter and even disagree. You can facilitate this by asking how they feel about the issue.</li>
<li>Make sure to agree on a course of actions together. It’s not enough to drop your feedback and leave. You can help guide this process but the ownership lies with the recipient of the feedback (and yes, they can choose not to take action but they should be clear about that and their reasons). Ask guiding questions like “What are our action items here?” or “How can we make sure next time you feel safe to talk about your blockers during standup?”.</li>
<li>Remember I said don’t generalize? Well if it’s a positive feedback it can actually help and encourage if you talk about patterns in the recipient’s behavior. “I’ve noticed that you give awesome presentations lately, for example this last time about Kubernetes….”</li>
<li>It’s completely OK to talk about your feelings in the situation you’re describing, just make sure you’re explicit about them being feelings and not facts. “When you interrupted me during my presentation last Tuesday I felt really disrespected and undervalued” (v.s. “You don’t respect me”).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-when">The when</h2>
<ul>
<li>Timely feedback is key. Give feedback as soon as you can - hopefully the same day the event that you’re giving feedback about happened. Why? First, both of you still have the context fresh in your minds, second, this way a mental connection is formed between action and reaction.</li>
<li>Unless you have good experience in it don’t give instant feedback. Make sure you give yourself some breathing space and time to consider how you want to deliver your message. This is especially true for emotionally loaded situations.</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb praise publicly and criticize privately. Of course it’s completely OK to repeat praise in a private setting and rephrase/clarify it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, giving good feedback is as much about forming the habit as skills. Make sure you practice it, I guarantee you can find good occasions almost each day if you look closely.</p>

<p>That is, I want to simplify working on the compiler itself to it being just a crate.
This section of the article expands on the comment I’ve made on the
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/experience-report-contributing-to-rust-lang-rust/12012/17?u=matklad">irlo</a>
a while ago.</p>
<p>Since a couple of months ago, I am slowly pivoting from doing mostly green field dev in the rust-analyzer’s code base to refactoring <code>rustc</code> internals towards merging the two.
The process has been underwhelming, and slow and complicated build process plays a significant part in this: I feel like my own productivity is at least five times greater when I work on <code>rust-analyzer</code> in comparison to <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>Before I go into details about my vision here, I want to give shout-outs to
<a href="https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum/">@Mark-Simulacrum</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mark-i-m">@mark-i-m</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jyn514">@jyn514</a>
who already did a lot of work on simplifying the build process in the recent several months.</p>
<p>Note that I am going to make a slightly deeper than “Rust in 20XX” dive into the topic, feel free to skip the rest of the post if technical details about bootstrapping process are not your cup of tea.</p>
<p>Finally, I also should warn that I have an intern advantage here — I have absolutely no idea about how Rust’s current build process works, so I tell how it should work from the position of ignorance. Without further ado,</p>
<div>
<h3 id="how-simple-could-the-build-process-be"><a href="#how-simple-could-the-build-process-be"></a>How Simple Could the Build Process Be?</h3>
<p><code>rustc</code> is a bootstrapping compiler.
This means that, to compile <code>rustc</code> itself, one needs to have a previous version of <code>rustc</code> available.
This <em>could</em> make compiler’s build process peculiar.
My thesis is that this doesn’t need to be the case, and that the compiler could be just a crate.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping does make this harder to see though, so, as a thought experiment, let’s imagine what would <code>rustc</code>'s build process look like were it not written in Rust.
Let’s imagine the world where <code>rustc</code> is implemented in Go.
How would one build and test this rust compiler?</p>
<p>First, we clone the <code>rust-lang/rust</code> repository.
Then we download the latest version of the Go compiler — as we are shipping <code>rustc</code> binaries to the end user, it’s OK to require a cutting-edge compiler.
But there’s probably some script or gvm config file to make getting the latest Go compiler easier.
After that, <code>go test</code> builds the compiler and runs the unit tests.
Unit tests take a snippet of Rust code as an input and check that the compiler correctly analyses the snippet: that the parse tree is correct, that diagnostics are emitted, that borrow checker correctly accepts or rejects certain problems.</p>
<p>What we can not check in this way is that the compiler is capable of producing a real binary which we can run (that is, <code>run-pass</code> tests).
The reason for that is slightly subtle — to produce a binary, compiler needs to link the tested code with the standard library.
But we’ve only compiled the compiler, we don’t have a standard library yet!</p>
<p>So, in addition to unit-tests, we also need somewhat ad-hoc integration tests, which assume that the compiler has been build already, use it to compile the standard library, and then compile, link, and run the corpus of the test programs.
Running std’s own <code>#[test]</code> tests is also a part of this integration testing.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see if the above setup has any bottlenecks:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Getting the Go compiler is fast and straightforward.
In fact, it’s reasonable to assume that the user already have a recent Go compiler installed, and that they are familiar with standard Go workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compiling <code>rustc</code> would take a little while.
On the one hand, Rust is a big language, and you need to spend quite a few lines of code to implement it.
On the other hand, compilers are very straightforward programs, which don’t do a lot of IO, don’t have to deal with changing business requirements and don’t have a lot of dependencies.
Besides, Go is a language known for fast compile times.
So, spending something like five minutes on a quad-core machine for compiling the compiler seems reasonable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, running unit-tests is a breeze: unit-tests do not depend on any state external to the test itself; we are testing pure functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first integration tests is compiling and <code>#[test]</code>ing <code>std</code>.
As <code>std</code> is relatively small, compiling it with our compiler should be relatively fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running tens of thousands of full integration tests will be slow.
Each such test would need to do IO to read the source code, write the executable, and run the process.
It is reasonable to assume that <em>most</em> of potential failures are covered with compiler’s and <code>std</code>'s unit tests.
But it would be foolish to rely solely on those tests — fully integrated test suite is important to make sure that compiler indeed does what it is supposed to, and it is vital to compare several independent implementations — who knows, maybe one day we’ll rewrite <code>rustc</code> from Go to Rust, and re-using compiler’s unit-tests would be much harder in that context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>So, it seems like except for the final integration test suite, there’s no complexity/performance bottlenecks in our setup for a from-scratch build.
The problem with integrated suite can be handled by running a subset of smoke tests by default, and only running the full set of integrated tests on CI.
Testing is embarrassingly parallel, so a beefy CI fleet should handle that just fine.</p>
<p>What about incremental builds?
Let’s say we want to contribute a change to <code>std</code>.
First time around, this requires building the compiler, which is unfortunate.
This is a one-time cost though, and it shouldn’t be prohibitive (or we will have troubles with changes to the compiler itself anyway).
We can also cheat here, and just download some version of <code>rustc</code> from the internet to check <code>std</code>.
This will mostly work, except for the bits where <code>std</code> and rustc need to know about each other (lang items and intrinsics).
For those, we can use <code>#[cfg(not(bootstrap))]</code> in the <code>std</code> to compile different code for older versions of the compiler.
This makes <code>std</code> implementation mind-bending though, so a better alternative might be to just make CI publish the artifacts for the compiler built off the master branch.
That is, if you only contribute to <code>std</code>, you download the latest compiler instead of building it yourself.
We have a trade off between implementation complexity and compile times.</p>
<p>If we want to contribute a change to the compiler, then we are golden as long as it can be checked by the unit-tests (which, again, in theory is everything except for <code>run-pass</code> tests).
If we need to run integrated tests with <code>std</code>, then we need to recompile <code>std</code> with the new compiler, after every change to the compiler.
This is pretty unfortunate, but:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you fundamentally need to recompile <code>std</code> (for example, you change lang-items), there’s no way around this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you don’t need to recompile <code>std</code>, than you probably can write an <code>std</code>-less unit-test,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as an escape hatch, there might be some kind of <code>KEEP_STDLIB</code> env var, which causes integrated tests to re-use existing <code>std</code>, even if the compiler is newer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To sum up, compiler is just a program which does some text processing.
In the modern world full of distributed highly-available long-running systems, compiler is actually a pretty simple program.
It also is fairly easy to test.
The hard bit is not the compiler itself, but the standard library: to even start building the standard library, we need to compile the compiler.
However, most of the compiler can be tested without <code>std</code>, and <code>std</code> itself can be tested using compiler binary built from the master branch by CI.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="why-todays-build-process-is-not-simple"><a href="#why-todays-build-process-is-not-simple"></a>Why Today’s Build Process is not Simple?</h3>
<p>In theory, it should be possible to replace Go from the last section with Rust, and get a similarly simple bootstrapping compiler.
That is, we would use latest stable/beta Rust to compile <code>rustc</code>, then we’ll use this <code>rustc</code> to compile <code><code>std</code></code>, and we are done.
We might add a sanity check — using the freshly built compiler &amp; <code>std</code>, recompile the compiler again and check that everything works.
This is optional, and in a sense just a subset of a crater run, where we check one specific crate — compiler itself.</p>
<p>However, today’s build is <em>more</em> complicated than that.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, instead of using a "standard distribution" of the compiler for bootstrapping, <code>x.py</code> downloads custom beta toolchain.
This could and should be replaced with using <code>rustup</code> by default.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, master <code>rustc</code> requires master <code>std</code> to build.
This is the bit which makes <code>rustc</code> not a simple crate.
Remember how before the build started with just compiling the compiler as a usual program?
Today, <code>rustc</code> build starts with compiling master <code>std</code> using the beta compiler, than with compiling master <code>rustc</code> using master <code>std</code> and beta compiler.
So, there’s a requirement that <code>std</code> builds with both master and beta compilers, and we also has this weird state where versions of compiler and <code>std</code> we are using to compile the code do not match. In other words, while <code>#[cfg(not(bootstrap))]</code> was an optimization in the previous section (which could be replaced with downloading binary <code>rustc</code> from CI), today it is required.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, there’s not much in a way of the unit tests in the compiler.
Almost all tests require <code>std</code>, which means that, to test anything, one needs to rebuild everything.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, LLVM &amp; linkers.
A big part of "compilers are easy to test" is the fact that they are, in theory, closed systems interacting with the outside world in a limited well-defined way.
In the real world, however, rustc relies on a bunch of external components to work, the biggest one of which is LLVM.</p></div></div></div>

								<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><em>A Logically investigation identifies a key QAnon figure as New Jersey resident Jason Gelinas. The investigation ties QAnon properties to a company owned by Gelinas, an information technology specialist who has held prominent positions at both Credit Suisse and Citigroup.</em></p>

<p><span>Ever since the shadowy figure known as Q made his first appearance on the 4chan imageboard in October of 2017, the author’s identity has remained a mystery. Since then, Q has posted thousands of ‘drops,’ converting legions of followers to the belief that Donald Trump is leading a global fight against a satanic cabal of child trafficking elites, commonly referred to in the QAnon world as the ‘Deep State’.</span></p>
<p>Over the years, Q’s posts would move from the 4chan forum to 8chan, and finally to its later iteration, 8kun. But these forums weren’t where most of Q’s followers would go to access the drops: most would find them neatly compiled on a site called QMap, now the main platform on which Q’s drops are published. For years it was believed that QMap was an endeavour that was independent of both the chan forums and the person or people posting Q’s drops, but recent discoveries concerning an IP address behind QMap raised questions as to whether Jim Watkins, the owner of 8chan and 8kun, an elusive figure in his own right, could also be Q. <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/who-is-qanon-jim-watkins-rumors/"><span>As some QAnon researchers have pointed out</span></a>, however, the story of Q’s operations does not end with Jim Watkins.</p>

<p>In the world of QAnon, the site qmap.pub is something of a sacred text. It’s a site designed to collect Q’s posts on other message boards and collate them in a searchable database; over the years, it has grown to include glossaries on themes, profiles on people named across the drops (handily sorted into ‘Evil’, ‘Traitor/Pawn’, and ‘Patriot’), and even a prayer wall.</p>
<p>Most followers of QAnon tend not to visit Q’s posts on 8kun and the ‘chan’ boards where they are initially posted (the vernacular used on those sites is deliberately exclusionary and newcomers are often put off). This makes qmap.pub a crucial port of call for all QAnon information and a major node in how the movement disseminates its lore. The site&nbsp;has been hitting over 10 million monthly users since April of this year.</p>
<p>The developer of QMap has been known only as ‘QAPPANON’ since the launch of the site in May of 2018. They have a successful Patreon where they regularly post and update their following on the running of the website. They pull in over 600 patrons and a $3,320 a month income - although there is a $4,000 a month target for ‘running costs’ of the website. In addition to the website, QMap also had an accompanying app on the Google Play Store (for $2.99) until <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-removes-qanon-apps-from-play-store-for-violating-terms/"><span>it was removed in May</span></a> this year as “harmful content”. The user QAPPANON is synonymous with qmap.pub, acting as its sole developer and mouthpiece.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The QAnon community recognizes the importance of QAPPANON and how central QMap is to how the movement functions. In a recent campaign to deplatform QAPPANON from Patreon, QAnon power-influencer Praying Medic leapt to their defence, calling on his nearly 400,000 Twitter followers to help (and funnelling them towards QAPPANON’s Patreon). In addition, Praying Medic linked to the Patreon on his podcast, describing it as the “Qmap Patreon”.</p>

<h4><strong><span>Who is behind QAPPANON?</span></strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/who-is-qanon-jim-watkins-rumors/"><span>It has been suspected that the owner of 8kun, Jim Watkins, is Q</span></a> and perhaps QAPPANON. A shared IP address for 8kun and qmap.pub was viewed as a significant link between Watkins and Q, placing him as a figure doing more than just hosting Q’s preferred method of communication. If Watkins was not in fact Q, his hosting of QMap suggested that at the very least, he could “become Q whenever he wanted”. When approached by Daily Dot, however, QAPPANON stated “they are ‘not associated with Watkins’ and that they moved to VanwaTech because “QMap suffers denial of service attacks regularly, hence the need for a content delivery network that could stop it.”</p>

<h4><strong><span>Logically Investigation into QAPPANON’s identity</span></strong></h4>
<p>Our investigation can reveal that QAPPANON is not Watkins, but instead a New Jersey man in his forties with prominent roles in technical analysis and IT security for the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QAPPANON’s email address was initially discovered during our investigation into QMap’s translation efforts and international reach. A now-deleted Facebook post allowed us to trace the email to a CNET&nbsp;download cache for the QMap app as well as a new app in development called Armor of God.</p>

<p>The email found here in the URL serves as a point of contact in a call for translators for qmap.pub. Importantly, the post here states that “<strong><em>Q</em></strong> is looking for someone” rather than “QMap is looking for someone.” As Watkins’s connection to QMap has resulted in speculation that he could be Q, the connection here should not be ignored. However, this may be the result of Shirley_is believing that Q speaks through qmap.pub. What this post <em>does </em>indicate is that QAPPANON is directly responsible for hiring translators for QMap, and therefore has employees.</p>
<p>An extraction of QAPPANON’s email address from the URL led to their developer profile and list of created apps on CNET. While the qmap app is well known at this point, Armor of God is relatively new, having been uploaded on the 18th June 2020.</p>

<h5><span><strong>Armor of God:</strong></span></h5>
<p>When investigating Armor of God, we were met with a bare sign-up screen. Attempts to register and investigate the platform both on desktop and mobile versions were met with login errors and no email to confirm registration or change passwords. This led us to believe that, while downloadable on app stores, the platform is not yet up and running.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the “get the Android app” link led to the Google Play store. Here, we can see that QAPPANON is listed as the profile responsible for uploading the app.</p>

<p>However, further down, we can see a different entity listed as the developer of Armor of God: Patriot Platforms.</p>

<p>Therefore, far from being a rogue developer creating QMap, QAPPANON has a company—and a company must be filed for.</p>

<p>Jason J. Gelinas, an information technology specialist from Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, whose CV lists prominent positions with both Credit Suisse and Citigroup, is the founder and sole employee of Patriot Platforms LLC, which is credited as the developer behind the QMap and Armor of God platforms. Gelinas’s home address is, in fact, a mere seven-minute drive from Patriot Platforms LLC’s listed P.O. box, also in Berkeley Heights; further investigation shows the connection between Gelinas’s personal WhatsApp and Patriot Platforms’ listed phone number.</p>

<p>So does that mean Gelinas <em>is </em>Q? No. In fact, it’s quite unlikely that someone such as Gelinas would have been involved in the very early (i.e. 4chan) days of Q. It does suggest, however, that after the success of the QMap platform since it was launched in 2018, a direct line was opened between Watkins and Gelinas, as well as Q (if we are to believe that Q is actually an independent third party and whether the Q from the early days is the Q of today). Indeed, as <span>creator and former owner of 8chan </span>Fred Brennan told Logically, Watkins essentially operates Vanwatech, the company hosting both 8kun and QMap, meaning that he can offer Gelinas free or negligible running costs for QMap, which then reframes the monthly income from Patreon.</p>
<p>So how close is all this to Q? In a nutshell, it’s closer than we’ve ever been. In fact, recent Q drops discussing the ‘Armor of God’ prayer more and more frequently coincide almost perfectly with attempts to launch the ‘Armor of God’ platform, giving this the feel of a coordinated PR campaign. Of course, that could be down to the tendency among Q’s followers to use and re-use the same language, but given the established connection between Gelinas and Watkins, the fact that this timing suggests a level of coordination should not be dismissed.&nbsp;</p></span>

Generally, grafts have been thought to be compatible only between the same or closely related species. However, scientists at Nagoya University and colleagues in Japan recently found that the tobacco plant Nicotiana benthamiana promotes adhesion of tissue and can maintain grafts between a broad range of species.</p><p>Their findings, published recently in the journal <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.sciencemag.org%2Fcontent%2F369%2F6504%2F698&amp;t=NzMyZTkzZTdkYTNkZTg1ZDBhN2QxY2MzNjYxMzg4NGQwMzIxYTI4NSxLUkQyYlUzcA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629086794241146880%2Fplant-grafting-enzyme&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600173014">Science</a></i>, have also shown that using tobacco as an intermediary, the upper part (scion) of a tomato plant grafted onto the lower part (rootstock) of a Chrysanthemum morifolium (widely known as Florist’s daisy) successfully bore fruit.</p><p>Grafting has been conducted for thousands of years for the propagation of fruits and vegetables, in which a productive scion is attached onto a rootstock that is resistant to diseases and environmental stresses. However, exactly how grafts are established has been unclear, and grafting is considered difficult between different family species.</p><p>A team of scientists from Nagoya University, Teikyo University, RIKEN, Chubu University, and GRA&amp;GREEN Inc. (a start-up venture company from Nagoya University) recently conducted a study on grafting between different family species.</p><p>The team focused on Nicotiana in the Solanaceae family, because a previous study had shown that its scion can be grafted onto the rootstock of Arabidopsis thaliana in the mustard family. The team conducted grafting experiments using plants of seven Nicotiana species and their partners from 84 species in 42 families. The results showed that Nicotiana, used as either scion or rootstock, succeeded in maintaining grafts for more than a month with 73 species in 38 families.</p><p>Next, the scientists examined the cellular mechanisms that enable Nicotiana to form grafts with plants from a wide range of families. They analyzed transcriptomes at graft junctions between Nicotiana and Arabidopsis and hypothesized that the expression of β-1,4 glucanases secreted into the extracellular region is involved in cell wall digestion. In further experiments, when β-1,4 glucanases were overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the adhesion property of the grafts was enhanced. Thus, they concluded that the expression of β-1,4 glucanases is a key in facilitating tissue adhesion of the grafts.</p><figure data-orig-height="619" data-orig-width="663"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/082142bf46b3e14344cceee445b4bc75/4e015cafafd66f54-4c/s1280x1920/2fae36a6abac4368ff018bebe2676d7f003fee22.png" data-orig-height="619" data-orig-width="663" width="663" height="619" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Using tobacco as an interscion, a tomato scion was grafted onto a rootstock of Chrysanthemum (Florist’s daisy), one of the most prolific plants on land.Three monthslater, the tomato plant bore a small fruit.

  <article>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosions">August 4th explosions in Beirut</a> were very jarring to me due to the loss of human life, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNDhIGR-83w">numerous</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGEmD6j8diU">direct</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwRF5liTGB4">videos</a> that looked like something out my 80s youth nightmares. Hearing that it was caused by 2,750 tonnes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a>, I started working on my phone to quantify my fear by figuring out how easy it would be to ship that much, and how much it would cost.</p>

<p>According to wikipedia, there were at least 171 deaths; 6,000 injuries; 300,000 people homeless; and US$10-15 billion in destruction with a blast radius causing damage up to two miles away. <sup id="fnref:nytimes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nytimes">1</a></sup></p>

<p>After my initial shock, I heard 2,750 tonnes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> mentioned in the news but didn’t know much about that and wanted to know how big that was. It surprised me that it seems to cost a little over half a million to buy and ship this much It ends up being really cheap, really common, and really small and that scared me by how simple of a risk this is for misuse. I’m hoping that anti-terrorism agencies are working to prevent this but since I didn’t see much coverage on this, I’m posting my notes here in case others were doing similar research.</p>

<p>If you can, please consider donating to help those impacted. Choosing a charity is hard, but I noticed that <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1291772262530637824">Nassim Nicholas Taleb recommended</a> <a href="https://www.seal-usa.org/BeirutEmergencyFund">Beirut Emergency Fund 2020</a>, a co-worker recommended <a href="http://www.redcross.org.lb/index.aspx?pageid=907">Lebanese Red Cross</a>, and Google has a nice <a href="https://donate.google.com/checkout?campaignid=5303526385319936&amp;tab=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;authUser=0">Donate with Google</a> page set up with the Center for Disaster Philanthropy.</p>

<p>This is unrelated to technology, but I think random researching outside of comfort areas is really important for design and debugging. Also, I think user empathy is really important for figuring out the solution so I frequently have to learn about whatever is important to my users. That being said, if this isn’t interesting, please skip.</p>

<h2 id="my-question">My question</h2>

<p>My initial wondering was “what is ammonium nitrite and how big is 2,750 tonnes of it?” And that led to a chain of reasoning that made me worry more and more…</p>

  <li>How much would it cost to buy that much?</li>
  <li>How much would it cost to ship to that to a harbor near New York?</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing here was too complicated but it ate up part of Sunday morning while my wife and I were watching the news. I work on trying to collect references for lines of reasoning and so I started bookmarking some sites as I answered each of these questions.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-the-arithmetic">Breaking down the arithmetic</h2>

<p>There are many assumptions I made and I’m not experienced in chemistry or mining or export or shipping so I think that I’m likely quite a bit off in my calculations, so I figure I may be off by a power of 10. But that’s a big caveat before I start making naive calculations.</p>

<h3 id="how-big">How big?</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate">Ammonium nitrate</a> is commonly used as a fertilizer and as an industrial explosive. To figure out how much space this much would take up I want to multiply out by its density. According to wikipedia the density of ammonium nitrate is 1.725 grams / cm3, <sup id="fnref:wikipedia_am" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_am">2</a></sup> so to figure out how much space this takes up I need to convert this mass to a dimension.</p>

<pre><code>1 metric ton = 1,000,000 grams = 1,000 kilograms = 1 megagram
1,000,000 / 1.725 = 579710.144927536231884 cm3 = .5797 m3 = 20.47 cubic feet
2,750 * .5797 = 1594.175 m3
</code></pre>

<p><sup id="fnref:wikipedia_tonne" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_tonne">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So a single tonne of ammonium nitrate takes up .5797 m3 or 20.47 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Why did I convert that to cubic feet? I wanted to try to think of that in car cargo size and those are displayed in cubic feet.</p>

<p>So a BMW 330 Gran Turismo hatchback has a 18.4 cubic foot capacity with the seats up and 56.5 with the seats down. <sup id="fnref:bmw_330gt_cargo_specs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bmw_330gt_cargo_specs">4</a></sup> So it won’t fit a whole tonne with the seats up, but it can hold almost three with the seats down. Of course, the axles can’t bear even a half tonne so it’s moot for reality, but I’m now thinking of 2,750 tonnes in terms of hatchbacks.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/bmw-3-series-gt-rear-quarter.jpg" alt="Fortunately, not full of ammonium nitrate"></p>

<p>So, the entire batch of ammonium nitrate in Beirut takes up 1594 m3. That’s too big to think of in hatchbacks, how many shipping containers is that?</p>

<p>A shipping container, or an intermodal container, are those standard sized steel boxes that we see on trucks and stacked up in ports and is used for shipping pretty much everything for freight transport. They come in 20 foot and 40 foot versions and shipping is described in twenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs. This is one of those funny situations where the standard is in imperial units (kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_code">tire sizes</a>) but the dimensions are 6.1m long, 2.6m high, and 2.9m wide and have an internal volume of 33.1 m3. <sup id="fnref:wikipedia_tfe" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_tfe">5</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>1594.175 / 33.1 = 48.16238670694864
</code></pre>

<p>So 2,750 tonnes takes up 48.16 TEU shipping containers. Still kind of hard to visualize. How many does one of those cargo ships carry? Is 50 containers a lot?</p>

<p>Modern container ships can carry over 23,000 TEUs. <sup id="fnref:wikipedia_container_ship" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_container_ship">6</a></sup> So 50 containers is just a fraction of the overall cargo.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/loaded_container_ship.jpeg" alt="See if you can spot the .217% of the TEUs that contain 2,750 tonnes"></p>

<p>So I can kind of visualize 50 TEUs and the neat web site <a href="http://www.bluebulbprojects.com/MeasureOfThings/results.php?amt=1500&amp;comp=volume&amp;p=1&amp;sort=pr&amp;unit=cm">The Measure of Things</a> tells me that’s 3/4 the size of a hot air balloon.</p>

<p>So big, but not humongous. Certainly something that the Joker or Simon Gruber could arrange to ship with 25-50 semi trucks.</p>

<h3 id="how-expensive">How expensive?</h3>

<p>How much would this much cost? The price seems to vary depending on country, this chart from 2007 shows the cheapest price from Russia at $156/tonne. [^pricing] And the current retail price on Alibaba.com is $192-217/tonne. <sup id="fnref:alibaba_price" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:alibaba_price">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The world’s total output was 21.6 tonnes in 2017 and the top five producing countries were Russia (9.9M), Egypt (4.3M), Uzbekistan (1.4M), the US (1.4M), and Poland (1.3M).</p>

<p>So 2,750 seems like a purchasable amount. Assuming that the 2007 price from Russia is reasonable for a bulk price gets us to $429,000 as the raw cost of the material.</p>

<pre><code>156 x 2,750 = $429,000
</code></pre>

<h3 id="how-much-to-ship">How much to ship?</h3>

<p>So if a bad guy has 50 containers full of ammonium nitrate, how much does that cost to ship?</p>

<p>An explosion in any US port would be terrible, but just to estimate prices I calculated shipping it to the Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn, NY as a two mile radius from there would reach much of New York City.</p>

<p><a href="https://ship.freightos.com/">Freightos.com</a> shows that four quotes of 50 containers shipped from St. Petersburg, Russia (RULED) to New York (USNYC) range from $106,200-138,000 and will take 13-19 days.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So it seems like the total cost to purchase and ship 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate is $567,000. That seems way too cheap to cause so much damage.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/europe/lebanon-russian-ship-blast-intl/index.html">CNN</a>, the fertilizer was on a Russian ship called the MVRhosus and was bound for Madagascar when it stopped in Beirut.</p>

<p>This is one of those risks that I don’t know any way to practically cope with, so I have to trust that multiple government agencies are working every day making sure stuff like this doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>But if someone is working on a Bond script, or an Austin Powers script, this might eventually show up in a story.</p>

<h2 id="all-the-calculations-together">All the calculations together</h2>

<pre><code>$156 x 2,750 tonnes = $429,000
1,000,000 grams / 1.725 g/cm3 = 579710.144927536231884 cm3 = .5797 m3
2,750 tonnes * .5797 m3 = 1594.175 m3
1594.175 m3 / 33.1 m3/TEU = 48.16238670694864 TEU
$429,000 chemicals + $138,000 shipping = $567,000
</code></pre>

<h2 id="unanswered-questions">Unanswered questions</h2>

<p>Questions I didn’t find that definitely impact overall cost:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m not sure what mixture and ingredients are needed beyond raw ammonium nitrate.</li>
  <li>I’m not sure if stacked containers will result in a similar explosion.</li>
  <li>Not sure how much it costs to rent all those containers.</li>
  <li>St. Petersburg may not be the best shipping port from Russia.</li>

<blockquote><p>I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.</p><cite>Martin Luther King Jr.</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the disappointing aspects of race discussions in the media today, is that they predominantly focus on anecdotes and sensational examples. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outlookzen.com/2020/07/11/how-to-hack-the-human-brain/" target="_blank">Stories are wonderful at illustrating truths, but are a horrible way of proving them</a>. Is there a more quantifiable way of evaluating race relations in America today?</p>



<p>One objective metric that comes to mind, is rates of interracial marriage, normalized by society’s level of diversity. This single metric encompasses a wealth of different information – including housing/education/career segregation, societal attitudes towards embracing diversity, and close social ties that bridge racial divides. And most conveniently, interracial marriages and their resulting children are explicitly surveyed by a number of sources, such as the US Census. This makes it far easier to quantify them, as compared to more nebulous signals such as “friendships” and “social circles”.</p>



<p>One major disclaimer – it is certainly not my intention to embarrass anyone who is married to a partner of the same race. Indeed, the vast majority of people, regardless of race, marry someone of the same race. Often purely by coincidence. And other times because of people’s understandable desire to be with someone who shares their culture and world view – something often mentioned by people of color as well. The goal of this study is not to “call out” any individuals, but simply to examine wider societal trends.</p>



<h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>



<p>The best data source I could find was the US Census – specifically the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=DP05&amp;t=Race%20and%20Ethnicity&amp;tid=ACSDP1Y2018.DP05&amp;hidePreview=false" target="_blank">American Community Survey</a>. This survey provides racial demographic information, broken down by state and city. Unfortunately it doesn’t explicitly give us statistics for interracial marriage. But it does give us a different statistic which we can use as a proxy – the percentage of people who are biracial, broken down by each race-combination.</p>



<p>To be sure, this is a flawed proxy. Not all couples have the same number of children. Not to mention that the percentage of biracial individuals, is a lagging indicator of today’s rate of interracial marriages. These drawbacks make it very hard to use the metrics below in any absolute sense. But they are still of great value when used in a relative context.</p>



<p>The methodology we use to quantify racial integration is simple. In a world of complete racial integration, if X% of society is Black, then each person would have a X% likelihood of marrying someone who is Black. This implies that in a society that is:<br>– X% White,<br>– Y% Black,&nbsp;<br>we would expect <code><strong>2*X*Y/100</strong></code> % of individuals in the subsequent generation to be White-Black biracial.</p>



<p>Given the above, we can then score each society’s level of integration by computing the actual:expected biracial population ratio.</p>



<p>For example, in a hypothetical colorblind society consisting of 90 White and 10 Black citizens, each person would have a 10% chance of marrying a Black person. This implies that of the resulting 50 marriages, 9 of them (ie, 18%) would be White-Black. We would then expect 18% of children in the following generation to be White-Black biracial. If the actual biracial demographic is 1%, our racial integration score would be <strong><code>1/18 ~= 0.055 ~= 5.5%</code></strong></p>



<p>The above methodology has been coded into a software application, which parses the Census data and computes all the scores. <a href="https://gitlab.com/whacks/sandbox/-/blob/master/src/main/java/org/rajivprab/sandbox/census_analysis/Census.java">Both the code and the dataset can be found here</a>, and is readily available for you to modify and/or run directly.</p>



<h2><strong>Limitations</strong></h2>



<p>The above methodology has many weaknesses of course. Chief among them, it doesn’t take into account age. Ideally, we would be looking only at the 20-40 demographic, in order to best estimate the expected fraction of interracial marriages. And we should also be looking only at the 0-10 demographic, in order to estimate the actual fraction of recent marriages that are interracial. Or even better, we should be measuring directly the fraction of recent marriages that are interracial, without having to rely on any other proxy. In the absence of more precise data, we are forced to make do with the above approximations instead.</p>



<p>More fundamentally, in order to truly quantify segregation, we should be looking at all social ties – not just marriages. It is possible for an African-American couple to be perfectly integrated into society, with friends, neighbors and colleagues of all backgrounds, and this methodology fails to capture that.</p>



<p>Lastly, this study uses marriage as a proxy for social integration. But arguably, we should be looking at other measures such as wellbeing, societal attitudes, and levels of discrimination experienced. Just because someone is in an interracial marriage, does not mean that they feel comfortable and welcomed by the wider society around them. And the converse is true as well.</p>



<p>Given the above limitations, this study should definitely be supplemented with other studies that explore this topic from different angles. The absolute scores computed are of minimal use on their own. But when used in a relative manner to compare different communities, it gives us some very objective, quantifiable and data-driven insights.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was shocked by how much the states differed from one another. When looking at the states with the lowest scores, we see extremely low levels of interracial marriage. A mere 0.7% of people in Mississippi identify as White-Black biracial. Despite the fact that 58% of Mississippi is White and <strong>38%</strong> is Black. In contrast, New Hampshire has the <strong>exact same</strong> biracial demographic, despite the fact that <strong>less than 2%</strong> of people in New Hampshire are Black.</p>

<p>An excerpt from the Symbolics Genera Manual.</p>
<div>
<p><a name="t2"></a>Genera - The Best Software Environment Available</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>To all our new users: Welcome.</p>

</div>
<p>This conceptual introduction explains what your Symbolics computer is all about. We urge you to at least skim it before you start daily work with the system. We try here to summarize some of the "big picture" concepts in your new software environment; knowing about this framework will help you in learning its details more efficiently.</p>
<p>Most new users of Symbolics machines have worked on traditional time-sharing systems, such as VAX/VMS, or on microcomputers or conventional UNIX workstations. ("Genera Comparison Charts" shows some equivalents between these systems and Genera.) If you feel somewhat uneasy about learning how to use the most advanced software environment around, relax!</p>
<p>You don't have to learn everything at once in order to do anything - look at this as a long-term, incremental learning project. You don't have to learn everything by yourself. Our documentation and Genera itself are here to help you.</p>
<p>Genera and Symbolics Common Lisp dramatically increase your productivity and efficiency by providing many built-in software facilities (similar to library routines) that you would otherwise have to write yourself. Our edit-compile-debug cycle happens so fast that you are virtually editing, compiling, and debugging simultaneously. The editor, compiler and debugger are all resident utilities, available anytime, anywhere.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 1. Your view of Genera's command level.</p>
<p>Genera has no "command levels" or separate "command environments" - you can get there from here. You can move directly from any application to any other application, usually with just two keystrokes. You do not have to close one application to enter another. (See Figure 1.)</p>
<p>Many different activities, such as the editor and electronic mail, run at the same time in separate processes. That means you can move around the system from one application to another without affecting the state of other applications. For example, you can move directly from editing a file to reading online documentation to sending mail and back to editing the file.</p>
<p>To illustrate the basic environmental concept, suppose for a moment the house you live in were like a conventional software environment. The electricity would be in one room, the telephone in another, the heat in another, and the tap water in another. To access one facility, you would have to leave the other behind, moving back to a central access hallway that opened onto all the other rooms.</p>
<p>Suppose you were talking on the telephone in the telephone room. If you wanted to turn on the light in order to write something down, you would have to leave the telephone room, and go to the electricity room. If you then wanted to wash your hands, you would have to leave the electricity room and go to the water room. It would be unthinkable to use the heat, light, or telephone in the water room.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 2. House as Operating System. This house design has central heating, electricity in every room, and so on. That is, basic services are available or accessible in every context.</p>
<p>Continuing this analogy, with a house designed like Genera, you could access electricity, heat, water, telephone, vacuuming, and so forth, from every room (Figure 2)! As you will see when you learn more about Genera, you can access a Genera activity in many different ways as well.</p>
<p>In a conventional computer system, the operating system is the foundation and other separate software application programs are layered on top of the operating system. The command level (exec, monitor, or shell) controls access to the operating system's facilities as well as access to (invoking and terminating) the application programs (Figure 3).</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure3.gif" alt="Figure 3"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 3. Traditional operating systems require the user to interact with a command monitor in order to access applications and the facilities of the operating system.</p>
<p>Genera is your whole environment; it encompasses what you normally think of as an operating system as well as everything else - system commands and all other activities. From where you look at it, there is no "top-level" controller or exec.</p>
<p>All Genera activities are themselves Lisp functions, based on a pool of thousands of Lisp functions, all implemented in Lisp. Below those, it's just the hardware - you never need to deal with a lower-level internal implementation language.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure4.gif" alt="Figure 4"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 4. The Lisp Environment, consisting of all the function and data objects in virtual memory. Activities are just collections of functions and data.</p>
<p>Genera is intelligent. Its many processes can communicate with each other, and they all automatically share data. Genera keeps an internal record of the history of almost everything that happens in the system - command history, output history, process history, window history, and so on.</p>
<p>Histories make it possible to use previous output on a window as input to a command. The mouse can select a relevant piece of output anywhere on the screen because the history mechanism keeps track of the data object types of all the output. As a result, the reusable output is completely context-sensitive.</p>
<p>For example, clicking on a filename in a directory listing displays the contents of the file. When a command needs a filename argument, clicking on that same filename gives the file to the command as an argument. The meaning of the clicks is both context-sensitive and intuitive. You can scoop up a piece of output in one activity and enter it as input to another activity in a matter of seconds. With just a few keystrokes, you can find, modify, and reuse a command that you entered earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The key to Genera's intelligence is the sharing of knowledge and information among all activities. At any time, the collection of all the state of all the processes is called the environment (Figure 4). Any function running in any process can use any piece of data in the environment directly. You do not need laborious special-purpose protocols or intermediate files.</p>
<p>The entire software environment, in its pristine unused state, ready for booting, is saved on disk as a world. A world consists of all the Lisp objects (functions, variables, windows, processes, and so on) that make up the software environment. The world contains the fully initialized environment, ready to boot and use.</p>
<p>Genera doesn't draw any boundaries around itself. It is customizable and extensible by design. Unlike most software, it has an open architecture; you can change anything that is part of Genera. In fact, we encourage you to take advantage of this and to build your applications as extensions of Genera.</p>
<p>The extensibility of the system is possible thanks to both its modular design and its implementation, using highly flexible, object-oriented data structures called flavors. Any data object defined by a flavor or class can be customized or extended cleanly.</p>
<p>Object-oriented data structures are at the heart of symbolic processing because they allow abstract descriptions of data and operations in terms that fit well with the application. The data objects are essentially models of the real-world objects they are implementing. Thus programming uses a problem-solving vocabulary that matches the terminology of the problem domain.</p>
<p>Genera itself was designed to be extended in a number of different ways. You can set customizing variables and create simple files of personal initializations (called init files), or you can extend or replace parts of Genera itself in order to create your own special application.</p>
<p>When you write a program, it becomes an extension of Genera itself (Figure 5). What you do becomes part of the world and enriches the software environment. Because you have loaded a world into your own standalone machine, you can customize and extend the system without affecting the work of others. To get a fresh world, simply boot your machine again.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure5.gif" alt="Figure 5"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 5. Your Programs Become an Extension of Genera.</p>
<p>To sum things up, its built-in features, open architecture, intelligence, and extensibility make Genera a new breed of software environment. Genera can help you perform tough software development tasks more quickly than you ever imagined possible.</p>
<p>As you delve deeper into the conceptual material in the next chapters, and then begin to get hands-on practice with Genera in the workbook, do not feel overwhelmed. You shouldn't put pressure on yourself to learn all about a revolutionary new software environment in a day or two. Take it easy. Try things out. Master a little at a time. Genera fosters an incremental approach in all things, including its own mastery.</p>
<p>Genera has amazing functionality and flexibility - often you can perform any task in any application in several different ways. But do not equate high flexibility and functionality with low usability! Genera is also ultimately the most usable software environment available. We want you to explore our functionality at your own pace. There is virtually no limit to the capabilities you will discover in Genera. And Genera will not place artificial upper limits on your creativity.</p>

<div>
<p>The Road to Symbolic Computing</p>

</div>
<p>What's the central philosophy behind the evolution of computing in general and Genera in particular?
Free programmers from thinking about unnecessary details and they can accomplish more. The more abstractly they are allowed to think, the bigger and harder the problems they can solve.</p>
<p>Some major advances in the history of conventional computing were motivated by this philosophy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assembly language. To avoid having to program in ones and zeros, assemblers were invented and programmers were able to express instructions to the computer mnemonically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-level languages. To avoid having to think about the computer hardware and instructions when solving a problem, high-level programming languages such as FORTRAN were invented. These allowed programmers to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

						<p><em>Der CCC richtet in diesem Jahr erstmalig die Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) statt einer Veranstaltung vor Ort in Leipzig aus.<br>
</em><em>Dafür braucht es Kreativität, Experimentierfreude und tatkräftige Unterstützung.</em></p>
<p>[<a href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/#english">English Version below</a>]</p>
<p>Eine Präsenzveranstaltung mit 17.000 Menschen wird in diesem Jahr weder verantwortungsvoll noch legal durchführbar sein.<br>
Aber nach der Durststrecke 2020 haben wir uns ein schönes Jahresende redlich verdient! Deshalb wird es die rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience geben.<br>
Wir wollen so viel wie möglich von Freude, Inhalten, Zusammensein und wunderbarem Wahnsinn transportieren, die einen Chaos Communication Congress ausmachen.</p>
<p>Hackerinnen sind remote-Arbeit und -Zusammenkünfte gewohnt. Umso wichtiger ist das jährliche persönliche Treffen.<br>
Natürlich wird es schwierig, all den Wahnsinn online abzubilden, der den Congress für uns ausmacht.<br>
Doch dann sagte jemand, es wäre unmöglich. Unser Ehrgeiz war geweckt.<br>
Wir wollen sehen, wie sich die geballte Energie und Kreativität der Hackerinnen dieser Herausforderung widmet.</p>
<h2>Was erwartet mich?</h2>
<p>Die rC3 wird eine Vielzahl von <strong>kleinen lokalen Events</strong> in den örtlichen Hackspaces <strong>mit einem gemeinsamen Programm</strong> von gestreamten Talks, Online-Workshops, Kunst, Kultur und verschiedensten Formen des vernetzten Zusammenseins.</p>
<p>In den vergangenen Monaten konnte der Club mit dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digital verteilten Online-Chaos</a> wichtige Erfahrungen sammeln. Für die rC3 gilt es, noch darüber hinauswachsen. Dafür werden alle gebraucht, die mitmachen und mitgestalten wollen.</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mich einbringen?</h2>
<p>Du hattest schon immer großartige Ideen für den Congress – aber dir hat der Platz dafür gefehlt?<br>
Physische Limitierungen schränken dich ohnehin nur unnötig ein?</p>
<p>Willkommen im Internet! Hier können wir bisher für unmöglich gehaltene Dinge entwickeln!<br>
Endlich kann auch dein Wohnzimmer oder euer Hackspace zur Bühne, zum weltweiten Workshop-Space, zur Kunst-Installation werden!</p>
<p>Unser aller Kreativität ist es, die den Congress für alle zum Wunderland macht.<br>
Die vielen Workshops sind es, die jedes Jahr jung und alt für Neues begeistern.<br>
Großartige Vorträge vermitteln jedes Jahr neues Wissen aus Wissenschaft, Technik und Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>Was sind Deine Ideen für eine Online-Welt?</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mitgestalten? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In den nächsten Wochen wird es <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">an dieser Stelle</a> einen Call for Participation geben. Die Content-Track-Teams freuen sich schon auf eure kreativen Einreichungen und Format-Ideen!</p>
<p>Bis dahin wollen wir Ideen sammeln, wie wir zusammen die rC3 gestalten wollen.<br>
Was erwarten wir von einer Remote-Veranstaltung?<br>
Welche neuen Formate, Spiele und Easter-Eggs sind möglich?<br>
Was können wir beitragen?<br>
Und welche Fehler sollten die C3-Teams beim Planen vermeiden?</p>
<p>Wir freuen uns über jedes Input unter<br>

<p><em>This year, CCC hosts the Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) instead of an on-site event in Leipzig.<br>
This endeavor requires creativity, joy of experimentation and active support.</em></p>
<p>A face-to-face event with 17,000 people will be neither responsible nor legally feasible this year. But after this tedious and painful 2020, we really deserve a nice finale!<br>
This is why the rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience will be held.<br>
As much as virtually possible, we want to convey the joy, content, togetherness and wonderful madness that make up a Chaos Communication Congress.</p>
<p>Hackers are used to remote work and online meetings. This makes our annual face-to-face meetings all the more important. Of course, it will be difficult to re-enact online all the things that make Congress what it is for us.<br>
But then someone said it would be impossible. Our ambition was aroused.<br>
Just like every year, we want to see the concentrated energy and creativity of hackers with dedication.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>rC3 will be a variety of <strong>distributed small local events</strong> in hackspaces <strong>with a joint program </strong>of streamed talks, online workshops, art, culture and various forms of networked togetherness.</p>
<p>In recent months, CCC has gained quite some experience with <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digitally distributed online chaos</a> events.<br>
With rC3, we want to grow even beyond that. For this, we need everyone who wants to participate and help shape rC3.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>You always had great ideas for Congress – but you lacked the space for it?<br>
Common restrictions of the physical world are annoying limitations to your creativity anyway?</p>
<p>Welcome to the Internet! Here, we can develop things that have been impossible so far!<br>
Finally, your living room or hackspace can become a stage, a worldwide workshop space, an art installation!</p>
<p>It’s all our creativity that makes the Congress a wonderland for everyone.<br>
It is the many workshops that inspire young and old for new things every year.<br>
Great lectures convey new knowledge from science, technology and society every year.</p>
<p>What are your ideas for an online gathering?</p>
<h2>How can I bring in my ideas? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In the next weeks, there will be a Call for Participation <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">at this site</a>. The content track teams are already looking forward to your creative submissions and format ideas!</p>
<p>Until then, we want to collect ideas on how we want to unfold rC3 together.<br>
What do we expect from a remote event?<br>
What new formats, games and easter-eggs are possible?<br>
What can we contribute?<br>
And what mistakes should the C3 teams avoid while planning?</p>
<p>We are looking forward to any input under<br>
<strong><a href="https://content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay/">content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay</a></strong></p>
<h2>When is it again?</h2>
<p>Save the date:<br>
December 27-30, 2020<br>
Online and in your local hackspace with your preferred infection community</p>

      <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unlike the Terminator-like humanoids that may come to mind when you hear the phrase ‘killer robots’, lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) can take many forms that are more like the weapons deployed today, such as drones, tank turrets, submarines, missile-defense systems, and sentry robots. The common thread pulling LAWS together is lethal autonomy: the ability for these weapons to select and engage with objects, including people or military targets, without human help.</li>
  <li>With AI and robotics technology rapidly advancing, experts are warning that so-called ‘killer robots’ (or more formally, LAWS) are just years, not decades, away from the battlefield. To date no country has deployed LAWS to the battlefield, although at least a dozen are developing them and the technology is advanced enough to do so.</li>
  <li>The US military is a world leader in the technical as well as ethical and legal development of killer robots. In 2012, it issued Directive 3000.09 codifying the rule that people hold the reins and retain meaningful control over the use of LAWS. Then, earlier this year the Department of Defense adopted a set of 5 ethical principles to guide the development and use of autonomous weapon systems.</li>
  <li>While the US is a leader in the area, the AI arms race is global: at least 12 nations have acknowledged that they are developing LAWS, and global spending on automated weapon systems is projected to reach $16 billion by 2025.</li>
  <li>The AI arms race is accelerating, because no strong state wants to tie its military’s hands from using powerful technology by agreeing to an international ban. Despite warnings that killer robots are driving a third revolution in warfare after gunpowder and nuclear weapons, states and international institutions are struggling to agree on how to regulate LAWS, if at all. Diplomats have been meeting at the UN for six years to discuss killer robots, but little progress towards a ban, treaty, or arms control agreement has been made.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>For many people, “killer robots” bring to mind dystopian images from science fiction, such as the human-like androids of <em>Bladerunner</em> or Arnold Schwartzenegger’s intimidating Terminator robot. While such robots that are frequently portrayed in the media are still entirely fictional, real-world “killer robots” — or more formally, lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) — are very much in the process of being developed. LAWS are systems that can select and fire on targets without human help, and prototypes exist in a range of weapons and military vehicles, including drones, submarines, tank turrets, missile-defense systems, and stationary sentry robots. While such systems are not widely deployed yet, many governments are actively developing such technology, so it is crucial to consider its implications and necessary restrictions for it now.</p>

<p>In fact, in 2015 more than 3000 experts signed <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/?cn-reloaded=1">“Autonomous Weapons: an Open Letter from AI &amp; Robotics Researchers”</a>, which warned that “Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is — practically if not legally — feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms.” They specifically warned of the dangers of the uncontrolled spread of LAWS — likening them to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/worlds-deadliest-inventor-mikhail-kalashnikov-and-his-ak-47-126253">Kalaknishkovs</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> of the 21st century. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33686581">Researchers</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17786080/united-nations-un-autonomous-killer-robots-regulation-conference">diplomats</a> have warned that LAWS <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2016-09/features/stopping-%E2%80%98killer-robots%E2%80%99-why-now-time-ban-autonomous-weapons-systems">pose a destabilizing threat</a> to the international order with five core risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lowering the threshold for conflict because fewer lives are at stake;</li>
  <li>carrying out assassinations anonymously and remotely;</li>
  <li>amplifying terrorist attacks; - subduing populations or selectively killing a particular ethnic group; and</li>
  <li>locking competing algorithms into loops of conflict escalation — possibly nuclear conflict — without a person being able to break the cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these warnings, 30 global arms manufacturers <a href="https://qz.com/1746154/lacking-regulation-firms-on-track-to-make-killer-robots-reality/">have been identified</a> by the peace nonprofit Pax <a href="https://www.paxforpeace.nl/media/files/pax-report-slippery-slope.pdf">to be actively developing LAWS</a>.</p>

<p>Few laws exist to constrain the use of killer robots. At the international level, no law or policy deals specifically with LAWS or other automated systems. However, since this technology will be used by the military to kill, certain international rules and rights apply that restrict all weapons of war; like any weapon, these technologies are governed by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/killer-robots-and-the-laws-of-war-1383521594">the laws of war</a> and the use of force, which state that no weapon can be used to kill civilians indiscriminately or without a clear military objective behind the strike. However, experts stress that LAWS may lower the threshold to conflict and cannot be guaranteed to accurately discriminate civilians from soldiers, so the laws of war and use of force rules do not adequately address the threat LAWS pose. A treaty or arms control agreement constraining the use of LAWS, they argue, is necessary.</p>

<p>Despite the growing danger of LAWS being unleashed on the battlefield, diplomats <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-rights-killer-robots/nations-dawdle-on-agreeing-rules-to-control-killer-robots-in-future-wars-idUSKBN1ZG151">are still scrambling</a> at the United Nations (UN) to ban or bring LAWS under an arms control agreement. But, major powers, including the US, China, and Russia, are blocking progress towards a framework of any kind. In this piece, we’ll survey the state of killer robots (or, LAWS), as well as current efforts on their regulatory framework.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-killer-robots">What are “killer robots”?</h2>

<p>In the Terminator movies, John Conner is on a mission to save the world from a terrible future: the US military’s AI system, Skynet, becomes self-aware, starts a global nuclear war, and then builds an army of robotic soldiers to finish killing off mankind. These robot soldiers make their evil intent clear, marching with rifles in hand and radiating malevolence from their red eyes. In real life, however, spotting a “killer robot” is not so simple.</p>

<p>AI’s general-purpose nature may be attractive to the military, but it also makes pinning down what exactly is a killer robot complicated. The common thread pulling them together is lethal autonomy, although the specific weapon is different in each case. But, defining autonomy in LAWS is more complicated than it seems. Drones, for example, display levels of autonomy ranging from none (human piloting it and selecting and firing on targets), partial (flying autonomously but a person selects targets), to total independence from human operators. Plus, the term LAWS can describe a variety of possible weapon systems, from sentry robots and other self-defense systems to offensive ones like drones and wingmen for fighter pilots. As Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence and expert on its military applications, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/21/18691459/killer-robots-lethal-autonomous-weapons-ai-war">explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When people hear ‘killer robots,’ they think Terminator, they think science fiction, they think of something that’s far away […] Instead, it’s simpler technologies that are much nearer, and that are being prototyped as we speak.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While AI and robotics have made rapid progress over the past decade, the technology is still <a href="https://www.ausa.org/articles/changing-way-soldiers-fight-and-survive-ai-battlefield">too limited</a> to replicate everything a human soldier can do. Machine learning algorithms are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/greedy-brittle-opaque-and-shallow-the-downsides-to-deep-learning/">brittle, biased, and vulnerable</a> to both hacks and a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/">more subtle kind</a> of manipulation called <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/8/18297410/ai-tesla-self-driving-cars-adversarial-machine-learning">adversarial attacks</a>. Likewise, robots in the field struggle to move like soldiers do, communicate with them by listening to commands and reading body language, and distinguish between enemy soldiers and civilians. What machines are good at is automating specific tasks a soldier might do. Keeping watch, collecting and analyzing information, monitoring the battlefield, driving a tank or targeting and shooting at people — these are areas where AI is making its impact on war.</p>

<p>Just in the US, for example, nearly every branch of the military is developing LAWS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Army is building a 50-mm turret called <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2019/06/army-to-test-robotic-gun-bruce-jette/">Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System</a> (ATLAS) to put on tanks. ATLAS can autonomously detect targets, determine if they are hostile, and train its cannon on them with superhuman speed and accuracy.</li>
  <li>The Navy has installed an automated version of its Aegis missile system that reacts faster than humans can to shoot down incoming missiles or manned targets. The branch has also <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dsei/2019/09/10/the-us-navy-just-had-a-major-breakthrough-with-autonomous-weapons/">sailed a ship</a> from California to Hawaii and back without human help.</li>
  <li>The Air Force is a pioneer in developing lethal autonomy in drones. It has flown an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/pentagon-artificial-intelligence-terminator.html">autonomous version</a> of the infamous Predator drone that can track and kill targets as well as <a href="https://www.airforcemag.com/article/the-looming-swarm/">shown off swarms</a> of small drones that can communicate with each other and act collectively. Pushing automated lethality to its limits, the Air Force has gone as far as to propose pairing fighter pilots with robot wingmen to fly and fight alongside them. The Predator drone has been at the forefront of the unmanned system revolution in the military; one modern warfare expert Peter Singer has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/11/19/losing-humanity/case-against-killer-robots">described it</a> as “merely the first generation—the equivalent of the Ford Model T or the Wright Brothers’ Flyer.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> In August, foreshadowing an evolution in drones that will take them beyond being the Model T, an AI-powered fighter pilot <a href="http://ford/">beat</a> a human pilot in a series of simulated F-16 dogfights.</li>
  <li>The US is projected <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12713">to spend</a> $17.5 billion on drones between 2017-2021, including 3,447 new unmanned ground, sea, and aerial systems despite already owning 20,000 autonomous vehicles. Each branch is adapting autonomy to fit their needs. In the air, sea, and on land, the development of LAWS is transforming how the US military fights.</li>

<p>While the US is a leader in developing the building blocks of killer robots, it is not alone in its pursuit of LAWS. Global military spending on automated weapon systems and AI, narrowly defined, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12713">is projected</a> to reach $16 and $18 billion respectively by 2025. At the latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/09/killer-robots-pressure-builds-for-ban-as-governments-meet">count</a>, “at least 381 partly autonomous weapon and military robotics systems have been deployed or are under development in 12 states, including China, France, Israel, the UK, and the US. …</p></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>I use <a href="https://goodreads.com/">goodreads</a> a lot because I like to read books and want to find more books to read. This morning I was reading a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24451428">thread on hackernews</a> on <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon">Sarah Manavis’s NewStatesman article</a> and it reminds me of how much I want, I yearn, for useful book recommendations. I think about this pretty much every time I open the goodreads page or app and hope that maybe this is the day they finally fix recommendations, so I figure I would capture some ideas I have for fixing their recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="i-love-goodreads">I Love Goodreads</h2>

<p>First, I love Goodreads. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9499790-brian">profile</a> says I joined May 2012. But I think that’s just whenever I started this profile and I have multiple, old profiles that I can’t find. My memory says I started using them soon after launch, but maybe I’m misremembering. But I’ve used them for a long time because I like to read books. I love browsing bookstores and libraries looking for new books. I experience joy finding a 50 or 100 year old book that I didn’t know about. One of my favorite things is reading a book so good that I can’t go to bed, or want to walk an extra mile. But that’s pretty rare for me, I’m lucky if I get one of those a year.</p>

<p>I have goodreads on my <a href="http://prepend.com/stack.xml">link stack</a> with the tag <a href="https://www.prepend.com/future/technology/2020/01/purdah.html">“purdah”</a> that I think means it is part of the stuff I do that uniquely identifies me.</p>

<p>Any time I get a recommendation from a friend or article or wherever, I add it to my “to read” shelf on goodreads. That helps me when I’m trying to buy a new book. So at least I can read through the 245 books that at least a past me wanted to read. This works well and is better than a vanilla list.</p>

<p>I also like seeing what my friends read and especially what they like or dislike. My friends have different tastes so it’s not as simple as just reading everything they read, but it helps a little. It’s one of the few places that I think facebook helps because at least I get to find out facebook friends who also are on goodreads. Every once in a while I find a new book through this feed, maybe once every 2 years. This might be because I don’t have many friends on goodreads (only 42), but I think it’s also because different people have different tastes in books.</p>

<p>I also like that goodreads will tell me when an author I’ve read releases a new book, or is having a book chat or something. Although I wish they would tell me when they come to a local book signing.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-as-i-see-it">The Problem As I See It</h2>

<p>This gets me to what I think is wrong and want to fix. I have read and rated 802 books with my average rating of 3.97. This makes sense as I’m probably only going to read books I think I’ll like, but I think this is the average goodreads rating, not the average of my ratings. Looking at what I rated, I’ve only given out 3 one stars, 42 two stars and tons of five stars. I keep scrolling on and on.</p>

<p>The user interface for goodreads is pretty bad- information is hard to find, layout is wasted, search doesn’t work well, hard to tell ads from user content- but that’s not what I’m talking about here. The main problem is in finding books that I will like. Maybe a UX overhaul from a great designer would help, but not that much. A craigslist interface would be great if they could just solve this one problem…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the single book that I will love most in all the world?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to find the next amazing experience. Books are great because they are cheap and portable. It’s not like wine where the best is more than I’ll ever pay. Or travel where a first class flight can cost $20k. If I can find a book, I can read it. And maybe someone I know can read it too.</p>

<p>If I can mix in more wonderful books, my life will be better. My family’s life will be better. Etc etc. Maybe this is the answer to world enlightenment. Probably not, but it will be great, I think.</p>

<p>When I click on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/recommendations">recommendations</a>, goodreads shows me five books that I don’t want to read. And it’s weirdly bad. Some of it makes since why it’s bad. They recommend different versions of books I’ve read. They recommend two different versions of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (one of my favorite books), but I guess they don’t know these are the same book. That’s just a waste of time and it’s weird that amazon isn’t smart enough to avoid duplicative books.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/goodreads_recommendations.png" alt="Screenshot of goodreads recommendations page"></p>

<p>But then they recommend stuff like Stephen King’s <em>The Long Walk</em>. This is perplexing because I only have one book that goodreads knows I’ve read from King and I rated it two stars. I don’t have any of his books in my “to read” list. Why would they recommend this book? Two of my friends rated it four stars and one even wrote a recommendation. So maybe that’s why. I’m aware of this book and don’t want to read it. But other books like <em>Shoe Dog</em> by Phil Knight has no relationship to me. Why would they recommend this? I also know about this book and don’t want to read it. I wish there was some way to note books that I don’t want to read. Then at least they would stop showing me the same book over and over.</p>

<p>So it seems like goodreads is making pretty basic, rules-based recommendations. And they don’t help me pick new books.</p>

<h2 id="my-perfect-wish">My Perfect Wish</h2>

<p>My idea for an 11-star experience <sup id="fnref:brian_chesky" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:brian_chesky">1</a></sup> in finding new books is that Goodreads knows me even better than I know myself and constantly recommends the perfect book. They recommend books that teach me, that spark enlightenment, that I hate but teach me to appreciate other books, books for when I want to be happy, and books for when I need to be sad. I want something like Jane from Ender’s Game who experiences everything I know but is fixated on finding me a good book. So the output of a book sommelier whose passion is seeing me sit there and love a book.</p>

<p>That’s what I would like.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-story-about-jeff-bezos">A Little Story About Jeff Bezos</h2>

<p>Once I was lucky enough to go to TED. It was great on so many levels, I highly recommend it and 2/3 of the cost was tax deductible. It was full of great stuff. I got to wait in the registration line in front of Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer, that was neat.</p>

<p>Anyway, one night Neil Gaiman was doing in a midnight ghost story reading in some neat four story townhouse type building <sup id="fnref:vancouver_club" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vancouver_club">2</a></sup> that was totally empty and spooky and a great place for the event. The reading was on the top floor and there was a huge crowd waiting for the single elevator in this place. The lights were off and there weren’t any staff around so it was maybe 100 people waiting to go up three at a time. So I looked around the corner and took the stairs. About 2 or 3 other people had the same idea so we started racing up the stairs to get to the top and avoid the crowds.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/vancouver_club.jpg" alt="Vancouver Club street view">
<em>photo by <a href="https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/2-joe-fox">Joe Fox</a></em></p>

<p>This building was awesome. It seemed 100 years old, rare in Vancouver, and as we went up the stairs we saw each floor. The stairwell opened up to a big room that could probably seat a 50 person wedding dinner. The lights were off, and someone had opened a few windows and the white, wispy curtains were blowing with a little breeze. Even though it didn’t feel like a breeze. I said “cool, haunted house” and stopped climbing the stairs to look around. The person next to me said “yeah, cool” and we started quickly running around checking out the empty room. We did this on the third floor too and me and this random person did quick 60 second explorations of this spooky house.</p>

<p>It all happened quickly. Maybe 3 minutes to go up the stairs, run around each floor, and get to the top. About halfway through I realized this random dude was Jeff Bezos. I thought that was neat. I’ve bought books from Amazon since 1995 and I’m pretty sure I telnetted into it to order some books (although maybe that was cdnow before they bought them), so it was cool to think that Jeff Bezos likes haunted houses and still likes exploring empty buildings.</p>

<p>We got to the top and went into the venue and were maybe the first 10 people. Comically got there maybe after two or three elevators full of people. We went to the front where Gaiman was setting up at the podium. I got a comfy chair right in the front about five feet in front of Gaiman. Jeff Bezos sat in the chair to my left. The chair on my right had Neil’s wife, Amanda Palmer, who was carrying a ukelele case. I didn’t know it was a ukulele case until she told me. She also said she might play, but she didn’t.</p>

<p>Gaiman finished setting up and came up to talk to Bezos. Bezos asked if Gaiman got the books he sent. Gaiman said he did and they were really great and he enjoyed reading them. It seemed like this was the most recent in a series of book shipments.</p>

<p>Aside from nerd joy from getting to witness this small talk of people who interest me, I thought, at the time and many times since,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How cool is it that Neil-freaking Gaiman is still finding new books that are great, and how cool would it be to get book recommendations from Jeff Bezos. I bet he has access to the best book recommendations in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, TED has something called the “TED book club” where they mail you this box of books a month before the conference. This was the closest I’ve come to my dream. They maybe sent 10 and 5 are still on my bookshelf. But not the shelf behind me, so I don’t remember them specifically. I’ll look them up one day.</p>

<p>That’s probably better than Jane making recommendations. Amazon had just bought goodreads a year earlier and I was hopeful that any day, goodreads would roll out a wonderful recommendation engine any day now.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-do-to-fix">What I Want to Do to Fix</h2>

<p>What I would like to do is to just get a data dump of mine and everyone on goodreads recommendations. I don’t need to know the identities, just to know what recommendations go with what individual. It would be neat to protect privacy and find individuals to potentially follow them on goodreads, but I think for the analysis I want to do, I don’t need to know the actual identities.</p>

<p>I think if I have this data, I could try to find people who rate a few hundred books like I have, then look at what books they’ve read the most, or books that they’ve rated highest. I think that would be a good signal that I might like it.</p>

<p>It would also be cool to see …</p></article></div></div>

<p>Let’s say you share an interesting post with your friend. You’re excited to know what they think about it. They say, “I’ll check it out!” but you never hear them talk about it later.</p>



<p>Similarly, in marketing, you email your blog links to your prospects/customers, expecting them to open, click, and read it. And when the open and click rates are incredibly low, you’re upset.</p>



<p>Well, let me break the news to you.</p>



<p>We’re all busy people.</p>



<p>Most of us have not mastered the art of prioritizing and managing our work well. So if your friends or customers don’t engage with your’ knowledge dump’, don’t be upset. Instead, try to help them. We can do this by being mindful of the reader’s time.</p>



<p>So, the next time you email your blog or video links to your customers, share an&nbsp;<strong>excerpt</strong> of the content&nbsp;to sell its&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;along with the&nbsp;<strong>reading time</strong>. </p>



<p>When the reader knows they’ll have to spend x minutes on consuming your content, it signals two things:</p>



<ul><li>they will appreciate the fact that you’re&nbsp;<strong>mindful of their time</strong></li><li>if the&nbsp;<strong>reading time is short</strong>, they’re more<strong>&nbsp;</strong>likely<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to<strong>&nbsp;click</strong>&nbsp;and read it</li></ul>



<p>Also, if what you’ve shared can positively benefit the reader, and you’d like to hear from them, don’t hesitate to follow up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I love the emails that <a href="https://twitter.com/Patticus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick</a> from ProfitWell sent after I downloaded their e-book.</p>

<p><span><span>Broadly speaking, a spiral curve originates at a central point and gets further away (or closer) as it revolves around the point. Spirals abound in nature, being found at all scales from the whorls at our finger-tips to vast rotating spiral galaxies. The seeds in a sunflower are arranged in spiral segments. In the technical world, the grooves of a gramophone record and the coils of a watch balance-spring are spiral in form.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Spiral Equations</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In polar coordinates, the radial distance <i>r</i> ( <i>θ</i> ) from the central point is a monotonic function of the azimuthal angle <i>θ.</i> There are several canonical spiral forms. The simplest is the Archimedean spiral, <i>r = a θ</i>. This is generated by a point moving with uniform speed along a ray that is rotating with constant angular speed. Since the points of intersection with a fixed ray from the origin are evenly spaced with separation 2 <i>π a</i>, it is also called an arithmetic spiral (left panel of figure above). It was described by Archimedes in his work <i>On Spirlas</i>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>More generally, we consider <i>r</i><sup><i>k</i></sup><i> = a</i><sup><i>k</i></sup><i> θ</i>. For <i>k</i> = 2 we get Fermat’s spiral <i>r = a </i><i>√</i><i> θ</i> (centre panel of Fig). For <i>k</i> = –1 we have <i>r = a </i><i>/</i><i> θ</i>, which is a hyperbolic spiral (right panel of Fig).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An equiangular spiral is such that every ray from the origin cuts it at the same angle. Its equation is <i>r = a</i> exp (<i> b</i> <i>θ</i> ). Since <i>b</i> <i>θ</i> = log (<i>r / a</i> ), it is also called a logarithmic spiral and, since the intersection points with a fixed ray form a geometric sequence, the name geometric spiral is also used. Christopher Wren observed that many sea-shells, such at the <em>Nautilus</em>, have logarithmic spiral cross-sections.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Involutes</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Suppose you wish to cut the grass. Here is an easy way:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Erect a stout column in the centre of the lawn;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span>Tie the mower to the column with a long rope;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span>Start it so that it winds inward in a spiral arc;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span>Relax and enjoy the magic of the <i>automower</i>.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>The curve traced by the mower looks like an Archimedean spiral. It is actually slightly different: it is the involute of a circle (namely, the circular cross-section of the central column). The column should be chosen to have circumference 2 <i>π a </i><i>= D </i>where<i> D </i>is the blade diameter of the mower.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the column is described by the equations</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>x = a </i>cos <i>θ</i> ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>y = a</i> sin <i>θ</i> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>where <i>a</i> is the radius of the circle, then the curve traced out by the mower is</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>x = a </i>( cos <i>θ</i> + <i>θ</i> sin <i>θ</i> ) , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>y = a </i>( sin <i>θ</i> – <i>θ </i>cos<i> θ </i>)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The radius vector is <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> ( 1 + <i>θ </i><sup>2</sup> ) . For <i>θ</i> = 0 we have <i>r = a</i>, whereas, for the Archimedean spiral ( <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> <i>θ </i><sup>2</sup> ) we have <i>r</i> = 0 when <i>θ</i> = 0. The two curves are close, but not identical:<br>

            </p><p>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral">
                Line integrals</a> measure the extent to which a path agrees with a vector (directional) field.
                This provides an easy way to implement handwriting/tracing/gesture recognition.
                Although not as accurate as fancy ML methods, it still can recognize a wide
                varation in drawings with good accuracy and is versatile in application.
                However, this would not work for OCR applications as the direction of the strokes is an essential component of recognition.
           </p>

            <p>
                The line integral and total length of the path both contribute
                to the scoring. This allows "5" and "8" to be distinguished.
                The centroid of the path is used for adjusting position.
            </p>


            <p>
                Try drawing a number (1-9) in the box to see if it detects it.
            </p>

            
            <canvas id="main-canvas" width="220" height="220"></canvas>

            

            <p>
                To make a new glyph:
                </p><ul>
                    <li> Clear the Canvas </li>
                    <li> Hold <b>SHIFT</b> and draw the character 5-8 times.
Try to keep the position the same as before. Naturally you will add a little variation.

                    </li><li> Optional: Press smooth a few times, then redraw a few more times. </li>
                    <li> Type in the string your glyph represents and <b>Save</b>.</li>
                </ul>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 01 Sep 2020</p>
<h2 id="vintage-dos-programs"><a href="#vintage-dos-programs">Vintage DOS Programs</a></h2>

<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28
  </li><li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5¼-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!

If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:
</p>

<p>
Here is the Logo source code for the above output:
</p>

<pre><code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="digger-in-dosbox"><a href="#digger-in-dosbox">Digger in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a
computer game for IBM PC developed by Windmill Software in 1983.
</p>

<figure id="digger-welcome-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png" alt="A screenshot of Digger welcome screen with the names and pictures of various game characters with a copyright notice of Windmill Software"></a>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.
</p>

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.
</p>



<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre><code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre><code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    [<a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than …</p></li></ul></div></div>

Our objective of evacuating 72 oil workers who were in Libya and desperately heading for the Algerian border was time critical.Â&nbsp; Gadaffi loyalists were in hot pursuit of them, either to kill them or more probably take them and use them as hostages, so how did it all come about?</p><p>It was late February and I was back at the Embassy in Algiers. I had just returned from Cairo where I was part of the UK consular team evacuating British residents. It was a pretty chaotic couple of weeks but we managed to get everybody out who reached Cairo.</p><p>It was the same in Tunisia a couple of weeks earlier. Again, we managed to get those UK citizens who wished to be evacuated out in a more timely and orderly fashion</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Algiers we were closely monitoring the situation that was developing in Libya. On 27 February, the UK mounted a military mission involving Royal Air Force (RAF) Hercules and Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers that flew into the Libyan desert and managed to evacuate 150 oil workers.</p><p>However, it was well known that a large number of foreign oil workers were still stranded in the south and west of the country.</p><p>The Ambassador immediately contacted London who agreed that we should try to mount an evacuation operation. This one would be a consular led mission as opposed to a military one and we had to move fast.</p><p>The latest intelligence we had on the oil workers was that they were heading for the Libyan town of Ghadames which lies on the Libyan/Algerian border.</p><p>It was decided that I would lead the mission and would be accompanied by Mustapha, one of our Embassy drivers who would act as interpreter, the British Defence Attache (a Colonel) and an armed Royal Military Policeman (RMP), one of the Ambassadorâ€™s close protection team.</p><p>The reason for the military presence would be their ability, using their special communications equipment, to liaise with UK military back in London for intelligence updates. I then visited the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get their approval for the trip and to ask for accompanying security en-route.</p><p>For this mission, we had decided to drive.</p><p>It was a considerable distance, some 1300 Kms from Algiers to our proposed base of operations in the town of In-Amenas through the Atlas mountains and snaking through the northern Sahara desert. In addition, some of the provinces we would traverse were known to have active AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Maghreb) cells.</p><p>The Algerians agreed to provide security escorts for the whole of our trip and they did a wonderful job of looking after us the whole time.</p><div id="gallery-2"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/mydiplomaticlifethetruestories/100_0228_2/#main"><img width="292" height="219" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1442" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1442"> Libya</figcaption></figure><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0038/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1451" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1451"> Route marker in the Sahara</figcaption></figure></div><p>Therefore it was with some trepidation we set off. The security situation and the areas we would have to travel through, even with our escorts was still a matter of concern. The time passed slowly as we drove through the Atlas mountains until finally we emerged from the mountains onto the desert plains.</p><p>By now it was late in the evening and dark as we reached the town of Ouargia where we spent the night.</p><p>The next morning at dawn, we set off for In-Amenas. Our aim was to head for the Sonatrach (the largest oil and gas company in Algeria who had agreed to help us) compound in the town, which would be our base for the duration of the operation.</p><p>Having arrived there and getting settled in, the Colonel contacted London who informed him that the oil workers had reached Ghadames, but the Libyan border guards would not let them cross the border until I had provided them with the official paperwork.</p><p>Further troubling news was that although Ghadames was in a Berber area,which had been actively anti-Gadaffi for years, pro-Gadaffi forces and militia were reported to be heading for the town in some force. So now time was definitely of the essence.</p><p>The next morning we left In-Amenas with our escort heading for the Algerian town of Deb-Deb which was just across the border from Ghadames. We arrived there in good time and while the Colonel established our presence with the local dignitaries.</p><div id="gallery-3"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0029/#main"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1452" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1452"> With escort taking a position fix near Deb-Deb</figcaption></figure><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0032/#main"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1453" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1453"> Luxury overnight accommodation!</figcaption></figure></div><p>I headed for the border post to establish contact with the oil workers.

The spokesman for the group said they would not come across and leave their non-EU colleagues behind.</p><p>So instead of 16 evacuees we now had 72, a major consular headache. Quick decisions needed to be made. I left the border post and met up again with the Colonel and explained the predicament. We both decided that if we had to get 72 out so be it.</p><p>I contacted the Embassy in Algiers and told them of the situation and that I intended to bring all 72 across the border.</p><p>I also agreed with the Colonel that he and Noel would stay overnight in Db-Deb and keep tabs on the oil workers and brief them as to what was happening while I returned with my driver to In-Anemas to try and arrange coaches, accommodation and air transport.</p><p>For the next few, frantic hours was spent sorting out the logistical details in In-Anemas, arranging accommodation with Sonatrach, renting local coaches to convey everyone from Deb-Deb to In-Anemas and contacting London to get the German parent firm to arrange air transport for the party from In-Anemas back to Frankfurt.</p><p>I also spent most of the night redoing the official paperwork to show 72 evacuees instead of 16. To add to the urgency, I also received a call from the Colonel to say that we had to get the oil workers out within the next 24 hours as pro-Gadaffi forces were at that very moment nearing Ghadames. Time was critical.</p><p>So before dawn next morning we set off with my escort plus two coaches for Deb-Deb.</p><p>We arrived at lunchtime and I immediately got to work with the local Libyan and Algerian border officials to get clearance to bring the oil workers across the border.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, paperwork was signed off and permissions were granted from both sides and the guys finally crossed over into Algerian territory.</p><p>I was not prepared to hang about, so everyone was unceremoniously bundled onto the coaches and picking up the Colonel and the RMP we left Debdeb for In-Anemas.</p><p>After spending the night at the Sonatrach compound, the party headed for In-Anemas airport as I had been called from our Embassy in Algiers on reaching In-Amenas to say that the German parent company had chartered a flight for midday the next day.</p><div id="gallery-4"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0019/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-4-1454" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-4-1454"> Oil Workers at In-Amenas airport prior to their flight out to Frankfurt</figcaption></figure></div><p>After the formalities of customs, we all assembled in the departure lounge for a farewell photograph prior to the party boarding their flight to Frankfurt and then finally they were gone.</p><p>So it was with a sense of relief that we set off on the long 1300 Kms return journey back to Algiers.

<p>Vim 8.1 was <a href="https://www.vim.org/vim-8.1-released.php">released</a> in May 2018. The “main new feature” was official support for running a terminal within <code>vim</code>. Along with this came a built-in debugger plugin, <code>termdebug</code>, which provides a visual interface for interacting with <code>gdb</code>. This post walks through an example session using <code>termdebug</code>.</p>





<p> Let’s use <code>termdebug</code> to step through and inspect the following C program that calculates the factorial of a number. I’ll be using Ubuntu 18.04, along with a version of <code>vim</code> installed from the Ubuntu repo—8.0.1453—that includes the relevant feature that was <a href="https://www.vim.org/vim-8.1-released.php">officially released</a> as part of <code>vim</code> 8.1.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>vim</code>, a working version of <code>gdb</code> is required for debugging. For Ubuntu, this can be installed from the Ubuntu repo. For macOS, <code>gdb</code> will have to be <em><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PermissionsDarwin">code signed</a></em>, and I’ve found that <code>gdb</code> versions earlier than 8.3 are problematic (tested on macOS Mojave). I haven’t tested debugging on Windows. Before trying to debug with <code>vim</code>, I suggest verifying that <code>gdb</code> works as expected on your system.</p>



<p>The path and/or name of <code>gdb</code> can be modified by setting the <code>termdebugger</code> variable before invoking the <code>termdebug</code> plugin.</p>



<h3><strong>Loading the <code>termdebug</code> Plugin</strong></h3>



<p>After loading the <code>factorial.c</code> source code, let’s load the plugin.</p>



<pre><code>:packadd termdebug
:Termdebug</code></pre>



<p>The tab will split into three windows, which I’ve rearranged so that the editor window is on the right, as shown below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin_loaded.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin_loaded.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<p>The top-left window is for interacting with <code>gdb</code>. The bottom-left window is for interacting with the program loaded by <code>gdb</code>. The editor window on the right—with the corresponding source code—will show breakpoints and highlight lines when stepping through a program. This window also has clickable buttons at the top for interacting with <code>gdb</code>.</p>



<h3><strong>Loading a Program</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll have to compile the code using the <code>-g</code> flag, which will include debugger information in the compiled program.</p>



<pre><code>:!gcc -g factorial.c -o factorial</code></pre>



<p>We can use the <code>gdb</code> window to load the program. In addition to <code>&lt;c-w&gt;</code> commands and/or mouse clicks, we can use the <code>:Gdb</code> command to jump to the <code>gdb</code> window. The following <code>gdb</code> command will load the program (highlighted in the image that follows).</p>



<pre><code>(gdb) file factorial</code></pre>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/file_loaded.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/file_loaded.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<p>Alternatively, we could have passed <code>factorial</code> as an argument when calling <code>:Termdebug</code> earlier.</p>



<h3><strong>Setting Breakpoints</strong></h3>



<p>Breakpoints can be set in the <code>gdb</code> window using ordinary <code>gdb</code> commands.</p>



<pre><code>(gdb) b factorial
(gdb) b 23</code></pre>



<p>Alternatively, breakpoints can be set by navigating to a line of code in the editor window and entering <code>:Break</code>.</p>



<p>Lines with breakpoints are indicated by <span><strong><code>&gt;&gt;</code></strong></span> in the editor window.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/breakpoints.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/breakpoints.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<p>Breakpoints can be removed with <code>gdb</code> commands <s>or by navigating to the relevant lines and entering </s><code><s>:Delete</s></code>. <strong>Update 2019/05/12 6:45pm ET</strong>: On my version of <code>vim</code>, <code>:Delete</code> is used to remove breakpoints, but this was changed to <code>:Clear</code> in a <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/71137fed4d77e985d49ca32c79f030512767b8ce">commit</a> on March 3, 2018.</p>



<h3><strong>Program Execution</strong></h3>



<p>The <code>:Run</code> command starts the program.</p>



<pre><code>:Run [args]</code></pre>



<p>Or alternatively, a program can be launched by entering the <code>run</code> command directly in the <code>gdb</code> window.</p>



<pre><code>(gdb) run [args]</code></pre>



<p>In either case, <code>[args]</code> should be replaced by the program’s arguments. Let’s use the value <code>6</code> to run the <code>factorial</code> program.</p>



<p>Both <code>:Run</code> and <code>(gdb) run</code> will pause execution at the first breakpoint. An alternative way to launch a program is to use <code>gdb</code>’s <code>start</code> command, which will pause execution at the beginning of the program.</p>



<p>I’ve launched the program using the <code>vim</code> command <code>:Run 6</code>. Execution is paused at the first breakpoint, with the corresponding line highlighted.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/run.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/run.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<h3><strong>Stepping through Code</strong></h3>



<p>There are various ways to step through a program.</p>



<ol><li>Invoking <code>gdb</code> stepping commands directly in the <code>gdb</code> window</li><li>Clicking <em>Step</em>, <em>Next</em>, <em>Finish</em>, <em>Cont</em>, <em>Stop</em>, <em>Eval</em> in the editor window</li><li>Issuing <code>vim</code> commands <code>:Step</code>, <code>:Over</code>, <code>:Finish</code>, <code>:Continue</code>, <code>:Stop</code></li></ol>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/steps.gif"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/steps.gif" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<h3><strong>Program Inspection</strong></h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Three physicists received a $3 million Breakthrough prize for proving there isn’t a fifth power (that we all know of). And it began with a collection of table-top experiments utilizing low-cost tools.</p><p>Eric Adelberger, Jens Gundlach and Blayne Heckel collectively lead the “Eöt-Wash Group,” which is devoted to specific checks of bodily legal guidelines. They take their identify from the early-1900s physicist Loránd Eötvös and the College of Washington, the place they work. These Eöt-Wash researchers acquired their begin within the mid-Nineteen Eighties, utilizing a tool often called a “torsion steadiness” to disprove claims of an undiscovered fifth power in physics. Since then, they’ve used extra elaborate variations of the identical system to check the true energy of <u>gravity</u>, detect the tug of <u>darkish matter</u> within the Milky Approach and seek for theoretical bodily results like further dimensions and “axion wind.”</p><div data-render-type="fte" data-skip="dealsy" data-widget-type="seasonal">
<p>The group’s $3 million prize is certainly one of seven awarded this 12 months within the life sciences, physics and <u>arithmetic</u>. They received “for precision elementary measurements that take a look at our understanding of gravity, probe the character of darkish vitality and set up limits on couplings to darkish matter,” in keeping with Breakthrough.</p>
<p>Every year’s winners are chosen by previous recipients in a secret course of, and every profitable particular person or group receives greater than 3 times as a lot cash as winners of the <u>Nobel Prizes</u>. A gaggle of tech billionaires — Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan, Yuri Milner, Julia Milner, Jack Ma and Pony Ma — provide the funds.</p>
<p><strong>Associated: </strong><u><strong>The 18 largest unsolved mysteries in physics</strong></u></p>
<p>Adelberger, Gundlach and Heckel’s win is outstanding partially as a result of their group has not detected any previously-unseen phenomena, constructed any big experiments, or developed any outstanding new theories. As a substitute, they exactly measured bodily results that scientists already knew about, and so they examined claims made by different researchers with uncommon rigor. A few of their most vital outcomes have falsified scientific theories, moderately than proving them proper.</p>
<p>“That is really not what we’re out for, falsifying,” Gundlach instructed Stay Science. “We really are interested by new physics.”</p>
<p>Adelberger considerably disagreed.</p>
<p>“It is just a little extra difficult than that,” he instructed Stay Science. “Physics proper now’s in a sort of disaster. You have acquired two issues that work extraordinarily effectively: Einstein’s gravity and <u>quantum</u> theories. … Each of them have been examined very rigorously, each of them work splendidly. However they’re utterly inconsistent. So there’s one thing actually large we’re lacking. So it is vital to return and ask ‘How effectively can we perceive the issues that we predict we perceive?'”</p>
<p>That is led the crew to develop torsion balances that measure gravitational results to unheard-of ranges of precision.</p>
<p>A torsion steadiness is an easy system: Weights cling from a fiber such that Earth’s gravity pulls them straight down. If the one different forces appearing on the weights additionally pull straight down, they will not transfer in any respect. But when any forces pull them at even a slight angle, they will rotate, and the fiber will twist. It is potential to measure even very delicate twisting of a torsion steadiness’s fiber and detect terribly tiny results.</p>
<p><strong>Associated: </strong><u><strong>6 bizarre details about gravity</strong></u></p>
<p>The trio constructed their first torsion steadiness within the mid-Nineteen Eighties after listening to a chat by one other physicist, Ephraim Fischbach of Purdue College. Fischbach claimed that the <u>4 elementary forces in physics</u> (<u>gravity</u>, <u>electromagnetism</u> and the <u>weak</u> and <u>robust</u> nuclear forces) had a fifth companion. This fifth power, he argued, was a bit like a faint, short-range gravity, pulling lots collectively at distances of as much as about 650 toes (200 meters).</p>
<p>Largely you would not discover this power, as a result of in house most objects are a lot farther aside than that. And on Earth, this supposed fifth power would nonetheless largely pull you in the identical route as gravity. At any given time, many of the mass close to you might be instantly beneath you.</p>
<p>Fischbach made his argument primarily based largely on knowledge from an early-Twentieth-century torsion steadiness experiment by Eötvös (whose identify would turn out to be a part of the Eöt-Wash Group’s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eötvös was testing Einstein’s equivalence precept, the concept two objects dropped on the similar time would fall towards a supply of gravity on the similar fee regardless of their mass, regardless of how briskly the room they’re in is shifting or the place it’s within the universe. Eötvös, like numerous later experimenters, discovered that Einstein’s equivalence precept was right Adelberger mentioned. However Fischbach, pouring by the info a long time later, thought he’d discovered a touch of one thing else, a signature of this fifth power.</p>
<p>“It was a fairly compelling argument,” Gundlach mentioned.</p>
<p>“And if it have been true, it might have been a giant deal,” Adelberger mentioned.</p>
<p>(Fischbach’s argument had issues, he mentioned, which the trio uncovered even earlier than they ran their very own experiment. Certainly one of them: Eötvös himself was a big man, and his personal gravity might have pulled his older torsion steadiness sideways, simulating a fifth power.)</p>
<p>Different researchers had seen Fischbach’s declare, and a few of them appeared to be detecting a fifth power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is as a result of their experiments weren’t designed effectively sufficient, Adelberger mentioned. “Fischbach stored telling us about all these different researchers who have been getting optimistic outcomes, and he mentioned ‘You are within the minority right here.’ And I mentioned, ‘You do not vote on physics.'”</p>
<p>Earlier experiments concerned a ball floating in water, which is problematic as a result of “a ball floating in water is topic to all types of forces,” Adelberger mentioned.</p>
<p>Folks flew all around the world searching for superb take a look at websites for a fifth power, cliffs subsequent to flat land the place the sideways pull of a short-range fifth power could be most exaggerated. The Eöt-Wash Group thought-about flying to Hawaii earlier than realizing it was extra sensible to simply use a hillside in Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>Associated: </strong><u><strong>The 11 largest unanswered questions on darkish matter</strong></u></p>
<p>“There have been different individuals who have been utilizing torsion balances,” Gundlach mentioned. “However we made a bunch of little improvements that made the torsion steadiness so significantly better.”</p>
<p>One of many largest: Inserting the system on a turntable to cancel out exterior forces appearing on the torsion steadiness. The primary turntable they used was a lazy susan, the kind present in some kitchens and eating rooms.</p>
<p>“I bear in mind everybody was laughing at it,” Gundlach mentioned.</p>
<p>Different physicists thought the wobbling of the turntable would overwhelm the faint results they have been searching. However in the long run, with some refining, it labored.</p>
<p>“We simply did a whole lot of beautiful, intelligent issues and there was little question that this was convincing,” Adelberger mentioned.</p>
<p>There was no fifth power.</p>
<p>Over time, the crew’s torsion balances have turn out to be extra refined, requiring exact engineering. They rely closely on staff within the College of Washington’s machine store —— one of many few left within the nation hooked up to a physics division —— to consistently replace and take a look at their balances earlier than experiments. It is vital to get a torsion steadiness calibrated good, Heckel mentioned, as a result of as soon as an experiment begins it may run for days, months or years. And all that point is wasted if the machining and calibrating is not excellent. Any sudden wobbles or forces past the experiment that do not get cancelled out can spoil a batch of knowledge.</p>
<p>The trio’s methods have been utilized in all types of experiments that require very secure measurement gadgets. Know-how they developed to counteract seismic rumbling now helps maintain the laser beams of gravitational-wave detectors secure — contributing to the Nobel Prize-winning first detection of gravitational waves in 2016 and an entire new subject of astronomy.</p>
<p>Their newer, extra superior torsion balances hunt a lot fainter results than the disproved fifth power. Heckel designed a torsion steadiness that detects the delicate power of electrons whirling circles in a steel disk . It was designed to hunt the delicate stress of “axion wind,” a potential impact of darkish matter passing by Seattle. The steadiness by no means detected the wind, however did put new limits on how darkish matter particles couls look and behave.</p>
<p>The researchers have additionally constructed a torsion steadiness delicate to the gravitational pull of the Milky Approach. As a result of the mass of seen star methods within the Milky Approach is well-known, they have been capable of cancel it out of their experiment. That left simply the impact of the Milky Approach’s darkish matter on the torsion steadiness, which they may instantly measure. Their measurement confirmed no impact of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), a principle that rejects darkish matter and claims that extra difficult theories of gravity clarify its obvious results. (Not like the fifth-force experiment, this outcome did not persuade MOND theorists to surrender their claims, Edelberger mentioned. MOND researchers are a troublesome crowd to steer.)</p>
<p>And utilizing yet one more torsion steadiness they measured the power of gravity to unprecedented precision, canceling out different results to give you an awfully exact quantity for the gravitational fixed —— a quantity that governs equations utilizing gravity.</p>

<p>2020 is a lot. For over six months now, we’ve been changing and adapting to get through this pandemic. We’re wearing masks, keep distance to other people, and figure out the new normal as we go.<br>It’s not just our personal lives where we need to adapt, but also our business world. Suddenly, we can’t go to stores anymore, and in-person services become challenging or impossible. This situation forces many businesses to overthink their strategy.</p>



<p>Basically, from today on, they need to solicit or conduct business online and even reinvent themselves to stay relevant. We’re in the middle of Digital Transformation, and it just became non-optional. Either you accept and go with it or staying in the game will become more challenging than ever.</p>



<p>Because we can’t meet in person as we used to, much interaction happens online via websites, text, and video chat.<br>For companies, this means to step up their game in software development. There’s a lot of new tools and best practices to work through. How do you write clean code, integrate Code Reviews, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Delivery into your workflows?<br>But most importantly, do the internal processes support software development?</p>



<p>Let’s say a company’s strategy was to sell cars in their dealerships before and now wants to move the business online.<br>Building the software development competency in-house is one thing and a high priority. More importantly, however, it is to ensure that internal processes are set up to support a digital-first business model.<br>The process of how they sell a car now is changing completely. Before, there was a Salesperson that helped and walked you through everything. Now, there needs to be a configurator. You also need to keep track of how many cars you have in the lot and possibly deliver them to the customer’s home after the purchase.<br>How do you manage payments and signing paperwork? All of that needs to happen online and quickly.</p>



<p>To meet all these requirements, the software development team needs to focus on delivering software quickly and in high quality.<br>That includes Continuous Integration and Delivery, automated Testing, a well-defined deployment process, and short development cycles.</p>



<p>Since this will be a new system, not just from a technical standpoint but also from customer demand, it might not be easy to predict demand upfront.<br>This circumstance requires a dynamic hosting environment where you can quickly scale up and down as needed.</p>



<p>How quickly can you react to changing market conditions? How does your internal change process look?<br>If a customer requests a new feature or reports a bug, how long does it take you to react to it? Now, a bug fix is a different process than a feature request. Yet, both undergo some decision process beforehand before they get into software development.</p>



<p>If you look at your organization from a bird’s eye view, do you notice any bottlenecks? Ask yourself this: Where would your workflow break if you released unlimited work into the organization? Where’s the bottleneck? Is it software development? Is it QA? Ops? Product? This bottleneck will determine how much work you can get done in a unit of time.</p>



<p>So, it’s not just starting to hire software developers but also remodeling your entire organization to become digital.</p>

<p>The following is a series of commentary/lecture notes designed to provide a conceptual introduction to the study of fluid mechanics. I encourage readers to use them in conjunction with a traditional, more comprehensive text; my presentation is both highly unorthodox and prioritizes conceptual clarity and consistency over detail and numerical examples. A book made from these notes, which includes references &amp; additional reading, can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HfcFLzU1ZFvxrX1MW2ZqI5LYHOcq9nF7/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>If you learn something useful from these notes, please help a junior scientist out and cite them!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> is a fast and modern VPN protocol.</p><p>It is a point-to-point VPN, which means it does not have a client-server architecture, but peers, and does not rely on a PKI, unlike OpenVPN.

On servers, it's rarely useful, but when one of the peer is a mobile client like a laptop or a smartphone, it's a life saver, because the usage of WireGuard is completely transparent.</p><p>I'm used to OpenVPN, I even maintain <a href="https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install">a quite popular script</a>, but WireGuard is better in pretty much all aspects.</p><p><strong>Edit: I made a <a href="https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install">wireguard-install script</a> to automate the installation!</strong></p><p>In this post, I will explain how I use WireGuard on my laptop and phone, which forward all their traffic to the server while having a dual-stack connectivity.</p><p>The setup is pretty simple : we have 2 peers, one server and one client.

It will allow us to make our server and our client communicate.</p><p>On the client, add this :</p><pre><code>[Peer]

AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.1/32,fd42:42:42::1/128</code></pre><p>Thanks to this, all the packets destined to <code>AllowedIPs</code> will be encrypted with <code>PublicKey</code> and sent to <code>Endpoint</code>.</p><p>On the server, it's basically the same, with the client private IP and without the endpoint:</p><pre><code>[Peer]

AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.2/32,fd42:42:42::2/128</code></pre><blockquote>Wait... No endpoint? But wasn't this supposed to be a point-to-point server?</blockquote><p>Yes! But WireGuard supports roaming on both ends, and that's what allows us to have peers on the server without endpoints. As long as the peers (the clients) have the initial endpoint of the server, the server will know where so send the packets back, because the client's endpoints will be built dynamically.</p><p>From the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#built-in-roaming">WireGuard website</a> about built-in roaming:</p><blockquote>The client configuration contains an <em>initial</em> endpoint of its single peer (the server), so that it knows where to send encrypted data before it has received encrypted data. The server configuration doesn't have any initial endpoints of its peers (the clients). This is because the server discovers the endpoint of its peers by examining from where correctly authenticated data originates. If the server itself changes its own endpoint, and sends data to the clients, the clients will discover the new server endpoint and update the configuration just the same. Both client and server send encrypted data to the most recent IP endpoint for which they authentically decrypted data. Thus, there is full IP roaming on both ends.</blockquote><p>I hope that makes sense. Keep in mind that WireGuard does not create a tunnel like OpenVPN does, but each packet is encapsulated right away.</p><p>Now, restart the WireGuard interface on the server and the client. The server does not know how to connect to the client, so the client should sent a packet first.	</p><p>When restarting the interface, here on the client, we can see that WireGuard added a route:</p><pre><code><a href="https://stanislas.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f98a8d9897908a95988ab9949b89">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> ~&gt; wg-quick up wg0

I’d like to talk a bit about goals, their importance, some concepts and techniques for individuals (Team/group goals are a different topic).</p>
<h2 id="performance-vs-developmental-goals">Performance vs. developmental goals</h2>
<p>There are basically two kinds of goals in a work setting - performance goals and developmental, a.k.a. growth goals. The key difference in theory is that performance goals focus on end results while developmental goals are learning &amp; growth oriented. In reality most companies use performance goals in a very narrow way, e.g. to incentivize the sales team. This created a bad rap for performance goals and a shift in terminology.</p>
<p>I am strongly biased <strong>in favor of developmental</strong> goals for software engineers. The reason is that I find that most engineers are highly motivated to grow and are also intrinsically motivated to perform in their roles and are just fine without “the boss” telling them how to perform. In fact, after working with cca. 200 engineers I’m yet to find a single one who doesn’t want to perform well in their job.</p>
<p>Helping your engineers with good growth goals and coaching / mentorship can add a lot of value for them, though. It helps them focus, since there’s always just too many things to learn next, it helps them feel they’re progressing, it helps with the alignment with the company’s expectations of their career - which is ideally what the market wants already - and last but not least it makes them feel they’re at the right company. I find that growth opportunities are just as important to engineers as an exciting product to work on, great colleagues, good company culture and of course, fair compensation. I had engineers leave solely because they felt they’re not growing anymore.</p>
<p>There are some rate situations in which performance goals do make sense. One I can think of is when there’s already a gap between your expectations and the engineer’s performance. Closing that gap might require very narrow, outcome-focused goals, but note that this should only be temporary (until closing the gap or deciding to part ways). An example for a place for performance goals is a PiP (Personal Improvement Plan).</p>
<p>I’d also like to have an argument against ‘by default’ performance goals. Setting performance goals <strong>will</strong> feel like micromanagement and mistrust for your engineers. General expectations should be set by the leveling system you hopefully have in place, your company and team culture and your shared values. If none of these inspire and define good performance, then you have a problem there. Setting individual or team performance goals is a band-aid solution.</p>
<p>Your HR department might try to push you towards setting performance goals for your engineers for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don’t deeply understand each department’s field</li>
<li>They want a uniform process and set of training materials across the company</li>
<li>They want an easy way to decide on promotions and compensation</li>
</ul>
<p>My advice is to be proactive about this, reach out to them and make sure you give context about why you believe performance goals don’t fit your department.</p>
<h2 id="okrs-kpis-and-smart-goals-oh-my">OKRs, KPIs and SMART goals, oh my</h2>
<p>OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are two frameworks and concepts for goal setting</p>
<p>There are a plenty of articles about this topic, some very confusing. There’s also a false dichotomy floating around. No, it’s not an either-or situation.</p>
<h3 id="okrs">OKRs</h3>
<p>The best way to describe this framework is with this ‘formula’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You start out with high level Objectives which might be hard or impossible to measure by themselves then you come up with multiple Key Results. Key Results are like milestones but they don’t align on a linear timeline necessarily. They might or might not build/depend on each other.</p>
<p>Objectives are memorable qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging. An Objective should motivate and challenge the individual.</p>
<p>Key Results are a set of metrics/milestones that measure your progress towards the Objective. By definition the success of each key result needs to be easy do decide. It’s also OK not to achieve all of the key results! There’s usually not a 1-1 mapping between objectives and a set of key results.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example: you want to get better at programming in Go. An idea for an objective would be “I want to get confident at Go programming”. A set of potential Key Results could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a CLI tool for updating our JIRA board</li>
<li>Write a REST API service for X</li>
<li>Convert my old Go project to use go modules</li>
<li>Study and deeply understand the following pieces of the standard library: […]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get a sense. I find this framework really helpful for breaking down vague high level “things I want” to actionable and measurable smaller pieces.</p>
<p>You might have seen company/department level OKRs which probably looked different, the reason for that is those usually have numbers as targets in their key results. Some of them are KPIs!</p>
<h3 id="kpis">KPIs</h3>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a goal setting method! This is just a way to structure measuring things, usually performance, usually on the company/departmental level. E.g. for engineering you could have some of these KPI candidates: number of deployments per day, MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery), Cycle time. On a company level some examples are burn rate, profit margin, NPS (Net Promoter Score).</p>
<p>The most important thing about KPIs is which differentiates them from any other metric/indicator is that they measure the most important aspects of performance. You can have many supporting metrics but KPIs should be few and represent the performance</p>
<p>In a developmental goal scenario KPIs sometimes come in handy, mostly for making sure we focus on the real important things and not some vanity metrics. KPI targets are nice Key Result candidates sometimes. Such an example would be an engineer who wants to improve in code quality identifying e.g. mean pull request back-and-forth cycles as a KPI and then setting a target for it as a Key Result.</p>
<h3 id="smart-goals">SMART goals</h3>
<p>This is another framework that can be combined with others. This talks about how an ideal goal should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific (simple, sensible, significant).</li>
<li>Measurable (meaningful, motivating).</li>
<li>Achievable (agreed, attainable).</li>
<li>Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).</li>
<li>Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).</li>
</ul>
<p>The OKR framework guarantees some of these but this is still good guidance.</p>
<p>Consider the previous example: “I want to get confident at Go programming”. Is this a SMART goal? Well… it’s not specific, it’s vaguely measurable (very subjective), probably Achievable, probably Relevant and not time bound.</p>
<p>You could wrangle a bit with making it a SMART goal but I found that some things (the personal and motivating aspect especially) can get lost in that effort. I grew to prefer OKRs over religiously SMART goals.</p>
<p>Again, this is another aspect to take into account and good guidance in general.</p>
<h2 id="not-clinging-to-goals">Not clinging to goals</h2>
<p>Now we got to the most important discussion about goals.</p>
<p>Your engineers set the most amazing developmental goals, so full of energy, motivation, ready to take on the world - then life happened. Should they feel bad? Should you be disappointed as their manager?</p>
<p>Hell no. Of course it’s not nice when someone constantly ditches their goals but goals reflect an intent AND a life situation. Both can change. People might find out that Go is not their thing after all and jump to Rust instead. Did they fail their goal? Of course not. Hell, COVID might happen and people end up cramped together with flatmates or family, not really feeling energetic enough to keep learning. They might not be doing super well in work/life balance.</p>
<p>I might do a separate posts about the buddhist concept of non-attachment and stoicism to give some more perspective here. The bottom line is that goals in general work best if you don’t cling to them but use them as north stars and proxies.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-support-your-engineers-in-setting-and-achieving-goals">How can you support your engineers in setting and achieving goals?</h2>
<p>First and foremost by being supportive, not demanding (see the previous section).</p>
<p>Depending on the level and experience of the individuals you might need to be more suggestive, using your own past experience to come up with good goal ideas.</p>
<p>Make sure they understand it’s for them and you’re not there to dictate goals, merely to support them.</p>
<p>Understand that you’re not always the best person to help them in reaching their goals! There’s a difference between coaching and mentoring and maybe already coaching is better done by someone else in specific areas. Remember, you’re there to support, not to dictate!

<li>*fixes in Getting Rid of Exceptions snippet 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was introduced to Rust in 2018 and has been enamored since. Rust is a system programming language, much like C++. Unlike C++ though, being relatively new, its language design is more modern and sophisticated. Writing with can feel more like writing TypeScript or Haskell. Not surprising since, despite being a language with a very minimum runtime and no GC, it derives many principles of functional programming such as immutability, type inference, higher-order functions, pattern-matching, etc. Over the course of tinkering things with Rust, I realized that writing Rust code makes me a better coder in other languages. This article will describe how my attempt to push the best in Rust's language design into TypeScript, my main language, without altering the language itself.</p>
<h2>Getting Rid of Exceptions</h2>
<p>The first thing that strikes me the first time I learnt Rust is that there are no straightforward to write exception-like code in Rust. For someone used to exceptions after using many languages like C++, Java, JavaScript and TypeScript, this seems like an incomplete language. But Rust's lack of straightforward exception-like is actually thought out in advance.</p>
<p>Exceptions feel neat the first time you understand it. A thrown exception skips code execution into the <code>catch</code> block. By doing that you can ignore the rest of code in the function. The rest of the code in the function represents positive case, which may seem irrelevant when an error happens. Here's a piece of code:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span> </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Error: foo"</span><span>);
</span><span>  </span><span>}
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>someNumber</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>When <code>baz</code> is called it will throw an uncaught exception. By reading the code you know that <code>foo</code> throws an Error. Debugging this snippet is a piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>Now let's see another snippet. In the snippet below you are importing a function that can throw exception.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>callMe</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"somePackage"</span><span>;

</span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>callMe</span><span>();
}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>);
}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Compared to the first snippet, this one is harder to debug. It seems so because 1.) You don't know that <code>callMe</code> will throw an error or not. 2.) If it throws an exception you will not know what is the type of the exception. The more modular your code is, the harder it is to debug exceptions.</p>
<p>Why is that? If you noticed, in the first snippet, you know which function is throwing what because the <code>throw</code> and the caller are in one file. You don't need to switch files or even scroll that far to see what's wrong. Furthermore, unlike in other language like java, TypeScript exceptions are not typed. Because of that, unlike return values, the compiler could not deduce if a function will throw an exception or not, and that's bad. Combined with the fact that an exception propagates up until they are caught. That means exception can be n-level deep. The deeper it is from, the harder it is to debug it.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with statically-typed language, deferring what's supposed to be done in compile-time to run-time is bad. It hands over problems from the compiler to the user.</p>
<p>There are best practices for writing <code>try/throw/catch</code>, such as developers should throw <code>Error</code> objects instead of nullish values. But pushing everyone to apply best practice is not enough. You cannot assert control toward what is being written in external dependencies. There are not many points introducing law when enforcers are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Only when you have dealt with complex codebase you will understand why <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">we should not use exception for flow control</a>.</p>
<p>So how Rust does this? Rust encourages us to return errors instead of throwing it by providing a data type called <code>Result</code>. It is a tagged union which can either be <code>Ok(IdealData)</code> or <code>Err(NonIdealData)</code>. With this, a function can communicate the situation of a a call to its caller. For example:</p>

    <div data-language="rust">
      <pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span> () {</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"1"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>non_number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>number</span><span>);      </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>non_number</span><span>);  </span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>The function <code>.parse()</code> converts a <code>string</code> into <code>u8</code>. There are scenarios where parsing a <code>string</code> into a <code>u8</code> can result in failure, one is if the parsed string is not a numeric string. Because <code>.parse()</code> has a negative case, it returns <code>Result&lt;u8, _&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In Rust, <code>Err</code> does not jump like exceptions. Regardless the result is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>, the program will simply execute the next line. To handle the error the programmer has to check the return value is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>. Early return is encouraged instead of throw. Rust has the <code>?</code> syntax which help making early returns more concise to write and read.</p>
<p>To adopt this feature to TypeScript, these are the important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Errors are returned instead of thrown</li>
<li>Errors types are known</li>
</ol>
<p>To simulate this behavior I am going to use tagged union too. I found this helpful library, <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">fp-ts</a>. It covers a great deal of functional programming experience by leveraging TypeScript's type system, but I will only use a small portion of it.</p>
<p><code>fp-ts</code> has <code>Either&lt;Left, Right&gt;</code> data type. It is like Rust's <code>Result</code> but more flexible. <code>Either</code> is a tagged union value container. <code>Either</code> is <code>Left</code> or <code>Right</code>, usually <code>Right</code> represents the ideal case and <code>Left</code> represents the non-ideal case but both can be used with any types. Below is the type definition of <code>Either</code>.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"left"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>L</span><span> </span><span>};
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"right"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>What's cool about <code>Either</code> is that TypeScript actually supports deducing tagged union from its tag. For example inside this block <code>if (someEither._tag === "left") { }</code> TypeScript knows that <code>someEither</code> is a <code>Left</code>. If there's a <code>return</code> in that block, TypeScript will deduce that for the rest of the function block, <code>someEither</code> data type is <code>Right</code> and not <code>Either</code> anymore.</p>
<p>Let's make a called <code>tryCatch</code>. It is used to wrap a function into Either. <code>fp-ts</code> actually provides this function, but let's write it so that we know what's under the hood.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>tryCatch</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>onError</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>unknown</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>());
</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>onError</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));
</span><span>  </span><span>}
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>With our newly created <code>tryCatch</code>, creating a URL from string for example can be done like this.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>tryCatch</span><span>(
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>),
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span>()
</span><span>  </span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Calling the function will look like this. The following snippet receives a string called <code>maybeUrl</code>. If <code>maybeUrl</code> is not a valid URL it returns an error. If the URL is not calling "example.com" it returns an error. Otherwise, it returns a promise from the <code>fetch</code> call.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>callThisMaybeUrlIfItIncludesExampleDotCom</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(
</span><span>  </span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>
):</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Promise</span><span>&lt;</span><span>any</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span>(</span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>);
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isLeft</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>left</span><span>;

</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>url</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>right</span><span>;
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>"example.com"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>());

</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>));
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>There's a bit more line of codes here, but it is great that the TypeScript compiler now can deduce the error type and you have more control over the flow. You can even deduce if the variable <code>error</code> is <code>instanceof</code> <code>NotExampleDotComError</code> or <code>InvalidURLError</code> for cases like printing different errors.</p>
<h2>Safe TypeScript</h2>
<p>If you have played an early 2000s FPS games and tried to cheat, usually you will find the <code>noclip</code> command. It makes your avatar fly through walls and grounds. Sometimes, though, you take a shortcut and triggers the wrong script. When that happens, you can't finish your level and must restart to make it work again.</p>
<p>That's how I see Rust's <code>unsafe</code> and TypeScript's <code>any</code>.</p>
<p>These two features solve a similar problem. In Rust's case, it enables developers to temporarily unlock the power of handling raw pointer in case someone needs it. In TypeScript's case, someone might need to escape into the free-typed JavaScript world. And in both, it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure everything is fine before the program goes back to the safe system.</p>
<p>Unsafe to safe Rust is like <code>any</code> type to typed TypeScript. Unlike Rust, TypeScript's type only works until you compile it to JavaScript code. Rust has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rust-by-example/conversion/try_from_try_into.html">TryInto/TryFrom</a> trait to convert raw data into a data type. But in TypeScript's case, if you inject a value that does not match TypeScript's type annotation, TypeScript can't do anything. This comes from TypeScript team's decision to make it only a thin layer on top of JavaScript. They thought it is best if for people to write TypeScript like JavaScript and the compilation result to look almost the same as the source code.</p>
<p>My approach for this would be securing all external hole of my application, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebAPIs, which consist of DOM, deserializable user inputs, fetch API, etc.</li>
<li>External Dependencies which returns <code>any</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When I was trying this approach, I was lucky to find <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">io-ts</a>, created by the same author as <code>fp-ts</code>. This library helps me create a runtime type checker, or "codec" as the library's author calls it. Instead of writing:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>userId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>I wrote the codec for User:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>UserCodec</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>({</span><span> </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>userId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>});
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>TypeOf</span><span>&lt;</span><span>typeof</span><span> </span><span>UserCodec</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Again, this is longer, but this is very useful if we want to secure those holes.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>InvalidTypeError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Fet…</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

<h2>From Vim to Ed</h2>
<p>I switched from Vim to Ed twelve months ago,
and I wanted to report my findings on this
strange downstream adventure I took.</p>

<p>I’d been using Vim since about 1998, and I
hardly got close to mastering it after all those
years. In fact, that was one of the reasons I
thought of trying something like Ed: I was tired
of turning a corner only to find a zillion other
great features Vim offers.</p>

<p>I wanted to use an editor that didn’t have
features that were constantly distracting me
from what’s important: writing code.</p>

<h3>The goods</h3>


<p>Ed had one of the most fantastically steep learning
curves in all my many years of nerding. This ol’
editor was so weird in so many ways, I almost
lost heart right off the bat.</p>

<p>A good deal of the Ed ideas are forgotten
in time.  Nobody uses a line-based editor,
so this was one strange playing field to get
accustomed to.</p>

<p>However, once the learning curve was overcome,
the terseness of what I could do became an asset.</p>

<p>In Vim, there’s a million different ways to
get your cursor to zip all around. One of my
favorites was <code>w</code> where on the line in question,
all in normal mode, I could dart over to my
change in word-step motion.</p>

<p>In Ed, the line in question is right there in
front of you, and all you have is ‘regex’ as
your weapon to swap one thing for another.</p>

<p>You’d be surprised how good one can get via
this sole usage pattern. It’s not all that bad,
and thankfully, some distributions of Ed have
nice little shortcuts to make this all the
less pedantic.</p>

<p>With only a few agilities, Ed limits your usage
to x, y, or z. The result?  You get so darn good
at those.</p>

<p>Another powerful plus for Ed, is its undo/redo
limitation.</p>

<p>Usually, one would think, that after some
hacking, one would want to undo changes that
happened twenty edits ago. In Vim, you’d just
hold down <code>u</code> until it gets to that state. In Ed,
the buffer is limited to one undo. Incredibly,
this limitation has never ruined my day. Because
of my for-knowledge that Ed can’t undo twenty
edits ago, my approach on edits has been
‘Edified,’ and my behavior is in sync with this
one undo world.</p>

<p>I don’t pop open Vim ever, except to run a spell
check on something that isn’t code (like this
blog post, for example). Fascinating to me:
one of the side effects of Ed is my spelling
got a lot better. I’m more careful about what
I type, as the pain to undo or edit things is
quite real. Go figure!</p>

<h3>The bads</h3>


<p>Vim offers so much, it’s hard to
compare Ed to something this feature-rich. So,
I won’t.</p>

<p>Rather, I’ll just jot down some of my Ed-related
gripes.</p>

<p>First, one can scroll forward a page via <code>z</code>
in Ed, but one cannot do the reciprocal. I
was so bummed out on day one regarding this,
and I’m still bummed out 365 days later. What I
find shocking, is that <abbr>UNIX</abbr> <code>mail</code> has <code>z</code> to go
forward a page in header listings, and also <code>-z</code>
to go back a page. If only this was baked into
Ed from the start. My workaround is terrible,
and funny as it may sound, when I’m fatigued,
I sometimes try <code>-z</code> to see if it magically
started working.</p>

<p>Perhaps more of a gripe to the authors of <code>sed</code>
rather than Ed, but I wish there was a 100%
compatibility with ‘regex’ substitution patterns
that are valid in Ed, but in <code>sed</code>. This is
not the case, and it’s a shame. In general,
one has to forget about Ed’s awesome shorthand
tricks to get <code>sed</code> to work. It would be great
if the bounty of Ed vocabulary I’ve built up
just simply worked one-for-one in <code>sed</code>.</p>

<h3>More Ed for me</h3>


<p>One year dedicated to Ed is probably enough time
to arrive at a plateau of know-how where the
limitations will remain as such, and the pains
can’t be overcome with any more learning. That
said, I think I’ve arrived at a comfortable spot
with Ed, and I’m going to stick it out with it!</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

<h2 id="if-they-don-t-give-you-a-seat-at-the-table">If they don’t give you a seat at the table…</h2>

<p>Last July I decided to take a plunge and try to start a technology company. It felt like a idea good time: I felt that I had come to a standstill in my current software engineering role and needed a new challenge. While ‘needing a new challenge’ on its own is not a good enough reason to take the financial and career risk that is trying to create a company, I wanted to see if maybe trying to forge my own opportunities would be better than trying to knock down doors that were closed to me. I suppose in a way, this was me trying to bring my folding chair to the table.</p>

<p>It would have definitely been smarter to stay in the industry for a bit longer, for research shows that inspite of our image that a successful startup founder is a 20-something hacker in his college dorm/parents garage, most of the successful company founders are in their 30s and 40s. Presumably more experience in an industry helps in forming the B2B sales channels that a new company will need to generate cashflow. However, I felt that now, before I had financial commitments or dependents, would be a good idea to try out some of my own ideas and see where they go.</p>

<p>The tech industry is mired in mythology of entrepreneurship. Our industry publications are filled with more and more extravagant stories of venture capital funding, exits, IPOs, betting on which companies will break the unicorn ceiling next. “Startup” is its own culture and startup CEOs have their own fanclubs. If you move in these crowds, you’ll soon learn to speak in the language of series A-D, valuations and the obsession to ‘disrupt everything’. From the beginning, I knew that this would not be the path for me. I have neither the university names nor stints at the Big Four to bolster my chances of ending up in the portfolios of Sand Hill Road VC companies. So it would be bootstrapping from the get-go! For a bit over a year, I’ve developed products based on a few business ideas I’ve had, tested the market and tried to monetize them. Below are some of the lessons that I’ve learnt in one year of being an small tech business.</p>

<h2 id="wear-all-the-technology-hats-all-the-time">Wear all the technology hats all the time</h2>

<p>Most software teams in companies that I have worked for are organized to allow every person on a team to specialise in a particular area or technology. For example, one person in the team specialises in front end technologies, another in UX design, and another in the backend component and perhaps another in QA, testing and perhaps one in security. As a solo developer, you have to wear all those hats at once: design the backend, deploy it onto a cloud provider, do a security analysis and harden the app, write automated tests, code the user interface and think about things such as accessibility, design and user experience.</p>

<p>There are certainly those folks in our industry who are comfortable generalists, able to smoothly sail from optimising an SQL query to implementing a responsive website to writing YAML files for a Kubernetes deployment, but I am most definitely not one of them. My expertise lies in building backend/server-side components for processing data and deploying them onto a cloud provider’s infrastructure (usually in a containerised form to a platform such as AWS’ ECS or Google’s Kubernetes Engine), so doing a deep dive into the world of designing user interfaces that are easy to use was a challenge!</p>

<p>I had to dust off my rusty CSS and Javascript skills and read up a lot on designing user experiences. What made this aspect even more challenging, was that a huge chunk of traffic these days comes from mobile devices and designing a user interaction experiences for smaller screens can be very challenging - in particular, if you want to re-use parts of your existing frontend codebase.</p>

<p>The fun doesn’t stop once you’ve got your MVP. Now, you have to put on your DevOps hat on: think about CI/CD, deployment, monitoring and alerting!</p>

<h2 id="build-it-and-they-won-t-come">Build It and They Won’t Come</h2>

<p>The hardest part is just starting out they said. Build it and they will come they said. Well, build it and they might come is closer to the truth. There are lots of cool technology projects out there that are great fun to code, but don’t have any market demand. So it’s important to test out your idea early and do it often. Find the places where your target audiences hang out online and test out the waters. If you are targeting the B2B market, identify who your customers are going to be: big companies, small and medium sized companies, or startups. Will your customers be other tech companies or companies from other industries? How do the people responsible for technology purchases in those companies discover new products? Is it from conference talks or blogposts? Industry publications? Meetups? Magazines?</p>

<p>Building up traffic for your app can be a slow process and this is especially important for businesses that are planning to use the affiliate model to generate revenue: have a runway and be prepared to try out different strategies to get traffic.</p>

<h2 id="you-might-have-to-pivot-more-than-once">You Might Have to Pivot More than Once</h2>

<p>Be prepared to be disappointed. Even some really cool ideas don’t pan out in the end. Some ideas are just too far out there for a company or a consumer to pay you for it. I started Synbyote with an idea of making an on-demand synthetic data company. The goal was to see if there was a market for synthetic datasets that companies could use to benchmark and test their machine learning software. I knew that something similar was out there in the market already - a website called <a href="https://mockaroo.com/">Mockaroo</a>, with a paid plan and a per row of data pricing model, which I thought very interesting. I decided to try a similar pricing model for synthetic data.</p>

<p>My first mistake was to deep dive into coding without doing any customer interviews or market research. After a month or so of researching technologies and developing an app that allowed users to generate a timeseries dataset with custom anomalies, I started looking for machine learning companies that would be willing to try out synthetic datasets to benchmark their anomaly detection algorithms. I had lots of nice customer interviews with companies in the Ops and Security space, but ultimately this concept was too novel and there was no demand for it.</p>

<p>I then dived deep into the world of cloud based data science environments. I started working with JupyterHub, a component that creates and authenticates single user Jupyter notebook servers. This makes it easy to host server side environments for large groups of people: for research and data science teams and for classrooms. This journey led me to learn more about cloud computing platforms from the three big providers: Google Cloud, Azure and AWS. I deployed JupyterHub on Kubernetes instances on all three and presented my findings at PyData London and PyData Amsterdam.</p>

<p>This time I was wiser. I started doing customer interviews often and early. I talked to teams and companies and Jupyter users at conferences. There was a lot of interest, especially from the academic side. Unfortunately, none of this resulted in immediate cashflows and it proved too expensive to run the demo Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>A few months after my JupyterHub project, I started working on visual colour search engines. I read up on computer vision techniques for identifying sections of images and machine learning algorithms for colour segmentation and started building a colour similarity index of makeup products I might want to try at some point in the future. The culmination of this work (described on my company website synbyote.io) is the colour search engine <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> which helps users discover new lip colour products.</p>

<h2 id="there-will-be-admin-lots-of-it">There will be admin. Lots of it.</h2>

<p>Companies need to file taxes and payroll and register for a whole bunch of things. This will be your responsibility. You will need to maintain the website and pay the web hosting bills, maintain accounts and make sure they are correct and accurate. This will consume a nontrivial amount of time.</p>

<p>Bootstrapping usually means doing contracts to fund further development of your startup. Finding new contracts, contacting recruiting agencies, navigating the resulting paperwork and interviewing for roles will take up a nontrivial amount of time. There will be stressful times when you will get rejected from a contract you thought was surely yours. Things that seem doable with a fulltime permanent job (such as getting a rental apartment in a high-demand city like London) will be harder since you won’t pass the automate ‘fully employed’ checkbox many agencies and landlords require.</p>

<h2 id="learn-marketing-and-sales">Learn marketing and sales</h2>

<p>No matter how much we want the world to love our nascent startup idea, it won’t happen without effort. This is where marketing and sales come in. Yes, if you want to make money off your technology, you will have to do marketing: write that blogpost, attend that conference, speak to your users, find out what they think about your product. If you are working with companies, you will have to do sales: negotiate deals, help your customers integrate your product and so forth. Code, usually, does not sell itself.</p>

<h2 id="would-i-do-it-all-again">Would I do it all again?</h2>

<p>I probably would! I got to explore lots of new avenues, a feel for what it is like to be responsible for a real product with real users, a feel for prioritising ideas (as a solo developer you are extremely limited in time, so you have to strike the right balance between addressing tech debt, doing marketing and sales and implementing new features) and got to feel a sense of accomplishment for creating a product that is very useful for a niche audience!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Traffic filtering is a common technique used to protect networks and hosts from malicious activity. The filtering can be done in the incoming and outgoing flows, better known as ingress and egress filtering. There are many examples of use cases for ingress filtering: mitigating DDoS attacks, avoiding SPAM, blocking access to services for specific geographic regions and so on.</p>
<p>One common application of egress filtering is to prevent applications and users from reaching remote hosts.
These kinds of filters are usually based on a large deny-list of IP address ranges, like <a href="https://www.icann.org/news/blog/reputation-block-lists-protecting-users-everywhere">Reputation Block Lists</a>. The technology used to perform this task has to be able to handle a high number of restricted hosts, up to millions in some cases.</p>
<p>Our friends at SAP asked us to perform a benchmark of the common Linux technologies available for this task. This blog post presents the methodology and results from benchmarking some of the Linux filtering technologies: eBPF, IP sets and iptables.</p>
<p><em>Update 2020-09-14:</em> we have received some great feedback and suggestions about other options to try, including BPF JIT optimization (that we left inadvertently disabled) and inline BPF map lookup. We will take a look at this and update this post as soon as possible - expected at the end of the month.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>We had the following goals going into this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a reproducible benchmark framework that anyone else can download and use.</li>
<li>Evaluate the different mechanisms in the Linux networking stack to filter out a large amount of IP addresses and assess their scalability when the amount of IP ranges to block reaches 1 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>We aim to understand the cost of performing egress filtering based on the destination IP in a large set of IP ranges.</p>
<p>The scenario we consider is composed of a client and a server computer that communicate through an IP network. The egress filtering is performed on the client machine and there is no filtering performed on the server side.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/scenario.svg">
</figure>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>An egress filter has to perform a matching operation to understand if a packet can continue its way or has to be dropped. This operation could be costly if the number of blocked IPs is high. This kind of filter impacts the throughput of IP connections, it consumes extra CPU and increases the latency. We decided to take into consideration these metrics under the following conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughput</li>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>Latency</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-filtering-mechanisms">Linux Filtering Mechanisms</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel provides different mechanisms to filter network packets. In this benchmark we considered the most known ones. iptables is the historical and probably more known filtering utility in Linux. IP sets support high speed matching for sets of specific types, like IP ranges for instance. eBPF is very flexible and customizable. The following section provides more details of how we used those mechanisms in our benchmark.</p>
<h3 id="ebpf">eBPF</h3>
<p>eBPF is a virtual machine built in the Linux kernel. In the networking scope, it allows the user to load programs that are executed each time a packet arrives or is sent out of a networking interface. Those eBPF programs can modify, redirect or drop the packets.</p>
<p>There are different types of networking eBPF programs, CGROUP_SKB for per-cgroup filtering, SCHED_CLS and SCHED_ACT for filtering at the traffic control level, and XDP for filtering at the network interface level.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/ebpf.svg">
</figure>
<p>In our scenario, we want to apply the same filtering regardless of the cgroup of the application generating the traffic. The traffic coming from non-local applications or forwarded traffic should be filtered as well. This makes filtering at the socket level unfit for our scenario. XDP programs can only be attached to the ingress<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> path, removing it from consideration in our tests also. By process of elimination, we only consider eBPF programs attached to the traffic control layer.</p>
<p>Given that we want to keep the tests as simple as possible we decided to implement <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark/blob/master/pkg/filters/bpf/datapath/bpf.c">our own</a>filtering program in eBPF that will be attached to the traffic control layer with a clsact qdisc. The clsact qdisc was introduced in Linux 4.5, it’s a pseudo qdisc that allows to attach eBPF programs in ingress and egress using the <a href="https://qmonnet.github.io/whirl-offload/2020/04/11/tc-bpf-direct-action/">direct-action</a> mode.</p>
<p>Our filter implementation uses an <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b95a5c4db09bc7c253636cb84dc9b12c577fd5a0">LPM map</a> to save the list of IP addresses to block. eBPF implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_prefix_match">LPM</a> algorithm with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">digital tree</a>.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/ebpflookup.svg">
</figure>
<h3 id="iptables">iptables</h3>
<p>We tested the standard iptables implementation by adding DROP rules to the OUTPUT chain in the filter table. The rules we used have the following format</p>
<p><code>-A OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.0/16 -o eth0 -m comment --comment "benchmark" -j DROP</code></p>
<p>While implementing this filter we found that appending each rule independently was too slow and we had to use the <code>iptables-restore</code> utility to do it.</p>
<p>iptables uses a linear search algorithm for rule matching.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/iptableslookup.svg">
</figure>
<h3 id="ip-sets">IP Sets</h3>
<p>We performed the testing also with the <a href="https://ipset.netfilter.org/">IP sets</a> framework. We used an IP set of type <a href="https://ipset.netfilter.org/ipset.man.html#lbAZ"><code>hash:net</code></a> and linked it to iptables by using the following rule:</p>
<p><code>-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -m set --match-set myset dst -m comment --comment benchmark -j DROP</code>.</p>
<p>The IP address to check is hashed and the result of the hash is used as the index in a hash table. Each bucket of the hash table contains an array of networks for that hash. When an IP address is checked against an IP set of type “hash:net”, it is not known what network size will match. The IP set implementation hashes the IP address for all possible network sizes. For instance, if the IP to match is 1.2.3.4, it looks for 1.2.3.4/32, for 1.2.3.4/31 and so on until all the 32 possible network sizes have been tested.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/ipsetslookup.svg">
</figure>
<h2 id="benchmark-set-up">Benchmark Set-up</h2>
<p>We used <code>iperf3</code> to measure the performance of TCP, UDP and the CPU usage. The standard <code>ping</code> utility was used to measure the latency. We tested with 10, 100, 1k, 10k, 100k and 1M rules and each test was run 5 times to get statistical robustness.</p>
<p>We used two bare metal servers - running on <a href="https://www.packet.com/">Packet</a> - as client and server machines. The specifications of such servers are:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">c2.medium.x86
1x AMD EPYC 7401P 24-Core Processor @ 2.0GHz
2x 120GB SSD
2x 480GB SSD
64GB RAM
2x 10Gbps
</code></pre></div><p>The exact versions of the tools we used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.flatcar-linux.org/">Flatcar Container Linux</a> by Kinvolk alpha (<a href="https://www.flatcar-linux.org/releases/#release-2605.0.0">2605.0.0</a>)</li>
<li>Linux kernel 5.4.59</li>
<li>iperf 3.0.7 (in a Docker container with the host network)</li>
<li>iptables v1.6.2</li>
<li>ipset v6.20.1, protocol version: 6</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/k8s-egress-filtering-benchmark">https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark</a> has all the tools and instructions to reproduce these tests.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="test-1---tcp-throughput">Test #1 - TCP Throughput</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/throughput-tcp-linerate.svg">
</figure>
<p>The throughput graph shows that the test is reaching line rate, 10Gbps because we are using a single connection hence only one of the interfaces on the bonding is used in most of the cases. Only iptables with more than 10k rules is not able to handle that performance. From this test we can conclude that iptables doesn’t scale well after 100k, but unfortunately we cannot conclude anything from other tests as network performance is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>In order to stress the CPU more, we performed another test using UDP.</p>
<h3 id="test-2---udp-throughput">Test #2 - UDP Throughput</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/throughput-udp.svg">
</figure>
<p>The goal of this test is to saturate the CPU. We used UDP packets and the <code> -b 10G</code> parameter to try to reach line rate. The graph shows that none of the cases reaches the 10Gbps line rate, it’s good for this test because it means the network is not the bottleneck anymore.</p>
<p>We can see that iptables does not scale well beyond 1k rules and that IP sets are a bit faster than eBPF on the clsact qdisc with a high number of rules.</p>
<h3 id="test-3---cpu-usage">Test #3 - CPU usage</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/cpu.svg">
</figure>
<p>We used <code>iperf</code> with a target bandwidth of 1Gbps (<code>-b 1G</code>) to avoid saturating the CPU and be able to compare the CPU usage with the different filters. We take the CPU usage reported by <code>iperf</code> that includes all the applications running on the host. From the above graph we can see that the CPU usage with iptables increases when using more than 1k rules. The CPU usage with eBPF and IP sets filters stays almost constant showing a bit higher usage in the eBPF case.</p>
<h3 id="test-4---latency">Test #4 - Latency</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/latency.svg">
</figure>
<p>We used the standard Linux ping utility to measure the latency with the <code>-i 0.001</code> and <code>-c 1000</code> parameters, sending 1000 pings at a 1 millisecond interval. The above graph shows that the latency is not affected by the number of rules in the eBPF and IP sets filters, it’s ~27µs in those cases. On the other hand, it increases linearly with the number of rules for the iptables case.</p>
<h3 id="test-5---setup-time">Test #5 - Setup Time</h3>
<p>This test aims to measure the time it takes to install the filtering rules on the system. It doesn’t take into consideration fixed times like loading the eBPF program, creating the IP sets but instead focuses on measuring the time it takes to update the rules themselves and how it changes with the number of rules.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/setup.svg">
</figure>
<p>The above graph shows that the time required to set up the rules in all the filters increases linearly with the number of rules.</p>
<p>With 100.000 IPs, the setup time is still less than one second. For 1 million IPs, the setup time is less than 10 seconds. This shows that in practice, all 3 methods have an acceptable setup time.</p>
<p>The setup time is very dependent on the benchmark implementation rather than being inherent to the filtering method. Each filtering method could be optimised in the benchmark code if it were deemed necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the bpf filter: the benchmark performs one bpf() system call for every IP. From Linux 5.6, it is possible to <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=aa2e93b8e58e18442edfb2427446732415bc215e">perform several updates in a eBPF map with a single bpf() call</a>.</li>
<li>For the iptables and IP sets filters, the benchmark executes external commands and feeds each IP range individually over a pipe. We could avoid that by communicating the list to the kernel using the Netlink protocol directly. There are <a href="https://github.com/vishvananda/netlink/search?q=ipset&amp;type=Issues">some attempts</a> to implement IP Sets support in Golang with the vishvananda/netlink library.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, the reader should be cautious before comparing the setup time of one filter to another. This should not be interpreted as one method being better than another but rather to show expected setup performance and that setup time is unlikely to be a problem for any filtering method.</p>

          <p><span>In my journey learning 9 languages over the years, I tried all sorts of different methods to make my learning more effective. Here are some of the notable approaches, along with why they work (or don't work). It </span> <a href="https://knowledgeartist.org/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-a-language" target="_blank"><span>will be a long learning journey</span></a> <span>, I hope this article will make yours more fun and effective. </span></p> <p><span>Let's jump right in.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Moving to the Target Country</span></h3></p> <p><span>In my experience learning a language, immersion is powerful. Being in a country where your target language is spoken is ideal. Your learning becomes always on, even if you don't realize it. </span></p> <p><span>I moved to Tokyo and worked at an all-Japanese company a few years ago. At the beginning I knew very little Japanese. But with this sink-or-swim approach and the daily immersion, I became comfortable with basic conversations within three months.</span></p> <p><span>Now, it is not always possible to just pack up and move to a different place. Read on for other tips I tested from my own experience. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Language Exchange Meetups</span></h3></p> <p><span>You can only get so good at speaking a language without talking to native speakers. Language exchange groups are a great way to get that conversational practice. In a typical event, you would get paired up/grouped with native speakers of your target language, who are themselves looking to level up on your native tongue. </span></p> <p><span>For half of the time, the group would converse in one language, and then switch to the other language half-way. If you live in a major city, there are usually quite a few of these groups for the common languages. </span> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank"><span>Meetup</span></a> <span> is a great place to look for these events. This is an effective way to practice in your home city, or when you are already in your target country. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Online Language Exchange</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you are unable to attend in-person meetups, online language exchange can be effective as well. Though in-person conversations would always feel more organic, you still get the instant feedback and practice with online language exchange calls. </span></p> <p><span>I have made a few friends along the way, while practicing my German, French, and Japanese. I previously had a pleasant experience using </span> <a href="https://www.italki.com/" target="_blank"><span>iTalki</span></a> <span>, where I could easily find language partners and schedule 1-1 Skype calls with them. It was entirely free. But at the time of writing, it appears they may have removed the free partner option.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Learning Entire Phrases</span></h3></p> <p><span>I found it effective to memorize entire sentences, and pull them out when I need to. There are several benefits to this. When you are communicating in realtime, having phrases already memorized can reduce your stumbling. It can make you appear fluent and keep the conversation flowing. This also makes you feel more comfortable, knowing what to say or how to respond in a given situation.</span></p> <p><span>These familiar phrases serve as important anchors as well, for learning about the structure of the language, and for easily swapping out components to adapt to new situations. For example, after memorizing the phrase "After a few months of travelling, I am happy to finally be able to work with everyone", you can substitute some of the words and use it in a new scenario.</span></p> <p><span>Phrase books can be somewhat useful for this purpose, though it can sound scripted and unnatural. What feels more natural is writing down and remembering the response of native speaker in a real-life situation or in a movie.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Movies/Shows in Your Target Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>Movies and TV shows are a great source of natural-sounding phrases (though overly dramatic sometimes) to add to your knowledge bank. This is great for a number of reasons: </span></p> <p><li><span>You can usually figure out what the movie is about (especially if you first watch it in your native language).</span></li></p> <p><li><span>It is enjoyable, which means you will stick with it</span></li></p> <p><li><span>You get to learn about the culture behind your target language</span> <strong> </strong> <span>as well.</span></li></p> <p><span>And if you are watching it on TV, I find that even the commercials in your target language are interesting. Not only is it good practice, you get a better sense of what kinds of products local people buy and the messaging that appeals to them. With the growing selection of international shows/movies on Netflix, along with audio and/or subtitles, this is a fun and easy way to make progress.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Interviews with Subtitles and Translations</span></h3></p> <p><span>In addition to movies/shows, interviews are the perfect content for getting exposure to natural conversations, where people use casual everyday language. </span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/magauchsein" target="_blank"><span>Easy Languages</span></a> <span> on YouTube is hands down one of my favourite language resources. They interview people on the streets on a different topic each episode, and provide subtitles in the original language + English. Over the years, they have built up an amazing collection of content in many (!) languages.</span></p> <p><span>Here's a taste of their content for German learners: </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hLoatpfE7VM?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Passive Background Looping</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is one of the most effective hacks I developed to maximize my time spent learning a language. As I work, I would put on a familiar track of native speakers talking (much of the time it would be Easy Languages) in the ground. This way, I can get a lot of listening practice without spending much time. By picking content that you are already familiar with, you already know what is being talked about. And the looping gets you more "reps" for each phrase. It also helps you memorize entire phrases that you can use with ease later.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Podcasts </span></h3></p> <p><span>This one can be tricky. I have tried quite a few podcasts and many podcast formats aren't that conducive to learning a foreign language. Either I don't understand what's going on, or there is too much repeating over the often dry content. But for Japanese learners, I highly recommend </span> <a href="https://bilingualnews.libsyn.com/" target="_blank"><span>Bilingual News</span></a> <span> hosted by Michael and Mami. It features the hosts talking about interesting topics in the news, with Michael speaking only English and Mami speaking only Japanese. The conversation always moves forward and remains engaging, and you can usually easily fill in the words you missed from the context. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Ask a Native Speaker "How do I say X?" Wherever Possible</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you have friends (or better yet, roommates) from other countries, you can definitely get some practice in as you hang out. When you are trying to say something, why not learn to say it in your target language too? Anytime is learning time! You'll remember it much better than other methods because the learning takes place in real-life expeirences. I used to worry this may come off as annoying, but in my experience most people are happy to help, and appreciate the ernest effort you make to understand their language/culture. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Changing Your Phone's Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>One easy way to squeeze out an extra bit of language immersion is to simply change your mobile phone to your target language. Doing so should automatically update the language in all your apps as well. Since you likely already know how to navigate through most apps anyway, in most cases you can guess the meaning of new words that you don't yet know. With this, even Facebook notifications become good practice. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Taking classes</span></h3></p> <p><span>I have never been a fan of learning a language in a classroom, having taken Russian, French and Mandarin classs. This one is a bit of a hit or miss. The classroom environment has always felt a bit too artificial for this purpose. Typically, there is also limited practice, limited individual attention (and hence </span> <em>feedback</em> <span>). And the separation between the classroom learning context and the real-life situations makes it hard to apply the knowledge.</span></p> <p><span>That said, there are some amazing teachers out there who excel at teaching and building curriculum. And for some people, the structure of learning in a group guided by a competent instructor is just what they need. For Chinese learners, </span> <a href="https://www.excelmandarin.com/" target="_blank"><span>Excel Mandarin</span></a> <span> is an example of educators who have created an effective learning system for their students. Though not from my personal experience, I have heard nothing but positive reviews about these folks. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Duolingo</span></h3></p> <p><span>There was a time when I would have a long-running practice streak on the popular free app </span> <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank"><span>Duolingo</span></a> <span>. I would use the app daily, and almost completed the curriculum for Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and German. I felt great. I felt engaged. I felt like I was making progress. But that's the dangerous part about apps like these that try to "gamify" the language learning process. it makes you feel productive, even if it may not reflect reality. </span></p> <p><span>It is all too easy to slip into auto-pilot mode, where you just rush to the finish line of each exercise. This is similar to how one would "speed read" a book in an hour and retain nothing from it. The app also trains you to get used to the machine-generated bad pronunciation, which is counter-productive for your listening skills. On the bright side, Duolingo can be helpful for exposure to new words, and adding some structure to your learning, especially if you are not following a curriculum or textbook.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Reading Textbooks</span></h3></p> <p><span>Reading a textbook for the purpose of language learning is perhaps the best way to learn the formal structure of a language. But it is not effective for conversational purposes. Grammar rules are clean, but conversational languages are messy. Similar to the discussion above about taking classes, textbooks tend to give a similar passive understanding of rules, as opposed to the ability to apply that knowledge in real-time. </span></p>  <p><span>The best approach is the one you actually take and follow through with. One that fits your learning objectives and learning style. The more you can align your learning with your intrinsic motivation, the more likely it is that it will stick. </span></p>

<p>After the sudden and miraculous shift to remote work in March – the office fightback has well and truly begun.</p>



<p>Four months ago I wrote that – surprisingly- there was no fightback from technophobe hold-outs barricading themselves into their offices. They simply packed up their laptop and went home with the rest of us. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank">How </a><a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/">premature</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank"> I was</a>. </p>

<p>If you thought that 2020 couldn’t get any crazier – it seems some people really are suggesting that businesses should alter their workplace strategies in order to save…sandwich shops.</p>



<p>OK, I’m exaggerating for effect. But there really has been a hand brake applied to the move to remote/hybrid working , or my favoured term,<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/work-futures/the-future-is-minimum-office-not-zero-office-821928abdba2" target="_blank"> minimum office</a></em> in recent weeks. </p>



<p>An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/27/go-back-work-risk-losing-job-major-drive-launched-get-people/" target="_blank">article in the Daily Telegraph</a>&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that employees who continue to work at home will be more vulnerable to redundancy, with bosses finding it far easier get rid of people they don’t physically see.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/KirstieMAllsopp/status/1290987043829489666?s=20" target="_blank">Kirstie Allsopp</a> led the anti-remote work charge on Twitter, suggesting that if your job can be done from home, it can be done from anywhere in the world. Who would have thought that a couple of months of working in shorts and a T-Shirt has made us more susceptible to being replaced by less expensive folk in India, Myanmar and China? </p>



<p>A debate that is framed around saving sandwich shops and an already dying high street isn’t helpful or progressive. Cynically I might suggest the real subtext here is about propping up commercial property investment portfolios. Realistically though, we won’t see anything like a return to the same number of offices, and although few will shed tears for commercial real estate investors many small businesses will suffer a big hit and go out of business unless they can pivot very rapidly.</p>



<p>Clearly there are two groups emerging, those who are desperate for the pandemic to be viewed as a temporary event before everything returns to ‘normal’ and those embracing the true long term disruption that is occurring.</p>



<p>Thank heavens then for more balanced thinkers like Tom Cheesewright who has an uncanny ability to pan back and take the long view. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tomcheesewright.com/were-still-human/" target="_blank">Writing on his website</a> about the current over-confidence in the possibilities for remote working he says:</p>



<p><em>“There is something different about being there, in person, with all of your senses engaged. It’s what I called a few years ago, ‘<a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/the-unbeatable-bandwidth-of-being-there/">the unbeatable bandwidth of being there</a>‘. What gets transmitted and received through the screen and headset, mediated by a million miles of fibre optic cable, is not the full experience of meeting. Nor does it allow for all the things that happen around those meetings. <a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/aftershocks-and-opportunities/">I’ve talked at length about the need for peer support, the subtler parts of staff training, and the mutual inspiration that happens when you’re sharing a physical space</a>.”</em></p>



<p>I’m a remote working, or at least a minimum office, enthusiast. I’ve written on this site for years about the worst aspects of office life and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2014/07/31/why-the-death-of-the-office-cant-come-too-soon/" target="_blank">the most popular post on here applauds its impending doom</a>.  Six years on though I’d admit it’s a deeply flawed argument. The idea that constant interruptions and back to back meetings were a symptom of being in a corporate building has been well and truly busted by…Microsoft Teams. </p>



<p>In truth the problem with work is not the tools or the physical location, but <a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/01/03/ending-our-obsession-with-leadership/">the obsession with leadership</a> , an undue focus on work about work, an overbearing hierarchy and the lack of true digitisation of the enterprise. Deeper, more complex problems.  </p>



<p>It’s ironic that it has taken a pandemic to reveal what was good about the office. “The things that happen between meetings” that Tom writes about reveal our innate desire for human contact – the need to get <em>our senses fully engaged</em>. Wasteful? Quite often. But we dismiss this at our peril. It may seem logical that workplace chatter stifles productivity, but studies show the opposite to be true. </p>



<p>A narrow focus on efficiency in the workplace and a flawed view of what makes people productive is similarly regressive and likely to drag people back to the old normal. As Stowe Boyd writes the backlash against minimum office is in full flow , as detailed in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-start-to-think-remote-work-isnt-so-great-after-all-11595603397?mod=trending_now_pos1">Companies Start to Think Remote Work Isn’t So Great After All</a>, as executives want to get people back in the office:</p>



<p>“<em>An increasing number of executives now say that remote work, while necessary for safety much of this year, is not their preferred long-term solution once the coronavirus crisis passes.</em></p>



<p><em>“There’s sort of an emerging sense behind the scenes of executives saying, ‘This is not going to be sustainable,’” said Laszlo Bock, chief executive of human-resources startup Humu and the former HR chief at Google. No CEO should be surprised that the early productivity gains companies witnessed as remote work took hold have peaked and leveled off, he adds, because workers left offices in March armed with laptops and a sense of doom</em>.”</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s simply we haven’t yet matched our colleagues roles, and their specific work preferences, within our existing organisational design never mind considered a future state. Working from home (managed and supported appropriately) <strong>can</strong> be more productive than going into the office.</p>

<ol><li>Lockdown helps us focus on the work that really matters. We are spending 12% less time drawn into large meetings and 9% more time interacting with customers and external partners.</li><li>Lockdown helps us take responsibility for our own schedules. We do 50% more activities through personal choice — because we see them as important — and half as many because someone else asked us to.</li><li>During lockdown, we view our work as more worthwhile.&nbsp; We rate the things we do as valuable to our employer&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to ourselves. The number of tasks rated as tiresome drops from 27% to 12%, and the number we could readily offload to others drops from 41% to 27%.</li></ol>



<p>The key phrase here is: <em>managed and supported appropriately</em>. Certainly managers need to reinvent themselves as mentors to this style of working and then – forgive me – get the hell out of the way. </p>



<p>The office as the default way of working is dead. But the office itself isn’t dead. With working from home, what we gain in work-life balance we might lose in innovation and creativity. There are people who could directly challenge that sentence but I suspect they will come from highly mature companies who have fully mastered the remote working learning curve. Many of us are still at the stage of doing what we did in the office , just remotely. The timorous amongst us may use the lack of productivity net gains as a reason to regress rather than push through the ‘pain barrier’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/07/11/nirvana-or-business-as-usual-navigating-the-new-future-of-work/" target="_blank">as Matt Mullenweg describes it.</a> </p>



<p>We can do so much better, for ourselves, our customers and society if we stop being so frightened or so certain of the future. </p>



<p>We are going to have fewer offices and spend more time at home. </p>



<p>Our efforts would be a lot better spent improving the experience and outcomes of both rather than arguing about preserving a status quo whose time has truly run out. </p>



<p><em>The office versus remote work?</em> It’s not a binary choice we need to make. </p>



<p>The best thing you can do in any period of change is to bet on neither black or white. The future will be made up instead of shades of grey where few things are certain and <em>the best you can do to prepare is to be endlessly adaptable</em>. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Growth startups often find themselves lacking senior team members as they scale. The problems that arise from this are plentiful, including things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requiring heroics to fix things</li>
  <li>Penalizing junior team members for failure to meet responsibilities well above their pay grade.</li>
  <li>Building technology that doesn’t scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s some reasons why companies get into this situation.</p>

<h2 id="reason-1-habit">Reason 1: Habit</h2>

<p>When you’re a tiny startup budgets are extremely lean and products don’t have a lot of users. In that environment companies often prioritize breadth of functionality (see what works) and getting that via several (more affordable) junior team members guided by a smaller group of senior team members.</p>

<p>Problems arise if that strategy exists past market fit. The add-a-junior-to-do-more strategy implodes as the team grows too large for the senior staff to manage closely and the technical challenges start to look more daunting.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2-hubris">Reason 2: Hubris</h2>

<p>Sometimes people recognize the problems are getting more difficult but still don’t hire more seniors. This can often be chalked up to hubris - surely I can just direct a bunch of juniors to execute on the genius solutions I come up with for all our problems. The problem here is that you’re not a genius and even if you were that strategy doesn’t scale.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3-fear">Reason 3: Fear</h2>

<p>The flip side of hubris is fear. New senior staff can look like a threat to the power of existing senior staff. You might have to choose between doing what’s right for the company and retaining certain kinds of power. The answer there is simple - it’s better to be part of something great than the owner of something that fails.</p>

<p>A different play on this theme is junior teammates fearing that new senior teammates will take away some of their opportunities. It’s possible, sure. But more often the opportunities they will take over are the ones juniors would have had trouble succeeding in.</p>

<p>In a growing company with reasonably difficult challenges, good seniors will do more to expand the set of opportunities than shrink them. And good senior talent will help juniors via mentorship and guidance.</p>

<h2 id="reason-4-money-issues">Reason 4: Money Issues</h2>

<p>Money issues play out in a couple ways.</p>

<p>First, the cost of senior talent can subconsciously make you concerned about the remaining budget for yourself. I haven’t seen this played out directly and blatantly, but it’s another version of the fear game - assuming compensation is a zero sum game leads to weird incentives.</p>

<p>Second, it’s easy to think 2 juniors are better than one senior. As you read about the myth of the 10x engineer you might find yourself thinking this way. Let’s talk more about how this is a misconception in reason 5…</p>

<h2 id="reason-5-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-for-right-now">Reason 5: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills For Right Now</h2>

<p>As referenced earlier, problems get much harder when you add significant growth to a platform. It’s not uncommon to underestimate the challenges at hand. In reality, even simple products at massive scale need significant senior leadership to ensure they are being built and operated effectively. Trying to replace the leadership of senior talent with a volume of junior talent is a sure-fire way to screw this up.</p>

<h2 id="reason-6-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-in-the-future">Reason 6: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills In the Future</h2>

<p>To make things more difficult, you don’t just have to hire for right now, you have to hire for 2 or more years in the future. The senior talent you hire now must seed the leadership ranks you need in the future. Especially in product and engineering, you can’t just hire everyone you need when you need them. For starters, the job market would laugh at that sort of just-in-time attempt at hiring. But also, these roles require much more detailed understanding of the systems at play, so you need to have people with intimate knowledge developed in advance.</p>

<p>Think of it this way - look at whatever company you’re trying to be like in 5 years. Look at their team. If you don’t start hiring towards something like that team sooner rather than later you’ll never be that company.</p>

<h2 id="reason-7-arguments-about-what-seniors-need">Reason 7: Arguments About What-Seniors-Need</h2>

<p>Another reason people hire too junior is thinking around senior talent needing explicit areas of responsibility that don’t overlap. This is the “one alpha” theory - that senior talent can’t collaborate productively and need their own pack. There might be some nuggets of truth here, but most of it is nonsense. That’s like NASA saying they couldn’t have smart people work together on getting to the moon because these great scientists need their own domains.</p>

<p>Ultimately you have to look at the problems you’re solving. If they are truly challenging they can support a number of seniors. If they aren’t you’ll probably have trouble hiring and retaining more than a few.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of reasons why you might hire too junior as your company grows. Know them and hire intentionally.</p>

September 12, 2020 | https://nikolovlazar.com/how-to-render-your-website | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nikolovlazar.com/how-to-render-your-website">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>
<p>Back in the days, rendering a website was simple. You needed a web server that served HTML files. Those were <strong>static sites</strong>. Then developers started using databases and authentication. To achieve that, they needed to manipulate the HTML file before serving it. That's how <strong>server-side</strong> rendering was born. Let's fast forward until 2010, when Backbone got released. The front-end got richer and more complex. Then the era of <strong>client-side</strong> applications begin. Developers migrated their data and routing logic to the client side. They could, because Google "understood" JavaScript. The servers became slimmer, but the websites became more complex. Yet, recently server-side rendering became a trend again. All thanks to React and its server-side hydration feature.</p>
<h2 id="static-sites">Static sites</h2>
<p>Static sites are the simplest way to render a website. You code your website in HTML/CSS, and serve those files from a web server. This is the simplest way to render your website, but it comes with pros and cons.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599911023781/_11mpV_GL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Static Site Diagram"></p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>Since they're static, you <strong>cannot</strong> have dynamic data. To update the data on your static site, you need to edit your HTML files, and deploy them again.</p>
<p>That also means that your visitors won't be able to "contribute" to the website data. They can't leave comments, or create their own posts, or "like" your content.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>But, since there's no "computation" in static sites, they are the fastest to render. The server serves the HTML file, and the browser starts "drawing" immediately. This gives your website <strong>fast TTFB</strong> (time-to-first-byte) <strong>score</strong>.</p>
<p>Another benefit that static sites have is the ability to host them on CDNs. A CDN (content delivery network) is a network of servers distributed around the world. Meaning, your website will "live" on <strong>many servers at the same time</strong>. Also, CDNs are <strong>cheaper</strong> than dedicated servers!</p>
<p>They're also <strong>more secure</strong>. There is no back-end. That means there's less room for your site to suffer an attack, or your database to get compromised.</p>
<p>So, if you need to create a website that doesn't update the data on a regular basis, static site might be the best for you. Your site will be <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>cheap</strong>, and <strong>more secure</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="client-side-rendering">Client-side rendering</h2>
<p>Client-side apps are like static sites, but they use JavaScript to fetch their data. The server serves an HTML file with JavaScript inside, and the browser starts executing. This method also gives you a <strong>fast TTFB score</strong>, but the <strong>TTI</strong> (time to interactive) is slow, since there's no data right away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599911729267/IA0khVN4z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Client Side Diagram"></p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>The TTI in this case depends on the user's internet speed and the amount of data requests. So, you need to be very careful when to trigger your data requests. But, there's nothing you can do about the user's internet speed.</p>
<p>Also, different browsers have different support for scripts. This means that you need to <strong>invest more into testing</strong> your CSA.</p>
<p>If a user decides to disable JavaScript, your website would be <strong>blank</strong>.</p>
<p>To fetch the data, you will need an API. That's an <strong>extra responsibility</strong>. When building APIs, you also need to think about <strong>security</strong> and <strong>data access</strong>. If you leave your API routes open without authentication, someone can make a mess.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>You have <strong>dynamic data</strong>! You won't need to edit files to update your website. Also, your website can be <strong>interactive</strong>. With dynamic data, you can make forums, social networks, tools, and all kinds of platforms.</p>
<p>You can implement authentication. With that, each user can have a <strong>personalized experience</strong> on your website.</p>
<p>Client-side apps can be <strong>SPAs</strong> (single page applications). That means the routing is completely on the client side, and it's instant! Because users don't have to wait for the server to respond when navigating between your pages.</p>
<h2 id="server-side-rendering">Server-side rendering</h2>
<p>Server-side rendering is an old and mature way of rendering the websites. There are tons of tools to help you achieve SSR. It's like CSR, but the data and routing logic lives on the server. When requesting a page, the server fetches the data and inlines it in the HTML file. That file is then served to the user, and the browser starts rendering right away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599912119788/UgnjWZ4s-.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Server Side Diagram"></p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>The TTFB is <strong>slower</strong>. The browser needs to wait for the server to fetch the data and prepare the HTML for your page.</p>
<p>The server will also be <strong>busier</strong>. It needs to visit the database and prepare the HTML file every time a user navigates between your pages.</p>
<p>When navigating between pages a <strong>full page reload</strong> needs to happen.</p>
<h3 id="pros"><strong>Pros</strong></h3>
<p>SSR websites are <strong>SEO friendly</strong>! The search engines can get and index your data without executing extra scripts. Also, they can get the localized version, so you have better SEO for your supported languages.</p>
<p>The content gets served <strong>faster</strong>. This is because usually the servers have better internet connection than the users. Also, servers are more performant than the users' machine.</p>
<p>The user's machine is <strong>less busy</strong>. The browser only needs to take care of rendering, not data fetching and executing scripts.</p>
<p>The SSR method can also <strong>fix</strong> the issues with social sharing and the OpenGraph system.</p>
<p>You also have <strong>dynamic data</strong>. Every time the user lands on your page, the server fetches and serves the freshest data.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-incremental-static-regeneration">Bonus: Incremental Static Regeneration</h2>
<p>This method gets the static site speed of rendering and the server-side data fetching. This is what <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next JS</a> introduced in <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration">version 9.5</a>. So ISR "builds" the static HTML files on build time, but then it rebuilds them every time there's traffic on the site. The rebuilding happens in the background. That means the users are immediately presented with a static HTML file. If the data changes, the server rebuilds that page and starts serving the new version from there on.</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>The server has <strong>less</strong> load than SSR, but <strong>more</strong> load than CSA or Static. But you <strong>can</strong> configure this. The server rebuilds the page after a user requests it and there's new data. That happens on configurable intervals. You can tell the server to revalidate the page on X seconds. So, if you expect frequent data changes set the revalidation interval to a smaller value. If not, you can set the revalidation interval to be, for example, once per day.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>Well, you have <strong>dynamic data</strong> which gets served in a <strong>static way</strong>. You have <strong>fast TTFB</strong> score, but also <strong>fast TTI</strong>.</p>
<p>Because it's static, you get <strong>great SEO</strong> our of the box.</p>
<p>Next JS has a <strong>fallback mechanism</strong> for dynamic pages. Let's say you have a blog that's using the ISR method. Your posts route would be something like <code>/posts/[post-slug]</code>. When you write a new post and publish it, you will only need to open the URL and Next JS will render that post page static. When you open that post again, it will be served immediately.</p>
<p>There's <strong>no full page reload</strong> when navigating between pages. Next JS prefetches the data for the pages that can be accessed from the current page.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The web development world has seen a significant change, and it will keep changing. In this post we got introduced to 4 methods of rendering websites. We explored the pros and cons and now have a good understanding of them. But, there is no holy grail. If you need to develop a very simple website, SSR or CSA will be an overkill, so you can use Static. If you need to develop a blog platform, or a forum, then SSR or CSA will be your best friend. Before deciding which method to use, write down the things that you need to have. Should your site have great SEO? Or dynamic data is the most important factor? Do you need to serve the website on a CDN? This list will help you choose the most suitable method.</p>

    <p>Author: <a href="https://twitter.com/orange_8361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orange Tsai</a></p><p>This is a cross-post blog from <a href="https://devco.re/" target="_blank">DEVCORE</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://devco.re/blog/2020/09/12/how-I-hacked-Facebook-again-unauthenticated-RCE-on-MobileIron-MDM/" target="_blank">ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆè«‹å�ƒé–±é€™è£¡</a></p>
    <p>Hi, it’s a long time since my last article. This new post is about my research this March, which talks about how I found vulnerabilities on a leading Mobile Device Management product and bypassed several limitations to achieve
        unauthenticated RCE. All the vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor and got fixed in June. After that, we kept monitoring large corporations to track the overall fixing progress and then found that Facebook didn’t keep up
        with the patch for more than 2 weeks, so we dropped a shell on Facebook and reported to their Bug Bounty program!</p>
    <p>This research is also presented at <a href="http://hitcon.org/2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HITCON 2020</a>. You can check the slides <a href="https://hitcon.org/2020/slides/How%20I%20Hacked%20Facebook%20Again!.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
    
    <p>
        As a Red Teamer, we are always looking for new paths to infiltrate the corporate network from outside. Just like
        <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/briefings/schedule/#infiltrating-corporate-intranet-like-nsa---pre-auth-rce-on-leading-ssl-vpns-15545" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our research in Black Hat USA last year</a>, we
        demonstrated how leading SSL VPNs could be hacked and become your Virtual “Public” Network! SSL VPN is trusted to be secure and considered the only way to your private network. But, what if your trusted appliances are insecure?
    </p>
    <p>Based on this scenario, we would like to explore new attack surfaces on enterprise security, and we get interested in MDM, so this is the article for that!</p>
    <h2 id="What-is-MDM">
        <a href="#What-is-MDM" title="What-is-MDM"><i></i></a>What is MDM?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mobile Device Management, also known as MDM, is an asset assessment system that makes the employees’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BYOD</a> more manageable for
        enterprises. It was proposed in 2012 in response to the increasing number of tablets and mobile devices. MDM can guarantee that the devices are running under the corporate policy and in a trusted environment. Enterprise could manage
        assets, install certificates, deploy applications and even lock/wipe devices remotely to prevent data leakage as well.
    </p>
    <p>UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) is a newer term relevant to MDM which has a broader definition for managed devices. Following we use MDM to represent similar products!</p>
    <h2 id="Our-target">
        <a href="#Our-target" title="Our-target"><i></i></a>Our target
    </h2>
    <p>
        MDM, as a centralized system, can manage and control all employees’ devices. It is undoubtedly an ideal asset assessment system for a growing company. Besides, MDM must be reachable publicly to synchronize devices all over the
        world. A centralized and public-exposing appliance, what could be more appealing to hackers?
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we have seen hackers and APT groups abusing MDM these years! Such as phishing victims to make MDM a C&amp;C server of their mobile devices, or even compromising the corporate exposed MDM server to push malicious Trojans
        to all devices. You can read the report <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/malicious-mdm-lets-hide-this-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malicious MDM: Let’s Hide This App</a> by Cisco Talos team and
        <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/mobile-as-attack-vector-using-mdm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">First seen in the wild - Malware uses Corporate MDM as attack vector</a> by CheckPoint CPR team for more details!
    </p>
    <p>
        From previous cases, we know that MDM is a solid target for hackers, and we would like to do research on it. There are several MDM solutions, even famous companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Apple have their own MDM solution. Which
        one should we start with?
    </p>
    <p>We have listed known MDM solutions and scanned corresponding patterns all over the Internet. We found that the most prevalent MDMs are VMware AirWatch and MobileIron!</p>
    <p>
        So, why did we choose MobileIron as our target? According to their official website, more than 20,000 enterprises chose MobileIron as their MDM solution, and most of our customers are using that as well. We also know Facebook has
        exposed the MobileIron server <a href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since 2016</a>. We have analyzed Fortune Global 500 as well,
        and found more than 15% using and exposing their MobileIron server to the public! Due to above reasons, it became our main target!
    </p>
    <h2 id="Where-to-Start">
        <a href="#Where-to-Start" title="Where-to-Start"><i></i></a>Where to Start
    </h2>
    <p>
        From <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13968/Mobileiron.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">past vulnerabilities</a>, we learned there aren’t too many researchers diving into MobileIron. Perhaps the
        attack vector is still unknown. But we suspect the main reason is that the firmware is too hard to obtain. When researching an appliance, turning a pure BlackBox testing into GrayBox, or WhiteBox testing is vital. We spent lots of
        time searching for all kinds of information on the Internet, and ended up with an RPM package. This RPM file is supposed to be the developer’s testing package. The file is just sitting on a listable WebRoot and indexed by Google
        Search.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2002/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"><img data-original-height="1127" data-original-width="2002" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"></a></p><p>Anyway, we got a file to research. The released date of the file is in early 2018. It seems a little bit old but still better than nothing!</p>
    <p><em>P.S. We have informed MobileIron and the sensitive files has been removed now.</em></p>
    <h2 id="Finding-Vulnerabilities">
        <a href="#Finding-Vulnerabilities" title="Finding-Vulnerabilities"><i></i></a>Finding Vulnerabilities
    </h2>
    <p>After a painful time solving the dependency hell, we set the testing package up finally. The component is based on Java and exposed three ports:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>443 - the user enrollment interface</li>
        <li>8443 - the appliance management interface</li>
        <li>9997 - the MobileIron device synchronization protocol (MI Protocol)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All opened ports are TLS-encrypted. Apache is in the front of the web part and proxies all connections to backend, a Tomcat with Spring MVC inside.</p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s2048/2020-09-06_230414.png"><img data-original-height="1152" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s16000/2020-09-06_230414.png"></a></p><p>Due to the Spring MVC, it’s hard to find traditional vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or XSS from a single view. Therefore, examining the logic and architecture is our goal this time!</p>
    <p>
        Talking about the vulnerability, the root cause is straightforward. Tomcat exposed a Web Service that deserializes user input with Hessian format. However, this doesn’t mean we can do everything! The main effort of this article is
        to solve that, so please see the exploitation below.
    </p>
    <p>Although we know the Web Service deserializes the user input, we can not trigger it. The endpoint is located on both:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User enrollment interface - <code>https://mobileiron/mifs/services/</code></li>
        <li>Management interface - <code>https://mobileiron:8443/mics/services/</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We can only touch the deserialization through the management interface because the user interface blocks the Web Service access. It’s a critical hit for us because most enterprises won’t expose their management interface to the
        Internet, and a management-only vulnerability is not useful to us so that we have to try harder. :(
    </p>
    <p>Scrutinizing the architecture, we found Apache blocks our access through Rewrite Rules. It looks good, right?</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services/(.*)$ https://<span>%{SERVER_NAME}</span>:8443/mifs/services/<span>$1</span><span> [R=307,L]</span>
<span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services<span> [F]</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>MobileIron relied on Apache Rewrite Rules to block all the access to Web Service. It’s in the front of a reverse-proxy architecture, and the backend is a Java-based web server.</p>
    <p>Have you recalled something?</p>
    
    <p>
        Yes, the <a href="https://blog.orange.tw/2018/08/how-i-chained-4-bugs-features-into-rce-on-amazon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Parser Logic</a>! It’s the reverse proxy attack surface I
        <a href="https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges#blackbox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proposed in 2015</a>, and presented at

        between the Apache and Tomcat to bypass the ACL control and reaccess the Web Service. BTW, this excellent technique is also applied to the recently

    </h2>
    <p>OK, now we have access to the deserialization wherever it’s on enrollment interface or management interface. Let’s go back to exploitations!</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moritz Bechler</a> has an awesome research which summarized the Hessian deserialization vulnerability on his whitepaper,
        <a href="https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Java Unmarshaller Security</a>. From the
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">marshalsec</a> source code, we learn the Hessian deserialization triggers the <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashcode()</code> while reconstructing a
        <code>HashMap</code>. It could also trigger the <code>toString()</code> through the <code>XString</code>, and the known exploit gadgets so far are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache XBean</li>
        <li>Caucho Resin</li>
        <li>Spring AOP</li>
        <li>ROME EqualsBean/ToStringBean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In our environment, we could only trigger the Spring AOP gadget chain and get a JNDI Injection.</p>
    <table>

    </table>
    <p>
        Once we have a JNDI Injection, the rest parts of exploitations are easy! We can just leverage <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a>’s work,

    <p>
        Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a> introduced this on Black Hat, we could
        say that this technique helps countless security researchers and brings Java deserialization vulnerability into a new era. However, Java finally mitigated the last JNDI/LDAP puzzle in
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u181-relnotes.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">October 2018</a>. After that, all java version higher than 8u181, 7u191, and 6u201 can no longer get code execution through
        JNDI remote URL-Class loading. Therefore, if we exploit the Hessian deserialization on the latest MobileIron, we must face this problem!
    </p>
    <p>
        Java changed the default value of <code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase</code> to <code>False</code> to prevent attackers from downloading remote URL-Class to get code executions. But only this has been prohibited. We can
        still manipulate the JNDI and redirect the Naming Reference to a local Java Class!
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept is a little bit similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return-Oriented Programming</a>, utilizing a local existing Java Class to do further
        exploitations. You can refer to the article <a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Exploiting JNDI Injections in Java</a> by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/artsploit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Stepankin</a> in early 2019 for details. It describes the attack on POST-JNDI exploitations and how to abuse the Tomcat’s <code>BeanFactory</code> to
        populate the <code>ELProcessor</code> gadget to get code execution. Based on this concept, researcher <a href="https://github.com/welk1n" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welkin</a> also provides another <code>ParseClass</code> gadget
        on Groovy. As described in <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/Welk1n/p/11066397.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his (Chinese) article</a>:

        <p><span>I</span>t was in 1752 that Linnaeus gave jellyfish the alternative name â€˜medusaâ€™ from the Greek myth of the same name. The term was well chosen. The bell of a jellyfish is a reminder of the head of the Gorgon sister, with its tentacles, like snakes, substituting for hair. Both the mythical Medusa and her animal counterpart were capable of causing paralysis and even death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the version of the Medusa myth found in Ovidâ€™s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, Medusa, one of three Gorgon sisters, was originally depicted as a great beauty whose attractive powers did not go unnoticed. Her hair was only transformed into serpents by the goddess Athena as a punishment. Medusa had been ravished by the sea god Poseidon in Athenaâ€™s own temple and because the temple had been defiled, Athena gave Medusa the power to change any human who looked upon her into stone. Perseus, the son of Zeus and half-brother of Athena, was asked by Polydectes to secure the head of Medusa. Instead of gazing on the Gorgon sister and risking being petrified, Perseus used the reflection on his shield to guide him while removing Medusaâ€™s head with his sword. From her decapitated torso sprang two children, Pegasus, a flying horse, and Chrysaor, a warrior with a golden sword. The transformative powers of Medusaâ€™s head were retained following its separation from the body and when Perseus laid down the head on the seashore, the escaping blood was said to be the origin of red coral (intriguing, knowing the close relationship that exists between jellyfish and coral).&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Caravaggioâ€™s depiction of Medusa, painted towards the end of the sixteenth century, echoes her destructive yet beautiful power while another painting, initially thought to be by Leonardo da Vinci, was to inspire a famous poem by Shelley:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>â€™Tis the tempestuous loveliness of terror; <br>For from the serpents gleams a brazen glare <br>Kindled by that inextricable error,<br>Which makes a thrilling vapour of the air <br>Become a [ ] and ever-shifting mirror.<br>Of all the beauty and the terror there-
A womanâ€™s countenance, with serpent locks, <br>Gazing in death on heaven from those wet rocks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A more up-to-date version of Medusa is seen in Frank Mooreâ€™s painting <em>To Die For</em>. It features the model Kate Moss, her severed head alive with serpents. It was a painting commissioned by Gianni Versace, who never saw it since he was killed before Moore had completed the work. Moore himself died prematurely of AIDS in 2002, aged 48. The picture featured in an exhibition in New York called <em>Toxic Beauty: The Art of Frank Moor</em>e.<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_805b7becd4587e52023de0fe709ad787.jpg" alt="Medusa_by_Carvaggio"><figcaption><span>A ceremonial shield depicting the severed head of Medusa, painted in the late 16th century by Caravaggio. </span><br><span>Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In her poem â€˜Medusa,â€™ Sylvia Plath successfully combines the mythical creature and the sea animal. Written shortly before her own death, it portrays her mother, with whom she had a difficult relationship, as a destructive monster clinging to her by a â€˜cableâ€™, akin to a jellyfish tentacle, and intent on controlling, indeed paralysing, her. It is as though Plath felt the need to exorcize her mother from her life in order to achieve some emotional distance, as well as to afford her greater freedom to write and compose. Plath could be said to have used the device of the snake-haired Gorgon to describe her own internal image of a monstrous mother. Ironically, her mother shared her first name with that of a common genus of jellyfish, <em>Aurelia</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Freud came to regard Medusaâ€™s head as a symbol of castration. In a short, posthumously published essay, â€˜Das Medusenhauptâ€™, he equates decapitation with being castrated, arguing that when a boy views female genitalia for the first time he suddenly realizes the possession of a penis cannot be taken for granted, leading to a specific anxiety about castration. In the same way, glimpsing the Medusaâ€™s head causes a male observer to be struck dumb, on the one hand fascinated by what he sees and, on the other, paralysed with fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Medusa myth, with its built-in ambiguity (deadly but fascinating), has served to reinforce our own ambivalence towards this sea creature. It may also have created a reluctance on the part of scientists to work with these animals. There is however no doubting that, when seen in its natural environment, the jellyfish displays that other, more positive quality, an ability to hold our attention, indeed to fascinate. This is explored in Marianne Mooreâ€™s poem â€˜A Jelly-fishâ€™, where the creature exerts â€˜a fluctuating charmâ€™.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jellyfish escape as quickly as they appear and while they may be allowed to touch us, they themselves often resist capture. They appear both alluring and elusive. The very nature of their movement contributes to their ethereal beauty, and where better to observe this than in a tropical lagoon? The Raja Ampat islands off West Papua boast several. Others can be found on the Kakaban islands off Borneo. In both places the jellyfish have lost their ability to sting humans, making it possible to appreciate their delicacy and movement in safety. In the Ampat islands, the lagoons are connected to the ocean through underwater channels that limit the entry and exit of seawater. In addition, the water there is stratified into an oxygen-rich surface layer where the jellyfish live and a deeper layer, devoid of oxygen, where they are absent. Two genera of jellyfish, the so-called golden jellyfish, <em>Mastigias</em>, and the moon jellyfish, <em>Aurelia</em>, coexist there. The species of <em>Mastigias</em> found in Ampat has lost the spots on its bell and oral arms and the marine biologist Michael Dawson believes this indicates a new subspecies has evolved there with no appreciable sting, presumably as the result of geographical isolation.</p>
<p>The slow, seemingly directionless pulsation of jellyfish can have a calming effect and lends itself to hospital and general practice waiting rooms, a feature as yet unexploited. Its languid movement calls into question how efficient this is as a means of locomotion. Work done at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts is providing the answer. It seems that jellyfish have a special way of recapturing some of the energy expended on each swimming stroke. When a medusa contracts its bell, it creates two vortex rings. The first is shed in its wake, propelling the animal forwards. The second, during the relaxa- tion phase, rolls under the bell. This second vortex ring spins faster than the first and, as it does so, sucks in water which pushes up against the underside of the bell, giving the jellyfish a second- ary boost. It is a technique that works only at slow speeds and when the body size is small. The conclusion reached by Brad Gemmell and his team at Woods Hole is that a jellyfish expends less energy in travelling a given distance than any other marine animal so far studied. Its efficiency, however, comes at a price, namely low speed and virtually no maneuverability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be wrong, however, to dismiss the humble jellyfish as a primitive automaton, unable to modify its movement and behaviour. By attaching accelerometers to the barrel jellyfish, <em>Rhizostoma pulmo</em>, it has been shown that it is able to orientate its swimming in relation to the direction of the tides. When the tide withdraws from the shore, this particular jellyfish orientates itself so as to swim against the current. When the tide flows towards the shore, it also swims in a consistent direction, either with or against the current, depending on the depth of the water. This appears to be a mechanism for keeping jellyfish together as a swarm and avoiding their becoming stranded on the shore.</p>

<p>The fascination that jellyfish engender in us deepens when we consider recent discoveries about another aspect of their behaviour, one which mirrors our own. In the so-called upside- down jellyfish, <em>Cassiopea</em>, it is possible to witness periods of diminished activity resembling sleep from which the creature is only slowly aroused (reminiscent of our own behaviour when sleep deprived). Like us, this jellyfish becomes â€˜sleepyâ€™ when exposed to the naturally occurring chemical melatonin. Sleep, or at least periods of cyclical inactivity, would appear to have arisen early on in evolution, well in advance of the possession of advanced nervous systems.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Earlier in the book, I stressed how the anatomy and the life cycle of jellyfish proved to be more complex than previously imagined. The behaviour of jellyfish in their natural habitat is proving equally complicated. We know that migrations of jellyfish in a horizontal direction are guided by the position of the sun. The golden jellyfish in Palau, for example, follow the sunâ€™s arc across the sky. Before sunrise, they cluster at the western end of Jellyfish Lake. With the dawn, they swim in an easterly direction towards the light, following the sun until they reach the eastern shore. As the sun continues towards the western horizon, the jellyfish reverse their course and return to the western shore to await the new day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vertical migration also occurs. Using echo sounders in a deep Norwegian fjord, the movements of individual helmet jellyfish,&nbsp; <em>Periphylla</em> <em>periphylla</em>, were monitored. This species of jellyfish segregates itself into assemblages. Each assemblage shows a different preference as far as vertical positioning in the water is concerned. Night-time groups congregate for the purpose of feeding and reproduction while other groups form for brief periods in other situations, only to disperse and then re-group. It has been suggested that this represents a type of social behaviour and …</p></article></div>

<p>TL;DR – this is not nearly good enough in most cases and it’s only small fraction of what you are paid for.</p>



<p>I want this post to be the canonical place to refer people to who say “but it works” because people who explain why this is not OK are tired of repeating the same arguments, me included.</p>



<h2>You are paid for …</h2>



<p>Following is not an exhaustive list but it should give you some perspective which is opposite from the narrow-minded “but it works”.</p>



<p>Typically, your Software Engineering $Job pays you for:</p>



<ol><li>Of course the thing <strong>must work</strong>. But also..</li><li>It should <strong>continue working</strong><ol><li>Gives deprecation warnings? Probably not good.</li><li>Only runs on Node.js v10 LTS which is end of life in less than a year (as of writing)? Think again.</li><li>Got away with invalid XML? Can you be sure that the next version of parser won’t be stricter?</li></ol></li><li>It should be <strong>maintainable</strong> (aka you <em>and other people</em> should find it easy to operate and modify, now and years later)<ol><li>Code quality</li><li>Tests (if you don’t have tests, even your basic claim that something “works” is under suspicion)</li><li>Documentation<ol><li>How to use your sh*t?</li><li>How to set up the development environment?</li><li>Decisions</li><li>Non-obvious code parts</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>It should be <strong>production ready,</strong> not abstract “works” or even worse “works on my machine”<ol><li>Logs</li><li>Metrics</li><li>Tested in dev/qa/whatever-you-call it environment</li><li>Reproducible – tomorrow they make a new environment, “qa42”, in a different AWS account in a different region. Could somebody else deploy your sh*t there without talking to you?</li><li><em>Update 2020-09-13 (from Guy Egozy)</em> – Scalable enough to be used in production.</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>If you claim that you are “done” because “it works”, congratulations, you have a (probably) working prototype. That’s typically small part of a project.</p>

<p>Related term – “Tactical Tornado”, look this up.</p>

<p>12 Sep 2020</p>
<p>
So it's been almost a year since I made the jump from team offense to team
defense.
</p>

<p>
I spent so long in a pure offense focused org that the pivot into thinking
about defensive problems was a bit jarring at first.
</p>

<p>
Not in the least because the economics of bug hunting in offense vs bug
hunting in defense are completely upside down.
</p>

<p>
Offense is goal oriented. You establish what you want to achieve, and audit
accordingly. Tending to your attack surface garden until you've grown all the
ingredients you need to complete your soup of the 0day.
</p>

<p>
On the defense side you're stuck trying to extrapolate from the ghosts of
haxmas past. And while there's certainly heaps of known and novel attack
research out there these days … at the end of the day you are going up
against an attacker who's goals, timelines, and resources are essentially
unknown.
</p>

<p>
And that blind spot still makes all the difference.
</p>

<p>
So we play the mitigation game.
</p>

<p>
Assume the code is borky and plop it in a sandbox, a hypervisor, a chromebook
wrapped in tinfoil running on the neighbors wifi …
</p>

<p>
Shuffle the memory. Make it non-executable. Hell, make it non-readable! Sign
the pointers. Validate the control flows. Cookie all the things. Heap
integrity checks. SMEP/SMAP/SMOP/SMUP …
</p>

<p>
Oh right, the hardware. Assume the hardware is broken. De-optimize. Slow
things down. Duplicate all the things at every privilege level.
</p>

<p>
Prevent the side-effect.
</p>

<p>
Stop the unknown.
</p>

<p>
PULL THE PLUG!
</p>

<p>
Phew.
</p>

<p>
Quite a bit of advanced exploit development happens out in the open now, and
Arxiv is, apparently, the new Phrack.
</p>

<p>
Who woulda thunk it?
</p>

<p>
You can even get a PhD based on offense research these days. And not some
handwavy diatribe that yammers on about polymorphic shellcode detection
either, no, the real thing.
</p>

<p>
Systems engineering teams try to distill the lessons on display into ever
advancing mitigations.
</p>

<p>
Exploit teams accept the challenge.
</p>

<p>
Round and round it goes, and the complexity bar keeps getting raised.
</p>

<p>
If you missed the era where most of this stuff happened out of sheer rage or
curiosity in the dark corners of IRC channels … that sound you hear in the
background is the slightly nervous chuckle of 40-something hackers world wide
as they start to worry about aging out of the game.
</p>

<p>
It's easy to confuse complexity for efficacy, especially when they're equally
headache inducing.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of talk about the importance of establishing exploitability in
some sort of automated way. The idea being that you can only properly
prioritize which bugs to fix through proven exploitability.
</p>

<p>
I go back and forth on this myself.
</p>

<p>
The obvious argument is that yes, if a bug has provable security impact, then
it deserves to be prioritized.
</p>

<p>
I think where it gets tricky is with the idea of exploitability. Exploitability
is a weird term. It sounds like an objective valuation.
</p>

<p>
A true/false.
</p>

<p>
But exploitability is really a function of subjective attacker motivation,
experience, resources, and skill.
</p>

<p>
So, for all intents and purposes, the best you can do is establish
exploitability based on what you, the defender, know about exploitation in
relation to how and where your assets are deployed and under which threat
models you practically operate.
</p>

<p>
Ben Hawkes has some solid thoughts[1] on the subject in terms of "equivalence
classes". Match the conditions in which bug A manifests itself to the known
exploitable conditions of bug B and if there's sufficient overlap then you can
make a reasonable assumption of exploitability.
</p>

<p>
If not, then go pay someone to try and write the exploit and stack the result
of that effort into your hackonomicon.
</p>

<p>
Many moons ago I wrote a whitepaper[2] for Microsoft on the subject when they
first came out with the "exploitability index". I tried to argue along similar
lines then, but I think the main difference anno 2020 is that the quality of
the public body of exploitation knowledge is much higher.
</p>

<p>
Julien Vanegue recently also made some interesting arguments[3] in favor of
exploitability-based triage prioritization and where the state of the
art is currently lacking.
</p>

<p>
All debate aside, his exploitability Venn diagram is much prettier than mine.
</p>

<p>
One of the harder practical problems to tackle in the exploitability realm is
that the problem space starts to explode when you combine platform
configurations with software ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
Every layer of the attack surface vertical introduces a massive growth of
potential exploitability that you now have to reason about.
</p>

<p>
VuSec's recent work[4], which combines their speculative execution
vulnerability research with a more traditional software vulnerability, is a
great example of what happens when someone goes "now kiss!" to security
assumptions based on disjointed threat models.
</p>

<p>
So probably the best you can hope for is some limited interpretation of Ben
and Julien's ideas, and apply it to some specific subset of your code, in some
known and static platform configuration. The more you can limit the threat
model exponents, the more practical automated decision making regarding
exploitability becomes.
</p>

<p>
But, that does not factor in the transubstantiative nature of bugs in terms of
exploit development. Many successful exploits are in fact a combination of
bugs. Independently those bugs might not represent an exploitable
vulnerability, but in concert, they do.
</p>

<p>
Or, even more fun, one bug becomes multiple exploit primitives. Julien touches
on this a bit in his section on the flawed thinking around "Approximate
Exploitability". To truly make informed decisions about exploitability, you
have to enumerate all side-effects, of every bug, in every combination.
</p>

<p>
This makes an exploitability focused triage process much trickier, because now
you need combined bug awareness. The kind of awareness that requires focused
audits to try and find the various pieces to complete the attack puzzle.
</p>

<p>
A more practical approach is probably to evaluate bugs for their viability as
an exploit primitive. Sean Heelan's research[5] in the AEG realm comes to
mind.
</p>

<p>
But even then, it's hard to generalize the problem away from very specific
platform and configuration constraints. You would have to reinvent the same
wheel for almost every platform and software stack out there, each with its
own corpus of exploitability knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us back to the bugonomics of defense vs offense. If I'm an
attacker, I obviously care about exploitability. That's how I get things done.
</p>

<p>
But if I'm a defender, in the developer sense of the word, then I probably
care about general code quality more.
</p>

<p>
Bugs, and bug density, are symptomatic of code quality. The less bugs, the
less potential exploitation primitives … the less potential exploitation
primitives, the less chances of successful exploit chains.
</p>

<p>
Vulnerabilities are just rebranded bugs, after all. Nu pun intended.
</p>

<p>
So, the things we need to do to improve code quality are, by definition, the
same things we need to do reduce vulnerabilities. If that relation holds in
both directions, then perhaps there is more bang for buck in pipeline
strategies that focus on code quality and triage speed as a whole?
</p>

<p>
I do think it's important for developers to understand the ideas behind
exploitation. To have a firm understanding of how input has influence on your
code, and how sometimes that influence can pivot into behavior that benefits
an attacker.
</p>

<p>
But we turned the side-effect into its own thing. Glorified it. Built careers
out of it.
</p>

<p>
So here we are.
</p>

<p>
Knee deep in bugs, trying to convince the world that the ones we understand
the best are the most important ones. Chipping away at them one email
notification at a time … hoping that whoever receives them … agrees.
</p>

<p>
<b>waves hands furiously</b>
</p>

<p>
Love,
</p>

<p>
Bas

<h2 id="pointers-that-free-themselves">Pointers that free themselves</h2>

<p>If you are coming from the C world, you have been managing all your resources manually so far.
You allocate each heap memory block using <code>malloc</code> and need to take care of a call to <code>free</code> in every exit path of the function.
As you have probably observed already, this easily leads to human mistakes:
A forgotten <code>free</code> in just one exit path is enough to cause a severe memory leak.
Freeing a pointer twice or using it after a <code>free</code> happens just as easy and can be the source of very painful bugs.</p>

<p>Being a C API, Win32 is no different in this regard.
It offers you <code>HeapAlloc</code> and <code>HeapFree</code>, which are a bit closer to the operating system than their C library counterparts, but otherwise suffer from the same issues.</p>

<p>Now you may argue that YOU obviously never make such mistakes.
So let’s just talk about the code you import from someone else.
If you see a manual memory allocation there, how can you be sure that the programmer correctly handled all exit paths?
There is no way to ensure that unless you check the entire code yourself.</p>

<p>C++ has been trying to be better at memory management since its infancy.
But it has taken until 2011 for C++ to finally come up with a reliable solution that is also going to work tomorrow: <code>std::unique_ptr</code><br>
This template class is a wrapper around any object that you want to put on the heap.
It allocates memory for the wrapped object in its constructor and frees it in its destructor.
As C++ automatically calls the destructor whenever the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope, you can no longer forget that and the human is taken out of the equation.
This makes <code>std::unique_ptr</code> a so-called <em>smart pointer</em>.</p>

<p>If you have been into C++ for quite a while, you may know <code>std::unique_ptr</code>’s predecessor <code>std::auto_ptr</code>.
This one has been deprecated for good (and entirely removed in newer C++ standards) due to its unclear ownership semantics.
The details don’t matter here, just keep in mind that <code>std::unique_ptr</code> fully owns an object and can’t accidentally lose it.
Unlike <code>std::auto_ptr</code>, you can only transfer ownership of that object by using an explicit <code>std::move</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>std::unique_ptr</code> is only an option for allocating a single object.
It does not work for arrays, because those need to be freed differently (<code>delete[]</code> vs. <code>delete</code>).
While people have often asked for an “auto_array_ptr”, modern C++ offers something even better, which we will dive into in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="universal-c-containers">Universal C++ containers</h2>

<p>For a long time, C <code>char</code> arrays and C++ <code>std::string</code> have been two different worlds.
You could get a constant representation of a <code>char</code> array from an <code>std::string</code> using the <code>c_str</code> method, but a true two-way interaction between both types wasn’t possible.
As a result, legacy C interfaces like the Win32 API often limited you to using traditional C-style arrays without the benefits of modern C++ containers.
You had fun managing all the memory allocations yourself, making sure that nothing leaks, and doing <code>strlen</code> over and over again because a <code>char</code> array doesn’t know its size.</p>

<p>This has changed for good starting with C++11, which guarantees that an <code>std::string</code> is internally stored as a <code>char</code> array.
C++17 adds a <code>data</code> method returning a writable pointer to that <code>char</code> array, finally making <code>std::string</code>s universally usable in all places that use <code>char</code> arrays.</p>

<p>Extensive and error-prone code like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> szTest <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>;
<span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, szTest, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, NULL, <span>0</span>);

<span>const</span> WCHAR<span>*</span> wszTest <span>=</span> HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), <span>0</span>, cch <span>*</span> <span>sizeof</span>(WCHAR));
<span>if</span> (<span>!</span>wszTest)
{
    printf(<span>"Out of memory!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
}

MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, szTest, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, wszTest, cch);

<span>// Do something with wszTest
</span><span>// Take care to clean it up in all exit paths using:
</span><span></span>
HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), <span>0</span>, wszTest);</code></pre></div>
<p>can finally become as simple as</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">std<span>::</span>string strTest <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>;
<span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, strTest, strTest.size(), <span>nullptr</span>, <span>0</span>);

std<span>::</span>wstring wstrTest;
wstrTest.resize(cch);
MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, strTest, strTest.size(), wstrTest.data(), cch);

<span>// Do something with wstrTest, cleanup happens automatically
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By the way, the same is also true for <code>std::vector</code>.
All your manual allocations of arrays, prone to buffer overflows and memory leaks, can finally be replaced by automatically managed <code>std::vector</code>s and still interact with APIs written in C.</p>

<h2 id="string-resources-without-regrets">String resources without regrets</h2>

<p>Let’s get deeper into Win32 specifics and use what we just learned.<br>
If you are writing applications for Windows, you have probably made good use of <em>resources</em> already.
Resources allow you to organize strings and graphics at a central location separated from your code.
Each resource is associated with a language code.
When running your application, Windows will pick the resource that best matches your operating system language setting.</p>

<p>For loading a Unicode string resource, the Win32 API of choice is the <code>LoadStringW</code> function.
Even if Microsoft sample code still does, you don’t want to use the ANSI counterpart <code>LoadStringA</code> and neither the <code>LoadString</code> macro that forwards to one of both.
Both were last needed in the era of Windows 95/98/Me, which didn’t come with native Unicode support.
The NT line of Windows has always supported Unicode from the kernel up to the applications.
All <code>A</code> functions there are implemented to convert the string to Unicode and then call the corresponding <code>W</code> function.
As we’re not targeting anything older than Windows XP here, we can (and should!) safely forget about <code>A</code> functions.
Some newer Windows APIs don’t even provide them anymore.</p>

<p>I have seen most people using <code>LoadStringW</code> by declaring a buffer that is “hopefully large enough” and letting the function copy the string into that buffer.
Even Microsoft sample code usually looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">WCHAR wszString[<span>100</span>];
LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_STRING_ID, wszString, <span>sizeof</span>(wszString) <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span>(WCHAR));
</code></pre></div>
<p>This code is potentially dangerous in multiple dimensions:<br>
1. If the string for a language later turns out to be longer than 99 characters (consider the terminating NUL), it is silently truncated.
In the best case, this only impacts your user experience badly.
In the worst case, the user loses critical information because the string is later fed to a formatting function like <code>printf</code> and now misses a format character.
2. The developer may forget to divide by the size of a <code>WCHAR</code> in the last parameter, thereby creating the illusion of a larger buffer and laying the foundation for a typical buffer overflow.
3. The return value of <code>LoadStringW</code> isn’t checked at all, hence <code>wszString</code> may be uninitialized.
If you later work with that buffer, expect things to go tremendously wrong.</p>

<p>Only few people know about the other (scarcely documented) way of using <code>LoadStringW</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++"><span>const</span> WCHAR<span>*</span> pString;
<span>int</span> CharacterCount <span>=</span> LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_STRING_ID, <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span>LPWSTR<span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>pString), <span>0</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of copying the resource string into a buffer, this call provides you with a read-only pointer to it.
All resources are already loaded into memory when starting your application, so retrieving the string this way performs no additional copying.
However, there is a caveat here:
The string is not necessarily NUL-terminated when being loaded this way.
This makes it hard to use the string directly in a pure C world where NUL-terminated strings are expected everywhere.
While we also get the character count from this <code>LoadStringW</code> call, we cannot just insert the missing NUL terminator ourselves due to the read-only nature of the string pointer.</p>

<p>Fortunately, C++ comes to the rescue here.
As we have learned that its <code>std::</code> classes are full-fledged alternatives to C-style character arrays these days, we can use them to fix our trouble with <code>LoadStringW</code>.
Enough said, the final function looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">std<span>::</span>wstring LoadStringAsWstr(HINSTANCE hInstance, UINT uID)
{
    PCWSTR pws;
    <span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> LoadStringW(hInstance, uID, <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span>LPWSTR<span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>pws), <span>0</span>);
    <span>return</span> std<span>::</span>wstring(pws, cch);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>These 3 lines are sufficient to solve all of our problems above.
It doesn’t matter if the string is 10 or 1000 characters long, the function will transparently handle this.
It also doesn’t care about any terminating NUL character, because it just initializes a new <code>std::wstring</code> and copies the retrieved number of characters from the read-only resource pointer.
The returned <code>std::wstring</code> is guaranteed to be initialized and a comfortable and safe way to work with the loaded string.</p>

<p>I’m also using Hungarian notation in my final function to emphasize a few things.
The <code>pws</code> abbreviation refers to a <em>pointer to a wide-string</em>.
You may have more commonly seen <code>pwsz</code>, which would translate to a <em>pointer to a wide-string terminated by zero</em>.
As we just discussed, the latter part does not apply here, and this is underlined by the subtle difference in naming.
Similarly, <code>cch</code> stands for <em>count of characters</em> and distinguishes the integer variable from a count of bytes (<code>cb</code>).
You will deal with both when using Win32 API, and proper naming helps to not mess things up.</p>

<h2 id="mastering-the-handle-mess">Mastering the handle mess</h2>

<p>If you write your Win32 application in C, you soon have handles all over the place.
Every I/O operation, network connection or registry key, just to name a few, is identified by a handle variable that you must take care of.
When a resource is no longer needed, you need to close the handle manually - and again you must do so for all exit paths of your function.
This technique is susceptible to the same human mistakes that we …</p></div></div></div>

<p name="db86">I watched “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" data-href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</a>”, the documentary by the Center for Humane Technology and featuring Tristan Harris, yesterday. It taught me zero new things. I learned nothing that I had not already come across during my research for my latest book <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Life Beyond the Touch Screen</a>. Or that I had not even incorporated in the book.</p>
<p name="b017">I was, however, very much inspired by the documentary.</p>
<p name="b017"><em><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaaC57tcci0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></em></p>
<p name="b017"><em>[Oh wait, I did learn two new things. I learned about </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>the role Facebook played</em></a><em> and admitted it played in the Myanmar Rohingya Muslim violence. And that there is such a thing as </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/23/faking-it-how-selfie-dysmorphia-is-driving-people-to-seek-surgery" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/23/faking-it-how-selfie-dysmorphia-is-driving-people-to-seek-surgery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Snapchat Dismorphia</em></a><em> — a.k.a. kids seeking surgery to look more like their filtered selfies in real life. ‘Da hell.]</em></p>
<p name="b017"><em>[Note: Tristan Harris, together with Nir Eyal and Yuval Noah Harari, has been one of my greatest inspirations for creating "Life Beyond the Touch Screen". Nothing but respect. Read on to understand more.]</em></p>
<p name="a2d9">I was inspired because I recognized two things. One being the difficulty Tristan Harris — legendary former design ethicist at Google — and other former and current high-ranking executives from silicon valley, venture capitalists and academics were having;</p>
<blockquote name="fe84"><em>In trying to explain what was so wrong and so dangerous about the role digital technology is taking in our lives today.</em></blockquote>
<p name="b0e2">What is that problem?</p>
<p name="13db">This was the second thing I recognized. The problem is that next to and simultaneous to adding so much ease and benefit to our lives, digital technology and mainly social media, are impacting our individual mental health, the mental health of our children, and the fabric of society and democracy in very, very dark ways as well.</p>
<p name="b43a">We are getting burn-out by the masses, staggeringly high rates of depression, anxiety and suicide in teens (mostly girls), and unprecedented levels of political polarization and tampering of election results with the help of an explosion of fake news. Propaganda, and real-life, deadly violence.</p>
<p name="5883">Why? Because armies of already genius experts in the psychology of persuasion and addiction, armed with the most powerful technology mankind has ever seen, are becoming more and more proficient at altering our behavior in minuscule but very, very real ways.</p>
<blockquote name="42dd">I am seriously afraid for our mental health, for that of our children, and for the world they will inherit.</blockquote>
<p name="d360">The problem underneath that being that the supercomputers and algorithms working to do that, are programmed from a capitalist and commercial perspective — so their highest goal is not humanity’s greater good: instead it is the highest possible profit.</p>
<p name="81e5">Our attention, time, and energy are being sold to the highest bidder. And as I have written before; maybe it’s <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-state-of-ai-in-the-world-56be75b51887" data-href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-state-of-ai-in-the-world-56be75b51887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a question of when A.I. starts taking over from us humans</a> — but rather a question of when we will wake up to the fact that it already has.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p name="e837">I was so inspired by “The Social Dilemma” that I created the above ArtfulGraphic, to try and help create momentum — in all honesty, also to possibly ride the hype I’m hopefully helping to create, and promote <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my book</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="1241">I drew a lady with a <em>black mirror</em> face, edited the picture in a wonderful app called Photofox, and then created the Graphic in PowerPoint — I’m no pro designer, sorry, not sorry.</p>
<p name="e1a1">Mainly, though, I created the above ArtfulGraphic to try to explain as simply as possible what’s going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="0971">Why this stuff matters and why you want to get inspired and take action now. And why you should watch “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" data-href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</a>” on Netflix today, preferably together with your spouse and your kids, if you have them.</p>

It works like this:</p><ul><li>Whenever I get 10 new sponsors (at u$d 14/m), I start developing the most up-voted feature from a special <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp/projects/2">"Sponsorware" list</a> (which I'm completing as I'm writing this milestone)</li><li>Once implemented, the new feature becomes available to all the sponsors, via a private GitHub repo</li><li>As soon as I get 50 new sponsors, the new feature becomes open source, accessible to everyone via the public GitHub repo, and is integrated into the plugin</li></ul><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/sponsorware-features.png" alt="Sponsorware features" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1120"><figcaption>Sponsorware features</figcaption></figure><p>In a few months, I will also start creating instructional videos, explaining how to make the most out of the plugin. According to Caleb, this is the biggest money-making strategy.</p><p>I have also decided to add a middle tier (at u$d 70/m), where I provide Slack-based personal support, to help users of my plugin set-up GraphQL with WordPress, troubleshooting, and answering their questions. A user needed help to develop a functionality, so he decided to sponsor me &lt;= my first sponsor ❤️</p><p>Finally, I added a higher tier (at u$d 700) for corporate sponsors. I plan to ask around in the WordPress community if their companies may be interested in participating. That would be a win-win: They get plenty of face from contributing to open source, and I get the certainty that I can make a living wage from my work and can focus on the development of the plugin (and not on marketing, which is not my forte).</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/leoloso-github-sponsor-projects.png" alt="My sponsors and sponsored projects" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1210"><figcaption>My sponsors and sponsored projects</figcaption></figure><p>I hope the sponsorware model works, and I can make a living while working on open source.

Analysing pageviews, sessions and visitors only lags context about the engagement of a website visitor.</p> <p>This is solved by collecting additional data from custom events that capture user interactions, such as link clicks for example.</p><p>Events represent user interactions or occurrences.<br>Usually, the most important interactions stand in relation to the goal of the website.<br> Hence, we set up custom event tracking to use it as a performance indicator to see, if our goals are being achieved.</p><p>Events can be grouped into <strong>hard conversions</strong> and <strong>soft conversions</strong> to account for their relation with the overall goal of the website.</p><p>Since events often are the basis to monitor conversions in an ecommerce or remarketing context, it is sometimes referred to as conversion tracking.<br>I distinguish between conversion tracking and tracking an event, since a conversion could also be a pageview or a <b>passive</b> occurence, as for example spending a certain amount of time on a landing page.</p><p>To illustrate what event tracking means, I will show you how to set up <strong>click tracking</strong> on a submit button. Afterwards, you should be able to set up your own unique click events on any element you like - so let's get started!</p><h2 id="what-is-event-tracking-in-google-analytics"><a href="#what-is-event-tracking-in-google-analytics" aria-label="What is event tracking in Google Analytics?" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>What is event tracking in Google Analytics?</h2><p>An event can either be an <strong>active user interaction</strong> or a <strong>passive occurrence</strong>. Tracking them means to watch or count the occurrences and set them in relation to users, visits and other dimensions for later analysis.</p><p>Since you are free to configure events the way you want, they can take many different forms.</p><h3 id="examples"><a href="#examples" aria-label="Examples" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Examples</h3><ul><li>add a product to a shopping basket</li><li>signup to an email list</li><li>scroll down to the bottom of an article</li><li>click play in a video</li><li>user login</li><li>click on an image to zoom</li><li>submission of a contact form</li><li>outbound link click</li><li>print an article</li><li>download a file</li></ul><p>As you can see, events are usually tied to something the user <em>does</em>, based on monitoring...</p><ul><li>mouse clicks</li><li>mouse movements</li><li>scrolling</li><li>browser navigation</li><li>keyboard inputs</li></ul><p>Events can also be <em>passive</em>, without the user doing anything actively.<br>For example, when the user spends a certain <strong>amount of time on a page</strong> or when a form returns an <strong>error</strong>. Also when a <strong>chatbot window</strong> opens up to talk to the visitor, there is no activity coming from the user.</p><p>Though a <b>page view</b> is technically also an interaction, the most widely used Universal Google Analytics counts a page view not as an event. However, the new Google Analytics App + Web (currently in Beta) uses a different data model which tracks page visits as events too.</p><h2 id="event-types"><a href="#event-types" aria-label="Event types" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Event types</h2><p>We can distinguish between two types of events:</p><h6 id="active-events-"><a href="#active-events-" aria-label="Active events (with user interaction)" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Active events (with user interaction)</h6><ul><li>mouse clicks, scroll tracking and mouse movement</li><li>screen touch</li><li>keyboard inputs</li></ul><h6 id="passive-events"><a href="#passive-events" aria-label="Passive events" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Passive events</h6><ul><li>hitting a predefined time threshold</li><li>Server responses</li><li>Programmatic validations</li><li>Third-party script execution</li></ul><p>Note that with tracking active and passive events, you can re-construct a big part of the<!-- --> <!-- -->customer journey<!-- -->. <br>Such data enables you to draw conclusions about the user's experience from beginning to end. If you find any flaws in the journey, you can now take action to reduce those negative experiences.</p><h2 id="structure-of-google-analytics-events"><a href="#structure-of-google-analytics-events" aria-label="Structure of Google Analytics Events" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Structure of Google Analytics Events</h2><p>Each event in Google Analytics holds some event fields, or bits of information about the event, that we can use to describe the occurrence:</p><ul><li><strong>event category</strong> - to categorize events in groups. In the context of a contact form, for example, you would want to group all events into an event category <em>contact form</em></li><li><strong>event action</strong> - to describe the interaction, e.g. <em>form submission</em></li><li><strong>event label</strong> - to add additional information about the interaction. For example, if the user is sending the <em>address of their website</em> along with the form, you use it to distinguish between the received forms</li><li><strong>event value</strong> - (<em>optional</em>) to add a numeric value to the information. For instance, if on avg. every 25th contact leads to a 100$ conversion, we could assign a value of <em>4</em> <!-- -->to each event.</li><li><strong>event non-interaction</strong> - to distinguish between an active or passive user interaction.<!-- --> <br>By default, it is set to <code>false</code>, which means the event counts as active.<!-- --> <strong>Important:</strong> Active events affect the calculation of a page's <b>bounce rate</b>, by lowering it. So if you ever struggle with an unrealisticly low bounce rate, chances are some events user-interaction is set to <code>true</code> by mistake.</li></ul><h2 id="implement-google-analytics-event-tracking"><a href="#implement-google-analytics-event-tracking" aria-label="Implement Google Analytics event tracking" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Implement Google Analytics event tracking</h2><p>There are two possible ways to implement custom event tracking:</p><ol><li><strong>Implement it</strong> with javascript snippets on all relevant HTML elements along with an onclick event handler - <strong>I don’t recommend this</strong> approach, since it is error-prone and not scalable. If you want to do this anyway, you can find code examples in<!-- --> <strong>Google’s event tracking documentation</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events" target="_blank">analytics.js event documentation (legacy)</a></li><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/events" target="_blank">gtag.js event documentation</a></li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong>Setting it up with Google Tag Manager</strong> or another <a href="https://bluerivermountains.com/en/tag-management">tag management system</a> of your choice. <br>Ease and flexibility when implementing changes, as well as scalability and easy integration with third-party services make it the preferred implementation method.</li></ol><p>I will explain how to track events with Google Tag Manager, since it is the most widely used tag management system everyone can get access to.</p><h2 id="guide-to-track-events-with-google-tag-manager"><a href="#guide-to-track-events-with-google-tag-manager" aria-label="Guide to track events with Google Tag Manager" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Guide to track events with Google Tag Manager</h2><p>Setting up custom event tracking can be broken down into creating a <strong>trigger</strong> for the event, as well as creating an <strong>event tag</strong>, which populates the event properties (<em>category, action, label</em>, etc.). <br>The values for the event properties can either be assigned statically or dynamically - where the latter is preferred for scaling the configuration over larger sites.</p><p>As an example, we are going to implement Google Analytics tracking for a button click.<!-- --> <strong>Click tracking</strong> is the most commonly used form of user behaviour tracking, so the example should be applicable to many other use cases.</p><p>At this point I assume that you already created a tracking ID and that the tracking code was implemented across the whole site when you <a href="https://bluerivermountains.com/en/google-analytics-setup">set up Google Analytics</a> with GTM.</p><h3 id="configure-the-event-trigger-in-google-tag-manager"><a href="#configure-the-event-trigger-in-google-tag-manager" aria-label="Configure the event trigger in Google Tag Manager" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Configure the event trigger in Google Tag Manager</h3><ul><li>First, we have to log into our <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager container</a> <!-- -->and <strong>create a new trigger</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li>Give your trigger a <strong>name</strong>, for example <strong>Click - Button</strong>, and click on the<!-- --> <strong>trigger configuration</strong> field to select a trigger type. You will see a list of trigger types slide in from the right.</li><li>Choose <strong>All Elements</strong> as the type and select, that the<!-- --> <strong>trigger only fires on some clicks</strong>.</li><li>Then, in the first dropdown, choose <strong>Click Element</strong>. If it's not listed, just click<!-- --> <strong>Choose built in variable…</strong> and activate it.</li></ul><ul><li>In the second dropdown, choose <strong>matches CSS selector</strong>.<br>Now let me explain what we’re doing:<br>We are trying to generate a click trigger for a specific HTML element on your website - the one you want to be tracking clicks on. In my example, it is a <strong>button</strong>, but it could also be an<!-- --> <strong>image</strong> or a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, or any other HTML tag - so the question is: How do we tell Google Tag Manager (GTM) which element to observe?<br>The Answer is: <strong>CSS selectors</strong> - You don’t know what that is? It is just a programmatic way of specifying HTML elements on the page and I will show you a way to get the CSS selector for any element with just a few mouse clicks.</li><li>In Google's Chrome browser, <strong>right-click</strong> any element you would like to track clicks on and select <strong>inspect</strong>. Chrome Developer Tools will open up and by default, the HTML element will be pre-selected.</li><li>Then you simply <strong>right-click</strong> the element and choose <strong>Copy</strong> &gt;<!-- --> <strong>Copy JS path</strong> (avoid <em>copy selector</em> - it returns faulty selectors from time to time).</li></ul><ul><li>If you paste the content of your clipboard into a text editor, you will see you copied something like:<p><code>document.querySelector("body &gt; ul &gt; button")</code></p><p>We want to take the part that is inside the brackets, without the “”. So, this part:</p><p><code>body &gt; ul &gt; button</code></p></li><li><strong>This is the CSS Selector</strong> we need to paste into the last field in our trigger configuration in GTM (<em>see below</em>).<br><strong>Copy</strong> that value and paste it in. Click <strong>save</strong>.</li></ul><p>Notice you could do this with any element and set up any event trigger in GTM as you like?</p><p>We are not done yet. After setting up the trigger conditions for our event, we have to configure the Google Analytics event tag to make sure the right data is sent to the Google Analytics property.</p><h3 id="create-a-custom-event-tag"><a href="#create-a-custom-event-tag" aria-label="Create a custom event tag" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Create a custom event tag</h3><p>Now that we have a trigger, we need to combine it with an actual event tag. You can think of triggers and tags as the <em>when</em> and <em>what</em> in our example: <br> The trigger defines <em>when</em> we want to track an event (<em>when our button is clicked</em>), and now we will define a GA event, that describes<!-- --> <em>what</em> we do: <em>Send an event to GA including all the right values for the event properties.</em></p><p>Let’s get started.</p><ul><li>In Google Tag Manager go to the tags menu and <em>create a new tag</em>.</li></ul><ul><li>Give the tag a <strong>name</strong> like <em>Button Event</em> and click on<!-- --> <strong>tag configuration</strong>.</li><li>A panel from the right side is going to slide in with a list of possible tag types to choose from. Select<!-- --> <strong>Google Analytics - Universal Analytics</strong>.</li><li>Back in the tag configuration, set the <strong>track type</strong> to <strong>event</strong>. Now you will see more fields showing up for the event data.</li><li>Let’s assign static values for <strong>event category</strong> and <strong>action</strong> and let’s make the <strong>event label</strong> populate dynamically.<br>Call the <strong>category</strong> <em>click events</em>, for example, the <strong>action</strong> is just<!-- --> <em>click</em> and for the <strong>label</strong> click on the Lego brick symbol next to it.</li><li>We want the label to always hold the text that is written on the clicked HTML element, so in case we are tracking multiple buttons, we could distinguish between them.<br>After clicking on the Lego brick, a panel is going to slide in to <strong>choose a variable</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Cyber-crimes affect companies from all industries like IT, Legal, Education, Manufacturing, Finance. Healthcare is one of the most targeted since this sector relies on the perpetual exchange of big volumes of valuable data.</p>
<div><p>Amid a health crisis, a cyberattack targeting healthcare IT systems around the world takes place every three days <a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p><p>Since the beginning of the second decade of this millennium, cyber threats and data breaches increase rate has <a href="https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22026828/cyberattacks-skyrocketed-in-2018-are-you-ready-for-2019" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spiked disturbingly</a>. Cyber regulations are evolving and requiring healthcare facilities to address more than just the patient’s illnesses. Also responsible for the security of their data, they make health care information security a priority. And they are pushed to do it. Any intrusion on the integrity of internal data can have catastrophic consequences for patients and healthcare facilities.</p></div>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/healthcare-breach-barometer-2016-2019.jpg" alt="Healthcare Data Breaches 2016-2019">
<figcaption><small>Healthcare Data Breaches 2016-2019</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<div><p>For healthcare companies, a breach of security is very costly. In this critical context, the health sector must be aware and ready to do everything possible to secure their health applications and data banks, by channeling enough technological and financial resources to them. The data collected in the health sector is particularly sensitive because most records become a significant liability when compromised. Healthcare organizations are prime targets for cybercriminals seeking to gain valuable information by exploiting vulnerable security systems. The risk of a breach is reduced by adopting security measures with mighty authentication methods, paired with employee training – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-fortinet/2019/08/27/the-importance-of-training-cybersecurity-awareness-as-a-firewall/#2693a2cd8b4b%20target=" _blank"="" rel="nofollow">a necessary follow-up action</a> that some companies tend to undermine, and, therefore, risk turning into a headline in cybersecurity news sites.</p><p>One specific area of healthcare is particularly susceptible to cyberattacks, and criminals often use it to create a breakpoint - the company’s supply chain. Because health organizations rely on multiple suppliers and external services, they support a vast network where massive data is on a constant exchange. Securing such an intense pipeline of information flow is exceptionally difficult, and hackers won’t hesitate to abuse this unfortunate fact.</p><p>In the Healthcare sector, computer systems contain sensitive data and support organizations in the delivery of quality patient services, making them a prime target for extortion attempts. Phishing, in which a cybercriminal poses as a legitimate organization or individual to entice trust, is a common form of attack. Emails have always been a possible point of entry, filled with bogus attachments and links to fake websites. Email breach is of particular concern in healthcare, as staff consistently uses emails to exchange highly valuable data. If an employee’s email login information is stolen or disclosed - including their username and password - they can be used by criminals to gain access to patient records, and based on this employee level of access, possibly leverage even further damage.</p></div>
<h2>Applications at the service of health: pay attention to the data!</h2>
<div><p>The concept of e-health is not technologically innovative. The service itself is not advanced by any means; what is innovative is the main piece of technology it uses. This tech choice consists of the provision of communicating applications allowing, here, to perform specific measures via the combined effort of a peripheral, a service platform (mainly based on cloud technologies) and a communication network <a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p><p>The security principles and techniques applicable to e-health are, therefore, very similar to those considered by suppliers of critical connected systems. The main difference is that medical devices process health data, which is among the most lucrative for cybercriminals. Personal medical records reside under the aegis of restrictive regulations. Such regulations impose special protection to guarantee the integrity of the patient’s privacy.</p><p>New black gold, all the corporate data collected and processed, defines the level of risk for the services that use this information. In the case of e-health, all present vulnerabilities and medical data leak possibilities must be eradicated. Data protection can break the integrity of private data. For example, sensitive information can circulate multiple communication channels and get exposed to a breach. Not even the doctor-patient is entirely bulletproof.</p><p>A data communication channel may temporarily break data integrity. For example, doctor-patient communication is vulnerable to data leaks, despite the security-laden non-disclosure agreement they both approve.</p><p>Of course, sensitive data can be partially <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/benefits-of-encryption-technology-for-data-protection">encrypted</a></b> or partially exposed. For example, to explain conditions or medical treatment procedures, doctors use <i>pseudonymization</i>, when communication with their patients. Doctors also use <i>anonymization</i>, when it comes to data as part of statistics or a plan to improve a specific service.</p></div>
<h2>Cybersecurity in the Healthcare sector:</h2>
<p>Healthcare organizations should ensure that they have robust security measures in place to limit the risks of email account compromise <a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, cyber security threat breaches, and other cyber security threat related incidents. These measures must cover all parameters inherent to <i>people, processes, and technologies</i>:
</p><ul><li><b>Practices and procedures</b> – Strong authentication methods, secure access to applications, systems, and data; Communication with staff and other key stakeholders’ regular updates, as well as reminders of safety behaviors and mandatory actions during safety failure;</li>
<li><b>Supplier Relationships</b> – Cybercriminals can exploit any weak link in a supply chain to gain access to a target. “The existence of strong links between companies within a healthcare ecosystem can compromise an entire ecosystem.” This is why, our latest Healthcare app project, MeTime, features a ‘close-quarters’ environment where vendors, clients and suppliers can safely exchange data while preserving privacy integrity.</li>
<li><b>Log management</b> – Healthcare facilities often use a set of proprietary applications and systems that must be linked together within an IT security framework. LogPoint’s highly flexible cybersecurity software architecture addresses this problem and has become the standard cybersecurity tool for log management in the healthcare industry <a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Some of the world’s most advanced hospitals are using our next-generation SIEM solution to protect their patient information.</li>
<li><b>Training</b> – Entry-to-service training, regular reminders, additional training for all staff, and, where appropriate, other stakeholders. Malicious activity isn’t the only activity impacting your organization. Human error - as is the case in any industry - is another risk that deserves attention. Incorrect distribution of information and inappropriate handling of sensitive data puts your organization at high risk for data loss.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware</b> – ransomware is another type of direct cybersecurity threat to the healthcare industry. While this type of attack typically cannot confirm a breach, ransomware has the potential to directly affect the privacy, integrity, and availability of critical systems. It is essential to prepare for the possibility of such an incident and harden your security policies accordingly. The recent spikes in ransomware attacks suggest it is a matter of time when online attackers will cycle toward any possible company. The best move is to expect a blow from that angle and get prepared on that front.</li></ul>
<h2>The potential role of AI for health application security</h2>
<div><p>It is no longer a secret: ensuring the security of information systems is one of the significant challenges in companies. The fight against cybercrime has experienced a small revolution in recent years, thanks to the application of artificial intelligence. Through machine learning, we can discover how threats operate and evolve and use that information for a more precise counter-measure.</p><p>The number one difficulty in cybersecurity is the realization that criminals are always one step ahead of companies: they look for security holes, that someone working for the company is likely to overlook. Also, there is the exponential and ultra-rapid development of <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/new-tech-in-ecommerce">new technologies</a></b>, particularly cloud and mobile. Hackers are quick to learn how new tech can be used to their advantage, and cybersecurity experts must keep up, keeping up with their, looking to predict, and dismantle their attempts.</p><p>Most basic security solutions focus on understanding malware and preventing infiltration. Thus, rather than being in action, they will instead react to present and incoming danger. This passive threat-response strategy requires regular updates, among other things, and their use alone proves to be insufficient. A more sophisticated cyber solution finds an ally in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machines have the intensity and relentlessness needed when battling cyber threats and are preferred tools of veteran cybersecurity experts.</p><p>AI can proactively identify and mitigate a threat even before a patch is developed and released <a href="#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Its main advantage is its ability to relieve the human factor of tedious and time-consuming tasks, and this with a better reaction capacity in the treatment of alerts that flood computer systems daily.</p><p>AI then makes it possible to spot, analyze, and respond to cyber-attacks faster than a human. It provides an instrument which, when applied to cybersecurity, improves the efficiency and strengthens the protection of information technologies, for companies constrained by time and resources, financial or human.</p><p>It is on the processing of data between applications that AI can have a considerable impact. Robotics quickly analyzes a large amount of data from which it can spot anomalies or signal potential threats. Machines learn from a growing set of data and, over time, become more and more precise at detecting abnormalities. Today, Machine Learning finally gains the power to support human expertise in decision-making.</p><p>The future of cybersecurity is about embracing and innovating to …</p></div></div></div>

<article id="5f5c6154ca685c378a7ee720">
<p>September 12, 2020<span></span></p>

<p>AWS Glue is a fully managed serverless ETL service. It is used for ETL purposes and perhaps most importantly used in data lake eco systems. Its high level capabilities can be found in one of &nbsp;my previous post <a href="https://lijjumathew.com/etl-options-in-aws/">here</a>, but in this post I want to detail Glue Catalog, Glue Jobs and an example to illustrate a simple job.</p><h3 id="glue-catalog">Glue Catalog</h3><ul>
<li>Glue catalog is a metadata repository built automatically by crawling the datasets by Glue Crawlers. It contains tables with in a database created by crawlers and these tables can be queried via AWS Athena. Crawlers can crawl S3, RDS, Dynamo DB, Redshift and any on-prem databases that can connect via JDBC. These crawled datasets can further be used as a source or target connection in Glue while developing jobs.</li>
<li>The way crawlers work is, it has built in classifiers and runs these classifiers against the dataset in an orderly fashion. If the classifier cant recognize the data, the crawler invokes the next classifier. We can also build custom classifier and use that. These crawlers can be scheduled to scan at a regular period of time and there is an option to update the schema of the data catalog tables or ignore updates.</li>
<li>Here are some of bad experiences with crawlers that I had which you have to be careful about. One, crawling a dataset in s3 which has millions of small s3 files will take time and can be costly affair. Two, make sure data is organized in partitions and the data set that is crawled has similar files in folder. If that is not the case, say if it has 100 files of different schema, crawler can end up creating 100 tables.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glue-jobs">Glue Jobs</h3><ul>
<li>Glue provides two shells, python shell and spark shell to execute a piece of code. Python shell can be used to can execute plain python code and it is a non distributed environment. The Spark Shell is a distributed environment to execute spark code written in either PySpark or Scala.</li>
<li>While using Spark shell, in addition to data frames and other constructs that spark has, Glue has a new construct called dynamic frames which requires no schema unlike data frame. Dynamic frames has few transformation functions and we can always convert dynamic frame to data frame and vice versa to use each other transformation functions.</li>
<li>Glue dev end point provides an environment to author the jobs and test it. It is an EMR cluster with all glue utilities.</li>
<li>Here are some of the important configuration parameters for Glue jobs.
<ul>
<li>Bookmark is a feature to track data that has already processed by the job in previous runs by persisting the state information. For example if we have a Glue that reads from S3 and the data is partitioned, it reads only new partition data if bookmark option is enabled(disabled by default). This feature can be used for relational sources and it keeps track of the new data by keys defined for the table.</li>
<li>DPU(Data Processing Unit) is the term used to denote the processing power allocated to the glue job. A single DPU is 4 vCpu and 16 GB of memory. Spark job requires minimum of 2 DPUs. Worker type tells what type of nodes. There is standard, G1.X(for memory intensive) and G.2X( for ML Transforms).</li>
<li>Delay notification threshold time can be set to notify (cloud watch) jobs running above the threshold time.</li>
<li>Run time parameters can be passed to job as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Features
<ul>
<li>Metrics - Glue provides spark web ui to monitor and debug the jobs. Job logs can be viewed in cloudwatch.</li>
<li>It also supports streaming ETL where we can set up continuous ingestion pipelines from sources like Kinesis, Kafka and ingest into S3 or other data stores.</li>
<li>It has a feature called workflow to orchestrate the crawlers and jobs with dependencies and triggers.</li>
<li>It also provides an interface to create and work with Sagemaker and Zepplin notebooks.</li>
<li>User defined custom python packages/modules can be used in both the shells by having it zipped and stored in S3.</li>
<li>There is a warm up time involved when you run a Glue job and it use to be around 10 mins. With Glue 2.0 it is brought down to 1 min.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pricing - You are billed only for the time the ETL job takes to run and no upfront cost for startup or shutdown time. It is charged based on number of DPU's used for the job and it is $0.44 per DPU-hour. Glue version 2.0 have a 1-minute billing duration and older versions have a 10-minute minimum billing duration.

<p>Spyware written for educational institutions to flex their muscles of control over students and their families when learning from their home computer is still, categorically, spyware.</p>



<p>Depending on your persuasion, the previous sentence sounds like either needless pedantry, or it reads like tautology. But we need to be clear on our terms.</p>



<ol><li>Educational spyware is still spyware.</li><li>Spyware is categorized as a subset of malware.</li></ol>



<p>When vulnerabilities are discovered in malware, the normal rules of <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">coordinated disclosure</a> are out of scope. Are we clear?</p>







<p>So let’s talk about Proctorio!</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anyone unfamiliar with it, Proctorio is a browser extension used to eliminate cheating through intense surveillance techniques. It records the computer screen while you take the exam to ensure you don’t look anything up. However, it’s more than that. (Thread 1/11)</p>— Cassie (@Angry_Cassie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Angry_Cassie/status/1301360994044850182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>The entire thread is unrolled <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1301360994044850182.html">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I won’t go into the details of Proctorio or why it’s terrible for (especially disadvantaged) students. Read Cassie’s Twitter thread for more context on that. Seriously. I’m not gonna be one of those guys that <em>talks over</em> women, and neither should you.</p>



<p>What I am here to talk about today is these dubious claim about the security of their product:</p>







<h2 id="zero-knowledge">Zero-Knowledge Encryption? OMGWTFBBQ!</h2>



<p>In cryptography, there are a class of algorithms called Zero-Knowledge Proofs. In a Zero-Knowledge Proof, you prove that you possess some fact without revealing any details <em>about</em> the fact.</p>



<p>It’s kind of abstract to think about (and until we’re ready to talk about Pedersen commitments, I’m just going to defer to <a href="https://openprivacy.ca/work/swisspost-scytl-evoting/">Sarah Jamie Lewis</a>), but the only thing you need to know about “Zero Knowledge” in Cryptography is that the output is a boolean (True, False).</p>



<p>You can’t use “Zero Knowledge” <em>anything</em> to encrypt. So “Zero-Knowledge Encryption” is a meaningless buzzword.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a cryptographer, I would like details on how on Earth it is using zero knowledge proofs in this situation. In all likelihood they're not doing what "zero knowledge" usually means, which quite frankly has me more worried about the security, not less.</p>— Buchberger's algorithm fan account (@SchmiegSophie) <a href="https://twitter.com/SchmiegSophie/status/1304407483658592256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>So what are they actually describing when they say Zero Knowledge Encryption?</p>







<p>Okay, so they’ve built their own key distribution system and are encrypting with AES-GCM… and shipped this in a Chrome extension. But before we get to that, look at this <strong>Daily Vulnerability Tests</strong> claim.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1204" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-04/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-04" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Bullshit.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Running Nessus (or equivalent) on a cron job isn’t meaningful metric of security. At best, it creates alert fatigue when you accidentally screw up a deployment configuration or forget to update your software for 4+ years. (Y’know, like JsZip 3.2.1, which they bundle.)</p>



<p>A dumb vulnerability scan isn’t the same thing as a routine (usually quarterly) penetration test or a code audit. And if you’re working in cryptography, <em>you better have both</em>!</p>



<h2 id="vulnerability">Timing Leaks in Proctorio’s AES-GCM Implementation</h2>



<p>If you download version 1.4.20241.1.0 of the Proctorio Chrome Extension, run <code>src/assets/J5HG.js</code> through a JS beautifier, and then look at its contents, you will quickly realize this is a JavaScript cryptography library.</p>



<p>Since the “zero knowledge” encryption they’re so proud about uses AES-GCM, let’s focus on that.</p>



<p>Proctorio’s AES-GCM implementation exists in an object called <code>dhs.mode.gcm</code>, which is mildly obfuscated, but contains the following functions:</p>



<ul><li><code>encrypt()</code> – Encrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>decrypt()</code> – Decrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>aa()</code> – GHASH block multiplication</li><li><code>j()</code> – XOR + GMAC utility function</li><li><code>O()</code> – Called by encrypt() and decrypt(); does all of the AES-CTR + GMAC fun</li></ul>



<p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a>, just know this: <a href="https://cryptologie.net/article/361/breaking-https-aes-gcm-or-a-part-of-it/">Timing leaks</a> can be used to leak your GMAC key to outside applications, which completely breaks the authentication of AES-GCM and opens the door to chosen-ciphertext attacks.</p>



<p>So is their implementation of AES-GCM constant-time? Let’s take a look at <code>aa()</code>:</p>


<pre title="">aa: function(a, b) {
  var c, d, e, f, g, h = dhs.bitArray.ba;
  for (e = [0, 0, 0, 0], f = b.slice(0), c = 0; 128 &gt; c; c++) {
    for (
      (d = 0 !== (a[Math.floor(c / 32)] &amp; 1 &lt;&lt; 31 - c % 32)) &amp;&amp; (e = h(e, f)),
        g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3]),
        d = 3;
      d &gt; 0;
      d--
    )
      f[d] = f[d] &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 | (1 &amp; f[d - 1]) &lt;&lt; 31;
    f[0] &gt;&gt;&gt;= 1,
    g &amp;&amp; (f[0] ^= -520093696)
  }
  return e
},
</pre>


<p>This is a bit obtuse, but this line leaks the lowest bit of <code>f</code> with each iteration: <code>g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3])</code>.</p>



<p>Since <code>f</code> gets bitwise right-shifted 128 times, this actually leaks the bit of every value of <code>f</code> in each block multiplication, since the execution of <code>(f[0] ^= -520093696)</code> depends on whether or not <code>g</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>

So much for “zero-knowledge”!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Also, they claim to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, but this is how they generate randomness in their cryptography library.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>(Although, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search?SearchMode=Basic&amp;Vendor=Proctorio&amp;CertificateStatus=Active&amp;ValidationYear=0">that’s probably a lie</a>.)</p>



<p>To mitigate these vulnerabilities, one needs look no further than <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#conditional-select">the guide to side-channel attacks</a> I published last month. </p>



<p>(Also, use WebCrypto to generate entropy! What the fuck.)</p>



<h2>If Proctorio is Insecure, What Should We Use Instead?</h2>



<p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>



<p>Schools that demand students install spyware on their personal computers are only a step removed from domestic abusers who install stalkerware on their victims’ phones.</p>



<p>Proctorio isn’t the problem here, they’re only a symptom.</p>



<p>Schools that insist on violating the integrity and parental dominion of their students’ home computers are the problem here.</p>

</div><figcaption>Preach!</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you want to ensure the integrity of students’ education, try teaching them about consent and ethical computing. (Y’know, concepts that are fundamentally incompatible with the business model of Proctorio and Proctorio’s competitors.)</p>



<h2 id="timeline">Disclosure Timeline</h2>



<p>Really? <em>Really?</em></p>



<p>This was a zero-day disclosure, because full disclosure is the responsible choice when dealing with spyware. Don’t even @ me.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to protect your home network from this spyware, here are a list of domains to sinkhole (i.e. with <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a>).</p>

<h2>STEP 1</h2>
<p><strong>Table.</strong> Start by building a sturdy table. This table-top is a 3’x3′ square of 3/4″ thick plywood. The legs are 1½” x 1½” square and about 37″ long, with triangular braces cut from 1½” x 8″x 12″ wooden pieces. The legs are splayed out slightly to give the table strength and allow the rotary pendulum to swing without hitting a leg.</p>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> screw and/or glue the braces to the legs first, and then cut their tops together at a slight angle with a table or circular saw. Adjust the leg lengths to give a table-top height of about 37″.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> if you want to fit the table through doorways without taking off the legs, you might need slightly shorter legs and pendulums.</p></div>

<figcaption><strong>Holes for Pendulums</strong>. Drill 3 holes of 3″ diameter through the table surface for the pendulums to hang through. The rotary pendulum’s hole should be centered in a corner about 8″ from each side just clear of the leg brace underneath. The other two holes should be aligned near the opposite edges, about 8″ from the common side, and 3″ from the other. You’ll need a particular sizeable circular drill bit for this. Alternatively, you can first drill a smaller hole, and then cut a wider opening with a jigsaw.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Plates to support pendulums</strong>. Mount two metal plates (about 1¼” x 4″) on the sides of the two lateral pendulum holes and drill a small indentation in each plate’s center. <p><strong>Tip:</strong> first, start the indentation in the metal plate with a small drill bit (such as 1/8″) and then continue with a larger bit (such as 1/4″). Be careful not to drill all the way through. Tip: unless you have a good drill press, it may be easier to position the indentations of the plates on the table after you create the fulcrum blocks with protruding screws below, because it can be harder to accurately position the screws in the blocks later to align with the indentations.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Pendulums.</strong> The rotary pendulum needs a gimbal mechanism that allows it to swing in any direction. This is made from a large metal washer with 2½” outer and 1″ inner diameter. The washer rests on screw tips protruding from under the table, and then the pendulum rests on the washer. Drill pairs of indentations into the washer on each side, off 90 degrees between the sides, to allow rocking on two perpendicular axes.<p>Here are views of the rotary pendulum gimbal from above and below the table. In the picture from below, note the oak blocks (3/4″ x 1½” x 5″) supporting the two screws (1¾” #10) protruding upwards and diagonally. File down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed, so the pendulum doesn’t hit them when it swings. Likewise, file down the corners of the fulcrum block if necessary so it doesn’t hit the table when swinging.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Weights.</strong> 2½ lb lifting weights from a sporting goods store work well, but typically have a 1″ interior hole. You can stack several weights and slide them together onto the 3/4″ pendulum dowel by using a 5″ long 3/4″ metal pipe nipple, with a 3/4″ to 1″ bushing screwed onto the lower end. A 1″ steel clamp attached to the dowel fixes the weights from sliding off and allows easy adjustment of the weight’s height to give different swinging frequencies.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Paper Platform. </strong>Cut about 1″ off the top of the rotary pendulum dowel, so it is slightly lower than the other two. Then mount an 11″x11″ square of thin 1/8″ board to the top of this pendulum, using a small oak block glued to it for support, with a 3/4″ hole for the dowel. Wrap some tape around the dowel’s top to get a tight fit, or glue it on.<p>*** Use two rubber bands, or some clips, to hold the paper in place on the platform. If the form slips on the platform, spray a thin layer of temporary adhesive on the platform to make it slightly sticky.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Arms.</strong> Connect a 30″ long balsa stick to the top of each lateral pendulum using a thin nail. Bend the nail back and forth a little in the balsa to allow the arm to rotate smoothly and move up and down slightly. The nail hole will slowly loosen further during use.<p>To make a simple pen-holder, drill a 1/2″ hole on the end of one arm, and cut about 4″ down the arm’s center to make a clothes-pin like a device. Alternatively, glue a real clothes-pin to the end of one of the arms. Pictures of both versions are shown.</p><p>Finally, attach the two arms with a doubled-over rubber band, as shown.</p><p>Note that if you plan to use your harmonograph regularly, such as in a museum setting, a more robust solution for these arms that won’t wear as quickly might be necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;An alternate version of the arm-pendulum connection is shown to the right that uses a magnetic ball joint instead of the simple nail method above. Glue one 3/8″ spherical magnet to the arm (making sure the N/S alignment is horizontal by connecting a second magnet). File a hole in the side of a nylon cylinder (1″ height, 1/2″ outer and 3/8″ inner diameter) and use smaller cylinders (3/8″ outer diameter) to hold another magnet inside that can rotate freely. Then glue the cylinder to the top of the pendulum.</p></figcaption></figure>

</figure></li></ul><figcaption><strong>Pen Lifter.</strong> It is convenient to raise and lower the pen gently without disturbing the motion of the pendulums. To do this, insert a 30″ pole into a hole near the center of the table, just far enough from the paper platform that it won’t be hit by it (about 12″ from the rotary pendulum hole). Attach an oak block under the table for a deeper hole and better support. Tie a string to the balsa arms where they are connected, lead it through a screw-eye on top of the pole, and back down to a small jam cleat or groove where it can hold the pen in place above the paper until you are ready to lower it.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Step 10</h2>
<p><strong>Pens.</strong> Experiment with pens and markers of various types and colors. Generally, wide pens or thin markers seem to work best. Here are some I’ve had good luck with so far:</p>
<ul><li>Uniball GEL Impact in Silver, use on black or dark paper.</li><li>Staedtler Triplus Rollerball Pens (.4mm) in various colors</li><li>Pigma Graphic 1 (1.0mm) in black</li><li>Sakura Identi Pen in black, purple, etc.</li></ul>
<p>but many other types of pens may also work well.</p>
<h2>Adjustments</h2>
<p><strong>Weight Height</strong>. Adjust a pendulum’s weight height to change its swinging frequency. The frequency of a pendulum varies with the inverse of the square root of its length, so to swing twice as fast, the length between the fulcrum and its center-of-mass would need to be 1/4 of the original length (which may not be practical with this harmonograph). For a 3:2 or 4:3 frequency increase, the weights would be raised around 19″ or 15″ respectively, although you should probably do some timing tests to find and mark these heights experimentally.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Amount</strong>. Add more weight to a pendulum to counteract friction and make the swinging last longer. I’ve found that 5 lb (2 x 2½) on the rotary pendulum, and 7½ lb (3 x 2½) on the other two works reasonably well. Note that adding more weight does not generally change the frequency of the pendulum.</p>
<p><strong>Phase and Amplitude</strong>. Each time you swing the pendulums to make a new drawing, each pendulum’s relative phases, and amplitudes will vary. Try somewhere the rotary pendulum, and the lateral pendulums are initially making circles in the same or opposite directions. Try somewhere the lateral pendulums are initially swinging in phase to make a diagonal line.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>Two-pendulum results</strong>. To simplify things, you can lock …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></main></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most people might not understand it’s power, and some might not know how to use it. A strong knowledge of <a href="https://archive.org/">WBM</a> is probably more important now than it ever was.</p>

<p>You know what’s better than a time machine? A <em>weaponized time machine…</em></p>
<h2 id="why-waybackmachine-is-powerful">Why WayBackMachine is Powerful</h2>
<p>The WayBackMachine basically gives you the ability to travel back in time on the internet.</p>
<p>It also allows you to freeze a moment of time on the internet.</p>
<p>Like any genuine time machine, it can be challenging to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be slow at times.</li>
<li>It can be slow at times.</li>
<li>Recalled moments in time can be missing elements such as pictures or video.</li>
<li>It might not be obvious how to control the time circuits (advanced features should be learned to properly filter search results).</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite some of these faults, textual context is hardly ever lacking.</p>

<p>This is what makes time travel possible.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/">WBM</a> does not apologize. It doesn’t sensor what you find. If you take the time machine to a place where something bad happened, you must be prepared to see what happened.</p>
<p>In an experiment to see how far back in time I could travel in Hawaii news, I saw an elephant go rogue and stampede people (1994). I’ve seen many high-casualty-action-movies, but this sad to witness because I knew it was real.</p>

<p>Quite often content is posted and then removed or edited when things heat up. If you recognize a topic is controversial or important, you may wish to quickly archive it <a href="https://archive.org/web/">https://archive.org/web/</a>.

<p>There are many important events that were either preceded by – or the result of – things happening on the internet.</p>
<p>Knowing this, as well as the web-presence of the people involved in such events, with a little skilled WBM use you can bring to the surface that which had previously sunk into the depths of internet history.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a professional investigator to get to the bottom of what happened, whether the events be minor or catastrophic. You just have to know how to search the internet.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-truth-promoter">as a truth-promoter…</h3>
<p>In the pre-internet days, history was written by the winners.</p>
<p>These days, however, history is recorded in real time. Its hard to rewrite events under the passive and accidental surveillance system that the internet is.</p>
<p>Events that happened in recent decades will often have an internet counterpart that can be studied.</p>
<p>With some clever WBM piloting, you can use the power of truth to dethrone that which had previously prospered in a lie.</p>
<p>So for those who are involved in current issues that were effected by the recent past, WBM cannot be overlooked.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>There's something I have to get off my chest. If you really need to, just read the TLDR and listen to the Justin Bieber parody posted below. If you’re confused by the lingo, the rest of the post will fill in any gaps.</p><div><p>TL;DR: Benchmarketing, the practice of using benchmarks for marketing, is bad. Consumers should run their own benchmarks and ideally open-source them instead of relying on an internal and biased report.</p><p>Enjoy the song I wrote about this silly practice.</p></div><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSy8V-R0_Zw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>For the longest time, I have wondered what is the point of corporations, specifically in the database sectors, running their own benchmarks. Would a company ever have any incentive to post results from a benchmark that didn't show its own system winning in at least the majority of cases? I understand that these benchmarks have become part of the furniture we come to expect to see when visiting any hot new database's website. I doubt anybody in the public domain gains much insight out of these results, to begin with, at least nothing they weren't expecting to see. </p><p>Now to be clear, I am in no way indicating that companies running their own internal benchmarks to analyze their own performance in comparison to their competitors is a bad thing. It’s when they take those results and intentionally skew the methods or data from these benchmarks for sales or marketing purposes that is the problem we’re discussing here. Vendors that take part in the practice, not only use these benchmarks to show their systems succeeding a little but rather perversely taint their methodology with settings, caching, and other performance enhancements, while leaving their competition’s settings untouched. </p><p>This should be obvious that this is NOT what benchmarking is about! If you read about the history of the <a href="http://www.tpc.org/information/about/history5.asp">Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC)</a> you come to understand that this is the very wrongdoing that the council was created to address. But like with any proxy involving measurements, the measurements are inherently pliable.</p><blockquote>By the spring of 1991, the TPC was clearly a success. Dozens of companies were running multiple TPC-A and TPC-B results. Not surprisingly, these companies wanted to capitalize on the TPC's cachet and leverage the investment they had made in TPC benchmarking. Several companies launched aggressive advertising and public relations campaigns based around their TPC results. In many ways, this was exactly why the TPC was created: to provide objective measures of performance. What was wrong, therefore, with companies wanting to brag about their good results? What was wrong is that there was often a large gap between the objective benchmark results and their benchmark marketing claims--this gap, over the years, has been dubbed "benchmarketing." So the TPC was faced with an ironic situation. It had poured an enormous amount of time and energy into creating a good benchmark and even a good benchmark review process. However, the TPC had no means to control how those results were used once they were approved. The resulting problems generated intense debates within the TPC.</blockquote><p>This benchmarketing ultimately fails the clients that these companies are marketing to. It demonstrates not only a lack of care for addressing the users' actual pain but a lack of respect by intentionally pulling the wool over their eyes simply in an attempt to mask that their performance isn't up to par with their competitors. <strong>This leads to consumers not being able to make informed decisions as most of our decisions are made from gut instincts and human emotion which these benchmarks aim to manipulate.</strong></p><p>If you’re not sure exactly how a company would pull this off, an example of might be that database A enables using a cost-based optimizer that requires precomputing statistics about different tables involved in the computation, while database B is running a query against this table without any type of stats based optimization made available to it. Database A will clearly dominate as now it can reorder joins and apply better execution plans while database B is going to go with the simplest plan and run much slower in most scenarios. The company whose product depends on database A will then hone in on the numerical outcomes of this report. Even if they're decent enough to report the methods they skewed to get these results, they bury it within their report and focus on advertising the outcome of what would otherwise be considered an absurd comparison. Companies will even go as far as to say that their competition's database wasn't straight forward to configure when they were setting up optimizations. If you're not capable of understanding how to make equivalent changes to both systems, well then I guess you don't get to run that comparison until you figure it out. &nbsp;</p><p>Many think that consumers are not susceptible to such attacks and would be able to see right through this scheme, but these reports appeal to any of us when we don't have the necessity or resources to thoroughly examine all the data. Many times we have to take cues from our gut when a decision needs to be made and the time to make it is constrained by our time and other business needs. We see this type of phenomenon described in the book, <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman. To briefly summarize the model they use, there are two modes that humans use when they reason about their decisions, System 1 and System 2.</p><blockquote>Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine — usually.</blockquote><p>No surprise, that’s usually the part where we get into trouble. While we like to think that we are generally thinking in the logical System 2 mode, we don't have time or energy to live in this space for long periods throughout the day and we find ourselves very reliant on System 1 for much of our decision making.</p><blockquote>The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant. When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions.</blockquote><p>This is why benchmarketing can be so dangerous because it is so effective at manipulating our belief in claims that simply aren't true. These decisions affect how your architecture will unfold, your time-to-value, and lost hours for your team and customers. It makes having these systems that fairly compare the performance and merits of two systems all-the-more paramount.</p><figure><img src="http://bitsondata.dev/content/images/2020/09/significant.png" alt=""><figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/882/">https://xkcd.com/882/</a></figcaption></figure><p>So why am I talking about this now?</p><p>I have become a pretty big fanboy of a <a href="https://prestosql.io/">Presto</a>, a distributed query engine that runs interactive queries from many sources. I have witnessed firsthand how fast a cluster of Presto nodes are able to process through a huge amount of data at blindingly fast speeds. When you dive into how these speeds are achieved you find that this project is an incredible modern feat of solid engineering that makes interactive analysis over petabytes of data a reality. Going into all the reasons I like this project would be too tangential but it fuels the fire for why I believe this message needs to be heard.</p><p>Recently there was a "benchmark" that came out comparing the performance of a commercial competitor and Presto open-source and enterprise versions, touting performance improvements over Presto by an amount that would have been called out as too high in a CSI episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU">&lt;insert canonical csi clip here&gt;</a>. If you need to find out what I’m talking about, simply google "presto benchmark 3000" and you will find the benchmark along with plenty of other hype they've generated around these "findings". <a href="https://blog.yugabyte.com/yugabytedb-vs-cockroachdb-bringing-truth-to-performance-benchmark-claims-part-1/">Presto isn't the only system in the data space to come under similar types of attacks.</a> It makes sense too, as this type of technical peacocking is common as it successfully gains attention. </p><p>Luckily, as more companies strive to become transparent and associate themselves with open-source efforts, we are starting to see a relatively new pattern of open-source efforts emerge. Typically, you're used to hearing about open-source within the context of software projects maintained by open-source communities. We are now arriving at the age of any noun being able to be used in an open-source framework. There is open-source music, open-source education, and even open-source data. So why not reach a point where open-source benchmarking through consumer collaboration is a thing. This is not just for the sake of the consumers of these technologies who simply want to have more data to inform their design choices to better serve their clients, it's also unfortunate that this affects developer communities that are putting in a lot of hard work on these projects, only to have that hard work get berated unintelligibly by the likes of some corporate status competition.</p><p>Now I'm clearly a little biased when I tell you that I think Presto is currently the best analytics engine on the market today. When I say this, you really should be skeptical too. Really, I encourage it. You should verify in some way beyond a shadow of a doubt that:</p><p> &nbsp;1.

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>4</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>I’m currently working on a series of episodes for a Podcast I’ll be publishing soon. The Podcast will be in Italian and I wanted to make sure to publish the episode transcripts together with the audio episodes.</p>



<p>The idea of manually typing all the episodes text wasn’t really appealing to me so I started looking around.</p>



<h2>What are the tools out there?</h2>



<p>From a quick Google search, it seems that some companies are offering a mix of automated and human-driven transcription services.</p>



<p>I wasn’t really interested in that for now. I was, of course, just interested in consuming an API I could push my audio to and get back some text in a reasonable amount of time.</p>



<p>For this reason, I started looking for <em>speech-to-text</em> APIs and, of course, the usual suspects figured among the first results.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text">IBM Watson Speech-to-Text</a></li><li><a href="https://www.speechmatics.co/">SpeechMatics</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">Google Cloud Speech-to-Text</a></li></ul>



<p>To be quite honest, I didn’t spend too much time investigating the solutions above. I probably spent more time reading about them to write this blog post.</p>



<p>I decided to go with Google Cloud because I’ve never used GCP before and wanted to give it a try. Additionally, the documentation for it seemed quite straightforward, as well as the support for Italian as language to transcribe from (the podcast is in Italian). I also had a few free credits available because I’ve never used GCP for personal use before.</p>



<h2>Setting up</h2>



<p>If you want to try transcribing your episodes too, follow this quick setup guide to get started.</p>



<p>Head over to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> and set up an account. Make sure you create a project and enable the Speech-to-Text API. If you forget to do so <code>gcloud</code> will be able to take care of that for you, later.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="509" height="99" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59.png" alt="Google Cloud Speech-to-Text" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59.png 509w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"><figcaption>Google Cloud Speech-to-Text</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Second thing I did was installing <code><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts">gcloud</a></code>, the CLI Google Cloud provides for interacting with the APIs. This time I was only interested in testing the API so it seemed to me that this tool was the only way to get started quickly.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s not much you can do from the Google Cloud Web Console if you want to deal with Speech-to-Text APIs.</p>



<h3>Get your file ready for transcription</h3>



<p>Sampling rate for your audio file should be at least 16 kHz for better results. Additionally, GCP recommends a lossless codec. I only had an mp3 of my episode handy at the time so I gave it a try anyway and it worked well enough.</p>



<p><strong>Make sure you know the sample rate of your file, though, because specifying a wrong one might lead to poor results.</strong></p>



<p>You can usually verify the sample rate by getting info on your file from your Mac’s Finder:</p>







<p>You can read more about the recommended settings on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/best-practices">Best Practices</a> section.</p>



<h3>Upload your episode to the bucket</h3>



<p>GCP needs your file to be available from a Storage Bucket so, go ahead and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets">create one</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cloud.google.com/storage/images/create-bucket.png" alt=""><figcaption>Storage Bucket creation example</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll be able to upload your episode from there.</p>



<h2>Time to transcribe</h2>



<p>Once you have your episode file up there in the cloud go back to your local machine terminal were you have configured the <code>gcloud</code> tool.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1024x175.png" alt="" width="580" height="99" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1024x175.png 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-300x51.png 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-768x131.png 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1536x263.png 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>Gcloud used to trigger the speech-to-text transcription</figcaption></figure>



<p>If your episode lasts longer than 60 seconds (😬) you’ll want to use <code>recognize-long-running</code> and most likely specify <code>--async</code>. </p>



<p>As I said before, make sure you specify the right <code>--sample-rate</code>: in my case 44100. This will help GCP transcribe your file with better results.</p>



<p>The <code>--async</code> switch creates a long-running asynchronous operation. It took around 5 minutes for me to have the operation complete. </p>



<p>Oddly, I wasn’t able to find any reference to the asynchronous operation from my Google Cloud Console. So, if you want to be able to know what happened to your transcription job, make sure you take note of the operation identifier. You’ll need it to query the <code>speech operations</code> API for information about your transcription job.</p>

<h2>The transcribed data</h2>



<p>Once your transcription operation is complete the <code>describe</code> command will return the transcript excerpts, together with the confidence rate.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1024x641.png" alt="" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1024x641.png 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-300x188.png 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-768x481.png 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1536x962.png 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The speech transcript excerpt</figcaption></figure>



<p>I wasn’t particularly interested in the <code>confidence</code> rate, I only wanted a big blob of text to be able to review and use for SEO purposes as well as to be able to include it with the episode. For this reason, <strong><em>jq to the resque!</em></strong></p>



<p>I love <code><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a></code>, you can achieve so much with when it comes to manipulate JSON.</p>



<p>In my case, I only wanted to concatenate all the <code>transcript</code> fields and save them to a file. Here’s how I did:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ ./bin/gcloud ml speech operations describe &lt;your-transcription-operation-id&gt; | jq '.response.results[].alternatives[].transcript' &gt; my-transcript.txt</pre>



<p>And that’s it!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I thought of sharing the steps above because they’ve been useful to me in producing the transcripts. I think GCP Speech-to-Text works quite well with Italian but, of course, the transcript is not suitable to be used as it is, unless your accent is perfect. Mine wasn’t 😅.</p>

<h2 id="cs-294-165-fall-2020-syllabus-fall20-syllabus">CS 294-165 - Fall 2020 (<a href="https://www.sketchingbigdata.org/fall20/syllabus">Syllabus</a>)</h2>

<p><strong><strong>Sketching algorithms</strong></strong> compress data in a way that is still useful for answering some pre-specified family of queries, possibly across datasets by comparing sketches. This course will cover mathematically rigorous models for developing such algorithms, as well as some provable limitations of algorithms operating in those models. Some topics covered include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Streaming algorithms.</strong> Compute useful statistics over a dataset making only one pass over it, while using little memory.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dimensionality reduction.</strong> General techniques and impossibility results for reducing data dimension while still preserving geometric structure.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Randomized linear algebra.</strong> Algorithms for big matrices (e.g. a user/product rating matrix for Netflix or Amazon). Regression, low rank approximation, clustering, etc.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Compressed sensing.</strong> Recovery of (approximately) sparse signals based on few linear measurements.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a graduate course, though there may be room for a limited number of advanced undergraduate students satisfying the following prerequisites: mathematical maturity and comfort with algorithms (e.g. CS 170), discrete probability, and linear algebra.</p>
